0	1	dont be a dick
1	1	it is true that black men are less religious but they also have more to gain by proving that they are straight by demeaning gay men
2	1	you want some cat
3	1	i think your family might be weird sorry sis
4	1	you are so sweet i honestly needed to hear kind words today
5	1	its funny because when i first met him i joked about being a sugar baby now im bout to get serious forget having feelings involved run me that money and those career tips
6	1	whenever we bring it up its divisive which is a total copout tbh the difference in treatment and perception is blatant most black couples ive seen the woman was significantly lighter than the man most its a silent issue that no one wants to talk about because so many people would be exposedtbh i dont see much of a difference socially between blk men exclusively pursuing light skinned women and them exclusively pursuing white women they both can be not in every situation symptoms of a desire for status granted by proximity to whiteness the only difference is that one can be categorized as black love which makes it more socially acceptable in black enclaves and im not saying this to denounce the blackness of light skinned people at all im not saying this to be divisive these are just my observations
7	1	you know that post was prompted by black men clowning black women on social media right you can get your whataboutism out of here because i could say the same thing about black men on twitter and instagram both white owned white supremacist platforms openly trashing black women particularly dark skinned black women on a regular basis but youll see what you want to see i guess the poster even said that not all black men were like this and yet you still got up in arms are you upset that your parody post on blackfellas was taken down or something boy bye cause this space wasnt even meant for you in the first place more worried about how white people percieve you than the actual experiences of more than a few black womenthose bad things that the posts said about black men were literally just black women speaking on their own experiences why does that bother you so much if it does then take it up with black men dont try to silence black women
8	1	thanks for sharing their friendship is so cute amp theyre fun to listen to
9	1	this is sweet and i hope this happens to me are you with anyone now
10	1	im not sure what you mean by that or how someones style of hair and makeup contribute to that
11	1	mannnn idk whether to look sideways at the post or open my eyes wider at the type of question in that type community
12	1	1 for rafrodisiac
13	1	i knew my fiancée was special because she was the first black woman of several i dated who didnt fetishize my whiteness and actually appreciates men of any race like a wellbalanced human beingthe whole swirl culture is just kinda gross tbh
14	1	im not interested in seeing the lion king remake with her either
15	1	wellsaid i came here to say this but you put it into words way better than i could
16	1	im like 999 sure this message is from a man
17	1	really frank didnt do anything for you
18	1	great response and edits lolthe only two men that i dated have both been black and honestly although it didnt work out with them there was a comfort and respect there that i enjoyed not to mention they were quite handsome and i felt like we were on the same playing field plus they both thought i was very beautiful and were attracted to me meeting these two guys and my experiences with them was interesting for me it made me think ooo look at thatbut one thing i did notice is that they were not american one from the uk and the other was from sa i dont know if there is a point to be made here but the black men that would go to my university pwi or i would come across randomly i would not even think they would be interested in me and plus they do not show signs of interest  it honestly does not cross my mind at all anymore to be honest if i do see a black guy in the city store or somewhere in america a potential date is nowhere in my thoughts if theyre handsome i note that and just go about my daybecause honestly there seems an energy with certain black men who are strangers that if we start speaking by chance they start acting as if i like them just a weird energy that is unnecessary with other men or strangers things seems to go smoother if we chat by chance everyone is friendly then we leave with a black guy idk maybe some think due to the media reporting that black women are all single or their own views on black women is lack of desirability or about their own masculine attractiveness esp educated black men especially exhibit some sort of special snowflake aura that ordinary black women they meet out and about must like them and then sometimes they act unnecessarily cold as if there is some social competitiveness and they have to fend off your interesti remember there was this one time at some boring tech event in sf i was the only black women there and there was only a  few black men too i go to get some snacks in the corner that is pretty isolated here i was inspecting the snacks to see which one id like and then this black guy comes to the corner to get a snack in any other normal environment due to the proximity of such a closed off isolated space and being that this is a networking event as well the two people would naturally exchange pleasantries what have yous talk about the snacks briefly this is usually what happens and has been happening at every network event i would go to because i stay near the snacks however in this instance nope the guy literally stood a couple of inches from me i was trying to maybe just say hello so it can not be awkward and be polite but he came to this isolated corner avoided eye contact angled his back away then after a few minutes he walked off briskly and im thinking geez louis just always some weird energyfrom college and highschool pwi and beyond ive had enough experiences and observations and conversations with friends for us to realize that the few eligible black men that were in these academic circles were searching for others that is it it stopped there there wasnt many of them and i remember fun days when my friends and i would go through the options and concluded that the few black men here were either gay athletes who werent checking for us or they were either currently in relationship or nogo for other reasons as in they were players etc we would just laugh at it my college life although we had such a blast dancing with men in partiesclubs in our daily lives we had no crushes lmao just us our books and our shenaniganshowever my experiences were definitely impacted by the institutions i went to i remember going to a diverse middle school but i was a awkward little skinny young thing so didnt have any romantic experiences but black girls and black boys and latino girls and boys asian filipino white they all were dating with each other and one another so i know in another reality if i stayed in more diverse settings maybe my dating resume would be quite different
19	1	thanks brother
20	1	no offense but what would be the purpose of talking to her she made it clear she doesnt care for you like that is she like the queen bee of the school why do you and other friends want you to be around her like that
21	1	probably feeling some type of way because he got rejected by black women that or he a black guy who only dates outside his race and is mad that he gets called out for putting down black women
22	1	do you wanna make a new subreddit and discord  theres a niche we could fill
23	1	no you have to be added by a moderator as an approved submitter were currently using that for another purpose well its intended purposeapproved submitters can submit if the subreddit is set to restrictedwe have 25k subscribers we dont know who all those are 1 rule says 99 are lurkers and the traffic bears that out i can write a script to add people quick math 25k6060 60 requestminute would take about 7 hours but again we dont know who they are so wed have to create a process to let people apply wed have to vet them somehow then add them it is a lot of work and it is not foolproof in my experience once youre over 150 people it is not safe any moremy suggestiontell the reddit admins we as in moderators cosigned by by many other community moderators wrote an open letterhttpwwwredditcomrdiscusstheopenletter a few years ago and some things changed and id say it did improve but you users are the primary customers and product and you know there is got to be a better way
24	1	grits are trash but leave turnip greens out of this
25	1	me too i didnt like elementary school that much and middle school was hell
26	1	idk its for allstar weekend and she just said a dress
27	1	ohhhhhhhh ok
28	1	from what i have observed it is asian guys who according to that dating survey from a couple of years ago are the least desired male demographic that survey also said that black women are the least desired female demographic that is why they apparently equate the two
29	1	and comedians like these literally make a living on shitting on marginalized people or make dick jokes it is also an era of ironic bigotry where we have a comedian or creator just present their shitty views through the veil of a persona and say it is just a joke but then you get your share of the likes of louis ck bill cosby etc you also have to remember how many minstrel shows and the like were racist caricatures and werent considered such because it was just a performance and we havent departed far from that when people criticize this stuff it is rarely an internal feeling of being attacked but instead the fact that these people draw in large numbers of shitty people who especially use minority comedians as a form of validation it is why chris rock and dave chappelle stopped their black people vs nas routine and chappelle with pretty much everythingpeople werent laughing at the deconstruction they just loved the racism of itso if someone makes light of fun of say rape and draws in a large crowd of people who then proceed to laugh around it then it is not an issue of just being sensitive were literally paying people to shit on minorities and then create a large crowd of assholes to meme about themsensitivity is not a joke killerexpecting comedians to make the same tired old jokes they have been running for about 4 decades now is the joke killer theyll survive if they can be asked to not make a joke about say a woman being raped when statistically it is highly likely if not certain that at least some of the audience has been rapedthe whole narrative about pc culture and sensitivity is born out of uncomfortable white people in positions of privilege now upset that they have to deal with basic decency
30	1	i learned to never read the comments from wreck it ralph 2

32	1	yeah that is what i was thinking
33	1	im not going to lie i fell for the royal tourist trap when i went to england i would have gone to england regardless but i did go to windsor castle and bought tea in the gift shop just because it had a picture of the queen
34	1	id really like to understand our black peoples obsession with mm shes a black woman who married the colonizers gives up most of the control of her own life and we were like really excited weird to me
35	1	wownever have i ever felt like someone was reading my own words back at me im in the exact same situation to a t been a bit over a years and i still wake up every day missing her distance has made it obvious that we had a lot of issues but i still cant help myself from daydreaming of how my life would have been if we would have stayed togetherall this to say i know how you feel
36	1	yep me too and id write them in artistic ways with different fonts and sizes to paint a picture with the lyrics  made me feel like i was a part of some secret society of artists lol  whatever works for you op just remember high school is not forever certainly not the best years of your life and definitely not the whole universe you will get out and find a community that will love and embrace you  for exactly who you are

42	1	theres no tinfoil hat required for this one republicans have been slowly backing away from trump for a while now and they really only barely tolerated him to begin with republicans have mastered the tactic of making a mess and loudly blaming everyone else for it the democrats are to blame for the government shutdown because they dont want to secure our borders and the minute mueller closes in on trump theyll blame everything on him too i just hope he takes down pence at the same time
43	1	nobody is talking about megachurch administrative needs i specifically mentioned their excess but i understand why so many people are uncomfortable having a straightforward conversation about that
44	1	httpswwwgooglecomampsampcnncomcnn20170307politicsblackswrongfulconvictionsstudyindexhtmlaccording to the us bureau of justice statistics bjs in 2013 black males accounted for 37 of the total male prison population white males 32 and hispanic males 22 white females comprised 49 of the prison population in comparison to black females who accounted for 22 of the female populationhttpswwwnaacporgcriminaljusticefactsheet httpblackdemographicscompopulationblackwomenstatisticsyou are speaking as if im taking away what weve done im not taking away im not watering anything down and im not comparing black men to women im showing sites and articles that support my thoughts im asking what do we add and do we count black men apart of this movement you amongst  are literally taking my whole message to another notch that i dont even believe or particpate in this conversation needs to be talked about bc we freakin raising them for goodness sakes stop thinking another individual is trying to attack you im not your damn enemy i have sons i have a husband i have uncles etc im worried and it startling that when a black women mention the dynamics of black men you just assume im trying to take away the hardship we i go through
45	1	respectfully rblackladies isnt an uncommon name and it is been an established community long enough that going private wont diminish its relevance for a while
46	1	gtthis implies the sole reason to go to school is for a capitalist definition of productivityfor most people capitalism is literally the only reason theyre going to a traditional college or university there are too many other ways to learn for its own sake
47	1	thanks however if that was the case then it would be crystal clear what black is or isnt at least to a outsider moving into the namerican culture but it is not there are people who believe that black to be solely a culture  and rightly so while others believe it is features and colorso i can brand black if it is color based but not culture based
48	1	gt caucasity i still die whenever someone uses that word

51	1	gtwhen black women say black men date outside if their race i be wondering where do these black women live is it idaho montanathe internet her two main examples are instagram and tinder with a preppy black guy who isnt your typical black male experience which are two shitty internet platforms even if my cousin found her husband on tinder
52	1	gtwe all are if it is not in the home it is in media music and communities try hypermasculinity  but yet other choose to improve and help others gtim not sure what point youre trying to make  point our voice is heard louder than other political group i cant say who associates themselves with blm but even that group is spoken by women gtyoure not being shut down youre getting an answer you dont want to hearum no im getting responses that dont line up to what im questioning im getting responses and statistics on women i know that the convo is to acknowledge if men should be included or not and how theres not enough of them for their voices to heard gtthey need to do more and start in their own spaces they already did i gave you examples and findings already of what theyre doing that youre probably aware of yourself it is just not enough of them gtre are plenty of black men around theyre busy on reddit twitter and all over social media look at the size and activity of blackfellas compared to here theyre choosing where they want to engage blackfellas look like a scam from what i seen i did not see no productivity in there and it look like it could be flooded with trolls blacktwitter eg that is not the entire population gtthere are men who come to this sub to defend violence against black women that is an incredibly inaccurate blanket statement how is that a blanket statement when reddit is filled with black women white women lgbt community white people and trolls im not speaking just solely on reddit im speaking about society and social media gti see black men sharing content all the time again theyre choosing what they do and dont shareare you sure because shared content is going to show content based off what is trendy who you add what you participate in and your interests
53	1	youre surprised someone knew about something that was the subject of a heavily promoted netflix documentary by one of the most famous black directors ever  curious
54	1	yep
55	1	im sure sometimes it can be even more frustrating if someone in a lgtbq group says such things without realizing how badly black people who arent straight can have it things are compounded even more if not straight andor cis

60	1	huge reach boo agree to disagree and move on
61	1	gt lmao youre doing more than that youre telling women what they can and cant saythis is where i stopped because youre still reaching and not comprehendingagreeing with someone about being t i r e d of talking about black males and their issues is not the same as saying dont talk about iti said why and that we should talk about something elsesuggesting stuff has absolutely nothing to do with demanding telling and moralswe can try this again later when you can locate a dictionary
62	1	sohere is the thing all black people deal with racism the fact that black men deal with racism doesnt excuse them from being held accountable for their sexism it is extremely common for them to look at what white men have and want thatcompletely ignoring the fact that white men hold that power by oppressing everyone else it is very hard to find a black man that truly believes in equality because that means giving up power he was born into so that women can be given power that was stolen from them at birth when they expect black women to cook clean take care of children support them emotionally andor financially submit to their leadership etcjust because they were born with a penis that is sexism nobody is automatically qualified to do anything just because they were born into a specific body it is equally as wrong with sex as it is with race
63	1	oh sorry i really enjoy new york times news podcast the daily the nod codeswitch bodega boys the read radiolab and on the media on any given weekday im listening to 23 podcast episodes im actually a journalism major and thats the field im looking to get into

74	1	why do we have to let these things bother us so much though when you have selfworth you know youre beautiful important and deserving of love who cares what some black men think the majority do not hate black women it is a confirmable fact
75	1	i can understand that i cant say i have experienced it  however your pal is from atlanta and can probably pick it out much more easily than me   i believe iti think i should research the signs but part of me is frightened to because it sounds like id be at high risk of explicitly feeling it  my husband and i briefly considered moving to atlanta i could stay with the same employer and keep a san francisco salary  his position is that there are tons of well educated black women there navigating and leading in most industries here i am one of a few and hence higher profile

86	1	yep yep asking someone who is clearly not upset why they are immediately puts that person on the defensive makes them start scrambling to counteract the perception which was fabricated and they know this it is real grossedit counteract not contract
87	1	i told him it was unhealthy the first time he did it i was so frustrated with him that i started crying and thats when he finally opened up or so i thought i dont think i need to cry just for him to understand my point or the point part of me thinks he gets off on that
88	1	here is a link to a washington post article httpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewseducationwp20160211parentsoutragedafterstudentsshownwhiteguiltcartoonforblackhistorymonthutm_term7b0b971e32a2i didnt hear about the controversy of the video beforethis is a link  to the african american policy forum youtube pagehttpsyoutubeebb5tgoxgnyso probably better
89	1	im into about small steps too these just dont really seem like small steps they seem like class indicators like driving a hybrid car is great it is a class indicator using your privilege to make better choices is the bare minimum it is not deserving of a cookie and you are not better than people who didnt make that choice because they dont have the access to your choice in the first place also being vegan is hard it is crazy to me that they will go to that length to make the world better but they cant do far easier shit like mentor a student or write to their city council or help out with community gardens or even volunteer at an animal shelterit is a class indicator
90	1	i oftentimes get hit on in my college libraries with headphones and a stank face on even during finals

93	1	yep his tv show makes it very clear he hates women in general and black women especially
94	1	yeah i mean he sacrificed himself for his new woman and the kids but literally both of the black characters were there to be sacrificial lambs at the end of the day i just wish that toms fine ass woulda made it lol
95	1	yup this
96	1	i never said you said it was a private black community but you did say gti just feel like the reddit community is 80 or more not blackand so im reacting to that of course the reddit community is mostly not black anyone can get on here
97	1	i dont know much about bermuda other than people vacation there bankers and collie buddzhow does it compare to your time in vi
98	1	i agree with you so much that is the whole reason im pursuing a career in media im tired of the negativity and stereotypes about us all the time i feel like those portrayals have such a negative effect on the way we see our own race and how other races see us media has so many subconscious effects on society  there are so many white people who have never interacted with a black person before yet they get all their exposure to us through media the negative stereotypes they see makes them legitimately fear black people and i think that is what is causing the whole permit patty thing where white people call the cops on black people just existing also we need positivity for our own well being and happiness i feel lucky that i grew up exposed to successful and ambitious black parents and peers who were able to climb to the top despite their race but i realize that i am lucky not every black child has has access to role models that can show them what is possible  this is why media is so important there are so many prosperous black people in our community who are doing amazing things yet the media only wants to show that hardships and stereotypes
99	1	to answer your question im not curious because i know how and why it happens even if i dont like it im not any more curious about her choices than the men and women i know who are still friends with rapists cheaters spouse abusers and harassers her being friends with him isnt exceptional even if it does involve more power and higher social status and thank you

101	1	that is crazy i remember when i got my teeth pulled my ortho gave me so many pills like a totally unnecessary amount i remember thinking idk to think of him as good for recognizing that i would feel pain or bad for prescribing so man pills lol
102	1	that is kind of what i was thinking i work in a field where i see a lot of addiction and im sure if i was a doctor i would be super hesitant to prescribe strong drugs to anyone i wouldnt want to contribute to the crisis in any way but im not a doctor so i think it is hard to know for sure

108	1	im sorry but the presence of a man doesnt really impact how much fun i have with myself and with my friends i think the question what do you love about being single is interesting because i read it as what do i love about myself and about all the things i do that doesnt revolve a so which is a lot   also you forget to mention that there is stuff you can do single that would be difficult to do in relationship there is stuff to do with multiple friends that you cant do alone the presence of more stuff doesnt mean that that is better the quality of time and your happiness with yourself and what is around you is the ultimate goal imo    you spent more time looking for a relationship than a career or school whyyy at the end of the day everyone needs to make sure they are financially self sufficient and can fend for themselves in case anything happens i dont know i dont think that choice was wise but im sorry that getting a relationship is hard work and im not meaning to dismiss how much you value it or invalidate your experiences but a man or another person cannot and willnot make you happy that comes from within and is boosted by friendship experiences safety security and love
109	1	how soon is now almost made my list i cut it down to 5 though jojo is bizarre adventure is popular i might have to watch it

111	1	he has a baby face and i cant get into that
112	1	no worries i think that is our cue to leave this post lol
113	1	i was also programmed not to cry to the point where i dont even cry when it is necessary or justified because i dont want to seem immature every time i cried my situation got worse as well gt  yet all the pretty white girls got heaps of love and empathy from all even in the smallest situations like not getting an a in a class im thinking maybe it is more because she was pretty than because she was white i dont doubt that a minority crying would get less attention than a white girl crying but judging by how you described your family situation i think girls that cry to get their way are girls that hit the jackpot lookswise andor personality wise so they easily attract many people to them and soon they start to realize why they use their godgiven weapons to their advantage along with the emotional intelligence they developed to get their way they are raised around too many yes men including their family and friends so it is always their way or the highway it is not hard to learn to be manipulative in a situation like theirs god forbid if i ever tried this tactic i would crash hard but that is because im not an attractive white girl let alone girl madeline persch is obviously very attractive to many as she got casted by a big tv network that has a reputation of prioritizing looks over talent however im not saying shes necessarily talentless either but she was cast as a sexualized bombshell redhead in riverdale for a reason people forget that lookism is actually prevalent in every corner of society ampx200b

139	1	trumpism is about destruction not education or building
140	1	im a transplant and would love such a tour  can i hop on the bandwagon please
141	1	youre not completely off base black women are the group of hetero women who have to deal with the hetero men who most frequently date outside their race and honestly who tend to be the most vocal about it we also have to deal with very visible interracial relationships just by the nature of black fame and the way black men tend to dominate high profile careers unlike other groups even if they are marrying outside of their racedoes that make it their fault i wouldnt say that but we do have a very specific set of challenges to deal with as we mature as women and find our place in a world that judges women based on their relationships with men
142	1	i like your answer too the reasons i said black women dominates httpblackdemographicscompopulationblackwomenstatisticsaccording to the us bureau of justice statistics bjs in 2013 black males accounted for 37 of the total male prison population white males 32 and hispanic males 22 white females comprised 49 of the prison population in comparison to black females who accounted for 22 of the female population httpswwwgooglecomampsampcnncomcnn20170307politicsblackswrongfulconvictionsstudyindexhtmleven if all the black men went to school and had it together the numbers still wouldnt be high excluding prisonjailwrongfully convicted scenarios

148	1	if they have pr teams worth their weight in gold it should be no problem but even the potus team doesnt have a perfect track record so yeah id be worried if i were them
149	1	well that is sorta rude im just giving my 2 cents from what ive observed and read about this whole situation like i said some of us are allowing it in certain situations and you refusing to acknowledge that there are women who encourage this sort of behavior which is becoming a trend if you cant see that or have a normal conversation on that in expressing your views than ill be out your post black women refuse to believe we have anything to do with men behavior but yet see different articles posts hate messages etc of all ethnicities bashing black men and dont worry its vice versa but from my studies and interviewing men 80 agreed something needs to be done as you put it the minute i even mention or any other female mention what is the next best thing for women which is simply avoid these men and your lives would be better we are crazy toxic etc have a nice day i hope a man does not pray on you
150	1	exactly thats why its so annoying its patently false 910 times
151	1	this sums it up perfectly i have to remember and borrow your wording in future for when people rightly criticize members of an oppressed group for doing the wrong thing i feel like this comes up all the time with white women too and is either used as an excuse why they should have their wrongdoing ignoredbe let off the hook or a way of denying their oppression black women have my admiration for pointing this out and not doing hierarchytolerating bullying even if they wouldnt have the systemic power to do much damage we are all a little anti semitic just from living in the world
152	1	yikesssssss if changing jobs and careers is a viable option then i suggest doing so working for that person would make my mental health go in a frenzy or whatever but if not good vibes to you love you the mvp cuz eventually i would curse her out or quit im sorry you gotta deal with that nonsense stay strong

175	1	nothing they just kind of shrugged their shoulders  my mom knew folks with stables and arranged for me to hang out and sometimes ride ponies the stables were only a couple miles away
176	1	i find this invocation of kink to shut down discourse ridiculous just because it is a kink doesnt mean it shouldnt be interrogated and especially by the holders of said kink it is so funny how folks with the more harmless types are so open to discuss the origins of their kink it is always the ones who get off on harm that scream kink shaming to evade introspection or criticism
177	1	omggggg i know who op is they followed me here from a different sub after they whined about being paid less than commerce grads different account same user not a black lady at all by the way yesterday they commented on an old post i made here about me being discriminatory for wanting to hire black folks lol

180	1	it seems like an oasis in the desert everywhere else is dry and flaky from lack of lotion
181	1	they always jump on black women especially mglln
182	1	thats true you probably are scarred from that because when you were in the early stages of development it was whites that tried to tear you down therefore your more distant from whites because of your past and them not accepting you same with me im more distant from blacks its not really race its just your going to be wary of those that have hurt you the most im definitely not an advocate for whites their assholes too but i associate most of the fucked up things that fucked me up for a long time with black people i guess theirs some psychology that plays a role in that
183	1	i met my husband at a vegetarian potluck with no intention of dating as i was just out of a longterm relationship and in the midst of selling our house i was definitely not looking at the time and neither was he so we became really good friends once we were both in a space where we wanted to date i suggested we go out that was in 2006ampx200b

196	1	i dont know unfortunately he went to visit grandmas home town and decided to move  when i visited i think i may have bumped into a long lost uncle in the airport
197	1	i considered that but i decided to post anyway since i felt it would likely be a black man  the fact that another black person is treating hisher own people this way is part of the problem
198	1	cerave on the face is everrything especially in winter i still layer a sheer spf over it and my face feels supple all day never oily i think the eye cream is pretty good for maintenance too

202	1	i keep seeing people mention it which is funny because ever since i was a kid ive noticed that people dance off beat in movies it is likely that they add the music in production however since this is a jordan peele movie perhaps it has a different meaning

206	1	youre not lying it is insane how oblivious the white people are that ive met there it was weird to go to so many areas and not see any shade of brown in some of the smaller town townships that arent that far from camden  i also became skeptical quite quickly when people i met bragged about their schools being the best but it seemed like a good chunk most maybe the money only went to schools full of white people with more moneyit is actually been really hard getting closer to my so is family because they dont realize their biases at all they constantly talk about certain types of white people without realizing theyre literally the same type just not as extreme
207	1	yes i agree for some reason having to get permission from the government to change my relationship status doesnt feel right for me it is weird though because im not as bothered by having the government in my finances or health records im not antigovernmentinmybusiness except with a few  areas of my life edit i should say im not antigovernmentinmybusiness in concept in practice im very anti the way the us government uses my life circumstances and information  to further exploit me

215	1	if she is having surgery for a postpartum hemorrhage it is usually caused by a tear in the uterus or cervix  she may need an emergency hysterectomy if other surgical repair methods are ineffective but a majority of women recover well postop
216	1	after all the poster got this off in unpopular opinion wouldnt that be the perfect cover to drop some antipc tirades and get feedback trying to protect our dignity in a place like that is like trying to eradicate roaches in the south
217	1	even on a place like rgetmotivated people will say dumb shit
218	1	i totally read that wrong
219	1	yeah i love prudence in the chilling adventures of sabrina
220	1	ah yes a lot of short men have a height complex which is a huge turn off especially because im taller than average the ones that dont give a shit ooze confidence which is so sexy
221	1	okay i like your answer precise and nice definitely know it shouldnt center them my reasons to ask like i stated to another member there are white feminist who takes in men and it just builds their group stronger i cant say for black women i have no knowledge or the proper wordsterms to use to start a little study on my own as far as the negative objectives you stated abuse violence etc do you see yourself supporting black men who never done any of those things from what i gather in a male group on facebook men dont want to support the group addressing hypermasculinity because they feel like they shouldnt be grouped with the rest as far as health problems and relationship challenges im noticing a trend of decent black men who are trying to get the word out to have a quality live spand but isnt a trend as feminism of all sorts theres men that are creating webinars books groups the whole 9 but it just isnt enough of them mostly because a lot arent aware and you wanna know who are mostly in these groups women the number of women who support black men trying to reach out others are high but still low at the same time and for the men well theyre not even exposed to it enough or know it even exist i had to direct a few guys who were also decent on facebook and twitter bc they didnt even know these groups existed from my understanding these small groups want to be helped or help black men but strongly suggest having a woman to support them as they grow through certain obstacles not saying to take away feminism but to add or coparent especially with the good groups
222	1	to me its the fact that the person came to a black space and asked for permission like one small subset of black périple saying yay or nay would be seen the act not problematicthe other one was a video with no real context and like idk to me if someones going to go through all that trouble to emulate us would i associate with them no but whateveras other commenters here have said she can and will do what she wants why come around here asking for black approval on something they already know is bs or they wouldnt be asking in both cases i cant be bothered if people want to trash their hair to be like us thats whatever my opinion isnt going to stop them
223	1	not aware of such a difference
224	1	side note pepper spray in eggs is actually a thing
225	1	lmao i dont hate bey but i agree that she is not genuine or original she hops on trends and people give her credit for doing it just because she is beyoncé and she did do the members of dc wrong my mom thinks she kicked  out farrah from the group because she was prettier lol

227	1	gt and we cant discuss that period without mentioning the tuskegee airmen who were some of the greatest pilots of world war ii after the war not one of them was even permitted to apply for a job with a commercial airline  not one1httpswwwchicagotribunecomnewsopinioncommentaryctperspecnationalanthemblackmen20171012storyhtmlyou talking about grandpa reminds of this excerpt from eugene morris oped it hit me hard the disrespect your grandpa is generation did it all and still returned to a big ole slap in the face ugh
228	1	id say if its that toxic then its time to move on
229	1	yeah it was so great everything about that was perfect
230	1	i do this a a lot but its because im not the best at making friends
231	1	but youre blowing the excess out of proportion i mean just having a big building is a crime people were literally worried about that that is what im referring to
232	1	yes no random light skinned kid with light eyes that makes you wonder if mom stepped out and they just dont talk about it
233	1	im already a podcast junkie but the content i prefer true crime and scary ghost stories seems a bit much for 7 am lol i decided on a selfhelp audiobook called captivate it is pretty light and ive already put some of this morning is tips on being more charming to use at work
234	1	well yeah she might consider you her enemy it wouldve worked like that toobut person above meant she is not your friend not your ally eventhough she is black too
235	1	oh lord good on you for being able to handle that i cant imagine its easy working in that industry in portland as a black woman i still cant decide if i prefer portlands casual racism or blatant racism
236	1	i hope she saw the error of her ways  those type of people rarely do  glad you came to your senses  let your black excellence shine
237	1	i dont think ill be able to
238	1	i still dont see how a nobody use it solution is being discouraged they favor the word being objectively offensive wrong in all situations instead of subjectively offensive which requires people to consider context who use it was there a hard er etc
239	1	gtim not im actually giving gray and a lot of pastors the benefit of the doubt especially since i know what can and does go on in that worldhow is bashing christianity and disagreeing when people say not all pastors are like him giving them the benefit of the doubt how is bashing all megachurches giving them the benefit of the doubt you already made a snap judgment about him and his lifestyle and even brought up his relationship with his wife it may be justified but dont say youre giving him the benefit of the doubt youre not neutral and youre not putting him or the church in a good light either youre just assuming the worst of not only him but other pastors gtbut it doesnt go both ways they made a choice to be leaders not the average christian if anything im underrepresenting the greed of the church there is a lot more that needs to be cleaned up and john gray is just the beginningthe average christian still has a moral duty to respect his leader it is not like you can just sit at home and play the xbox 360 all day that is not how it works you need to clean up your own life before you start being hyperjudgemental of others yes greed is a problem in the church but you make it seem as if all churches are the same and think anyone that doesnt 100 agree with you is minimizing the problem in the church again that is not giving pastors like him the benefit of the doubt especially when you were so worried about his congregation when youre not a part of itgtplease show me which verses i took out of context or where i said anyone cant have jewelry or a carhow about every verse you stated that has to do with riches you know what verses im speaking about i also stated that it is okay if a pastor rolls up in a benz and you were so defiant about that and even stated or implied that a pastor has to eschew worldly riches to be a proper leader and servant of god which includes jewelry and a car not to mention you even said that it is okay for a poor or average person to have those things because they didnt make a vow to god even though those vows to god dont always include a vow of poverty and that is okaygta lamborghini isnt a 500 ring it is such an extravagant purchase that it is a big enough incident to be a problem on its own scale matters and you seem to want to ignore thati am absolutely not okay with that but the church is not some evil place and it is one incident just one you cant judge the good he is doing based on one incident scale does matter but so does the logistics of this situation youre telling me that the kingdom he is worked to build is all falling to pieces all because of this one incident youre being dramatic it just means he needs to reflect more with god well see if he changes if he continues down this path but i wouldnt lose sleep over this like you probably are because youre scared the church will become like white evangelicalism gtim honestly probably giving him too much room and am probably more aware of the limits of the internet in relation to changing the church than you are and that is where youre wrong youve been defensive this entire time and havent even considered the sides of other people including the other op that recently replied to you you dont seem to be giving him a lot of room you admitted you hold him to an extremely high standard how is that a lot of room if you were aware of the limits of changing the church through the internet especially more than i am then maybe you shouldnt try to faultily overcompensate for everything and drag christianity down with him your replies have honestly been condescending because you sound as if you believe youre one of few christians with the right answers and the best interpretation of the bible newsflash youre not gti dont dabble in not all christians excuses and have no shame in holding leaders to higher standards if you do that is for you to deal withno one here has shame youre just making assumptions not all christians is not an excuse you can work to change the church and recognize not all christians are like that not all christians is to assauge the worries of believers and non believers especially those who are interested in developing a relationship with christ if you make generalizations which you seem to want to do based on your rhetoric that will only hinder the mission of the gospel on earth no one is saying we need to hide what the john grays of the world are doing but if you can overcompensate on reddit for what he is doing then so can other christians by saying not all christians people are not smart enough to know that not all christians are the samegtand i question why you keep trying to minimize clearly extreme purchases as if theyre your average jewelry or car but i think you need to keep the conversation muddy to avoid making an honest critique of pastoral behaviorive had these conversations with pastors who live decent lives they arent complicatedbecause you literally said that it is okay for a poor person to have jewelry and a car because they didnt make a vow to god showing you were obviously misinformed about what a pastor is vow to god entails  i am not trying to muddy the waters i have criticized his behavior here too but you havent noticed or said anything about that
240	1	big facts im tired of our frustrations always being brushed off and just being told to get over things or ignore them because reasons we get shitted on a lot and somehow were supposed to just take it and never say anything about it so as not to offend anyone else but were not worth getting the same respect
241	1	i thought they were 0 interest
242	1	if you are white why did you prefer using aa vs black just call people what they prefer
243	1	its ok i wouldnt make the decision to turn it on but if it comes on the radio i probably wouldnt change the station except for that i like it song i hate that song
244	1	yeah okay and i hope youre actually helping the church rather than sitting on your high horse and pointing fingers good you admitted why youre not one you also know it is not easy to be a pastor you also clearly showed you werent fit to be one when you misrepresented the vows that a pastor should make to god under the guise of false dichotomies gti hope you have a good day in the literal sensegood girl and then youll reply to me again and say it for the fifth time too predictable
245	1	they taste better the old school way but i prefer the texture of them when they are sauteed
246	1	eh i just dont see it i dont find her cute or charming i hear that a lot though

248	1	i actually liked the stud cause it was more discreet i think its just a matter of getting used to a big ole hoop in my nose
249	1	i feel like youve completely romanticized history into something it never actually was
250	1	i dont rhink it is reaching at all so should all men assume that a woman showing cleavage is looking for a relationship
251	1	basically if punching down is the only way you can tell jokes youre in the wrong line of work it doesnt make you edgy
252	1	i recommend going to the rherpes subreddit that have a lot of information also if you get the swab test on the lesions that is the most active test to get dont wait to do it the antibody test is really accurate but itll only catch the virus after antibodies are built in your body which i believe takes 12 weeks ask the doctor if heshe can tell you if it is ghsv1 or hsv2 if it is hsv1 youll probably only have one primary outbreak it sheds 1 of the time and it is highly unlikely that you can pass that strain on genitally to others
253	1	yeah were happy the whole family is dark sis its just the whole mother stepped out on the marriage bit that people are taking issue with
254	1	the older generation yes it is not uncommon to see older black couples the younger generation not so much you have to remember some of these neighborhoods that were predominantly black in the past have changed or are changing for example compton isnt majority black anymore it is majority mexicanlatino  i grew up in south central and lived in inglewood for a couple years
255	1	because the wypipo in rconfessions loved it and she thought we would too
256	1	eastern asians especially seem very passive in their fight for fair treatment for some reason they appeared to stop fighting after the yellow peril im an outsider but it would benefit them to focus more on the poverty rates in the asian american community and to disprove that not every asian has to or is a model minority also they should use the civil rights movement as inspiration for their own movements and not to simply ride off it andor be divisive against other minorities
257	1	it seriously works i used to be obsessed with kdramas when i was a teen i havent watched one in years but to this day i recognize when people are speaking korean even though i cant understand a word of it

259	1	goals but damn the cost of living
260	1	ok i read what you wrote and i disagree youre oversimplifying how much bullshit people deal with in the real world you dont feel a need for safer spaces in your life that is fine but dont assert that nobody needs them and that the solution to the problem is better coping mechanisms that is lowkey victim blamingampx200bgtif she wants to make sure everyone is on the same page she should just hire some moderators for the forum which any forum administrator should do anyway and she shouldhire moderators for a web forum most of the people i know who moderate web forums do it for free and yes anyone has the opportunity to troll the forum but like you said itwhat she is requiringis a lot of effort for someone to go throughampx200byoure missing the point though as i read the description she is not doing this to make sure everyone is on the same page as much as she is doing it to make sure the members of the group are members of her target demographic ampx200bgta light skinned woman can offer valuable experience about their own privilege dark skinned women only see from the outside looking in but you dont always get to hear from light skinned women that are aware of their own privilege again youre totally missing the point this is not a let ls women talk about their privilege space therefore nobody wants to hear it and i can understand why people in an affirming and safer space that is centered around ds women dont want the space centered around the privilegeexperiences of ls women ampx200bgtyes not everyone is the same skin color but darkness or blackness has absolutely nothing to do with your mindset at all the sooner people like us realize that the betteri understand this and i suspect the women in the forum do as well but as i said earlier we dont live in an ideal world and the  isolutions you proposed completely ignore the fact that colorism exists and that it has both psychological as well as physical effects people need intentional spaces to heal from the trauma you might not need it but i dont understand why it is so hard for you to understandacknowledge why someone else might im going to invite you to take a minute to reflect on what i and others have said here

269	1	long ago the mod team proposed this to the user base and people overwhelmingly said they did not want to go private basically the user base i was a user and not a mod at the time felt that it would be hiding and would make it that much harder for other black women to find a safe place around the same time a private coed sub was founded with black fellas i believe it is dead i didnt even bother to join on this account i personally feel like it is worth revisiting
270	1	the black men making excuses for her on twitter has me lost i couldnt date a woman like that and i know she is still making snide comments
271	1	oh man you really are going through it  im going to light a candle for you today and think of you whenever i look at it  it is my way of calling on the universe to send strength and peace and good fortune to someone  i wouldnt blame you if you were thinking woman what the hell is that going to do for me  but im gonna do it anyway
272	1	how is a dude who buys the services of a child sex worker not an abuser
273	1	it is the sad truth
274	1	exactly like this woman was talking about intersectionality before people cared about intersectionality
275	1	thanks
276	1	thank you
277	1	thank you and that would be great ill let you know
278	1	thanks for the link but this addresses her first statement theres no coverage about the recent apology i do agree though this link doesnt let her off
279	1	can you give me an example im not looking for any trouble lol
280	1	i can relate to being in an all white environment  i grew up in connecticut and was the only back girl in my class and i always felt i was the ugly one compared to all my friends  i had one boyfriend prior to attending college and i always was the one to field questions and heard hey lehmongeloh your friend is really cute is she single  it really fucked me up and i internalized it a lot and wished i was white there was a lot of black girls ugly because of racism happening in my townit took me forever to overcome a lot of those negative internalized views and even longer for me to also be comfortable with my natural hair because it went from well im confident and awesome but have straight hair because people wont find me attractive with natural hair to i am confident and awesome with natural hair and i dont need anyone to tell me that im attractive because i already know that  i think it would have helped to  have positive black girls my age growing up  i mean my parents told me i was beautiful all the time but as a kid youre not going to believe your mom and dad
281	1	this right here
282	1	the messed up thing is i have nonlatex condoms but i only brought one and the rest of our encounters were with his trojans or whatever
283	1	its genetic throwbacks happens within my family too
284	1	where is this post of yours i want to see the comments
285	1	yes its so ridiculous how they were trying to silence the supposedly nonexistent according to them black female  nerds
286	1	no im getting tired of pokemon and i still havent finished ultra sun i was going to get breath of the wild and octopath
287	1	the point of being a comedian is to make people laugh and earn a living off of it hart makes millions laugh and gets paid millions for it he is good at comedy arguing that fact is disingenuous because your personal opinion isnt some universal success barometer
288	1	yup totally agree
289	1	omggggggthanks for the summary youre better than me this is the most absurd thing ive read and how could anyone come for cynthia erivo and her angelic voice smh some of these youtubers are not okay mentallyon another note i dont know anyone white people who watch insecureis it that popular among white ppl
290	1	do it please
291	1	yep ive luckily found some really great people but when i was a kid sports were so awful for me its like people who hate children and minorities exclusively sign up to work with them or something so bizarre
292	1	its a stretch but the episode is about that
293	1	it was so rewarding thanks happy solstice
294	1	from my observations the demographic of that sub reddit is primarily white the black people who post are usually trolling with a self hate rant
295	1	i completely agree lol nothing else even came close for me
296	1	im honestly not sure ive been subscribed to subs in the past and have been kept in when theyve gone private but ive also heard of people getting kicked out i would think there is a way to restrict it to only approved submitters
297	1	im 25 so a nontrad i was actually working towards med school in undergrad and applied where i could but got tired of the rejection lack of security and time sacrifice so i stopped im in grad school now and no longer feel like i have to do medicine that being said im increasingly toying with the idea of giving it one decent shot even if it is to just give myself closure im concerned ill regret it later on if i dont at least tryim curious now too how old are you
298	1	yeah im having a hard time with this one just based off of her choice of major i feel like art degrees are for people with connections and fuck  you money which the vast majority of black women are not
299	1	why is she so mad halfrican
300	1	gt sometimes i will be in my yard gardening checking the mailbox or just chillin and white people literally slow down in their cars to look at mewow
301	1	and he even cites milo yiannopoulos poster boy of white creepy men the topic defintely belongs in runpopularopinion along with all the other really popular racistmisogynisticplain stupid unpopular opinions exspressed by the same really plain white boys that are very opinionated on shit that has nothing to do with them
302	1	baggy androgynous clothing i notice that she seems to be getting typecast and shown in a certain way in every movie she is in the most feminine ive seen her was in black panther and even then she was still one of the warriors fighting i disliked that movie for that reason its like its impossible for directors to show darker skinned black women in a feminine way the way they show other races of women
303	1	who
304	1	yay that podcast is one of the best dramatic podcasts ive ever listened to i swear i audibly gasped at some point on nearly every episode so well done the cast is flawless and the story is sooooo good it also stays with you it was a few months when i last listened to it and i still wonderenjoy it
305	1	she is been here for a while she is a kid and english isnt her first language
306	1	right now ive made some cute ornaments im okay at using clay im gonna try making tshirts for my sons birthday very soon im open to anything but id love to learn to sew too
307	1	this made me feel a bit better ill try to reclaim my time on monday
308	1	time will rehabilitate his image the newspapers tend to write about former presidents wearing rosetinted glassesthere is also a subset of people who want to see a principled republican party and outside of reagan who other than dub bush is that guy you dont need her excellency to give him a public makeoverthe silver lining is michelle is public evolution in 2007 they said all manner of terrible things about her look at her now she is soaring and i am totally here for it
309	1	which citystate do you work in thats a nice comeup
310	1	and on the bonestears of natives
311	1	thats what im trying to figure out im trying to be in as little debt as possible after school because ill be headed to law school which has me leaning towards howard but i hear the experience and opportunities at spelman are insane
312	1	there are blasian people and they cant be blamed there are a couple subreddits with names that are innocuous or in one case rather empowering it is like those messianic synagogues really run by evangelist christians and pregnancy counselling clinics run by antiabortionists our automatic ban notification informs people and many people realize it and cooperate but some people dont there is no real winning here only stemming the damageand unfortunately there are some lonely and hurt people that fall into the cult weve seen them spread the incel gospel here before and it is not enough and it is unfair to make the community let itself be infested to help deprogram these individual people it is a great community dont get me wrong but no one comes here to do that kind of work
313	1	sounds like she wants to see how kinky your hair maybe and not for good reasons
314	1	i loved pepper ann and her theme song shes like one in a million
315	1	youre welcome
316	1	racists dont respond to proof or evidence though i read these studies as not so much as we needed a study to know this fact but more being able to put a number to just how pervasive it is
317	1	so you dont worn them now
318	1	as an asian woman i agree with that second sentence it is sad but asian men do deal with a lot of pressure to stay within their race when it comes to dating and marriage speaking from personal experience with my brothers and also from level headed discussions with other asian men online
319	1	i think the hosts do a good job with the story the information they present is balanced and do not paint them the moms in any sympathetic light at least in my opinion the storytelling is highly critical of the mothers motivation in adopting the kidswhat made me even angrier was learning devonte boy in the photo and his biosiblings had an aunt who loved them was happy raising them and fought hard for them only for the system to hand them over to two monsters
320	1	we can contemplate theory all day but the reality is that if you want to make a decent income after you graduate you do need skills and training that are in demand capitalism isnt going anywhere and black folks need to play the game wisely if they want any type of generational wealth im not saying it is right it is what it is
321	1	came here to say this
322	1	im so lost where does the white supremacy come in
323	1	lmao
324	1	my main outlet for it is shadowrun anarchy all the fun lore of the shadowrun series but with none of the wading through rules and stats the book could be better written but fans of the system often pull bits of it apart and remix it it is called anarchy for a reasonthere is also axon punk a recent indie rpg with the intent of blending cyberpunk with hip hop the writers describe it as ghost in the shellmeets samurai champloo which is pretty accurate theyre slow tro publish new content but the basic rulebook is totally playableon the urban fantasy side of things im fascinated by city of mist they describe it as a superhero noir  ordinary people blessed with the powers of figures from myth and legend solving mysteries in the city and their own dual nature the rulebook is very large but theyre about to release a new version that splits it in two similar to dampd is player is handbook and dungeon master is guide genuinely changed my approach to writing mysteries in games
325	1	omg this statement hurts more with your naija flair lmaoim so shocked
326	1	the lesbian subreddits r awful so so white and transphobic
327	1	how is that an apology all he said is he wouldnt say it now because people are sensitive
328	1	same edit never been a fan
329	1	i forgot about that statue i saw it in a documentary and cant understand why thats even there
330	1	because they dont want to admit that they were attracted but too racist or invested in other guys opinions to say anything they dont want to admit they made a choice they knew was wrong
331	1	gthowever they are people and they should be allowed to make mistakes provided that they repent for them and undergo the necessary consequences this is where i think most people is criticisms are coming from not expecting him to be perfect or superior he is already gotten up and defended the purchase and i think it is a little disingenuous to try to shift the burden of the issue onto people who treat pastors like gods or derail the conversation into discussing small church finance that is not what is going on here at all
332	1	challenged hmm im honestly stumped on that one ill let my thoughts run wild in my journal later onim really trying to think are there other artists who have raised concerns about socalled political correctness musicians have the labels to contend with actors are essentially employees of the production writers like musicians submit their work and editors determine what gets publishedcomedians might in fact be the rare artists who can put their material out as is with very little interference they write their jokes hone them and sooner or later you see the special or they come to a comedy club near youi guess it makes sense that comedians are the main ones you hear objecting to political correctness at the same time eh this was an incomplete thoughtif someone says stop making fun of me  around the office or using slurs it would be mad disrespectful if the request falls on deaf earsedit actually i know what i was saying comedians are moreless expected to dig into the common taboos for humor is sake i wouldnt expect the same from singers but they sure can if they so desire
333	1	they play the race card when it comes to other issues too  it is not just this people only really see the reality when the issues affect them  there many other times when black people bring up the race card and it has no bearing
334	1	again why are you so angry and was my comment that serious that you really had to stalk my post history
335	1	i get why there are downvotes but as a rule i dont downvote genuine discussionquite a few say if only we would stop using the word the foolishness about why cant we say it will stop and i say that misses the pointthe problem is less the words and more about racism there is a wholeass sub on here where people rock out in virtual blackface and mock us it is deeper than i just want to sing along to the song
336	1	saw your edit heavens no wealth is not a reflection of your morals intelligence or work ethic for every company that ipos there is a graveyard full of others who met an unfortunate death due to luck timing saturation and a whole host of other factorsi see your point on the relative struggle ive met a few people who vacation in the hamptons or fly to bermuda which i can see why a doctor is kid who is living fine would be like wtf lol50000 as the median that scares me i hope i never go to a hospital without insurance you could buy an entry level mercerdes benz
337	1	awh thanks grim
338	1	pillowfort and sharesome seem to be good options at the moment there is this one post talking about the owner of sharesome that is kind of an interesting readhttpwinneganfaketumblrcompost180842629953hrefnatheravenqueenmindbodydickotomy
339	1	really ive always had an easy time finding other black nerds irl
340	1	your presence makes me uncomfortable
341	1	ill fix that
342	1	oh my bad sorry about that
343	1	i mod bpt and for some reason they think all the mods there are white and racist and call me a field nigga because i point out that they are wrong
344	1	never i dont think it is as bad as dollar but this is how a creflo gets startedpeople being unwilling to critique him because intent or why cant a pastor have nice things
345	1	youre right
346	1	i have seen this all over twitter    but the reality is it is because of the how the trailer is cut  the song is synced to the flow in the trailer not the actual movie
347	1	when did the op mention that her friend was afraid to meet up with the guy or that it was a date she said her friend met him once and he was nice thats all she said just because you ask a friend to accompany you on a social outing doesnt mean you are afraid of the person you are meeting ive asked friends to come with me plenty of times when i was meeting another person and not once was it because i was afraidthe friend couldve wanted the op to meet the guy so she could tell her what she thought maybe it was more of a social outing than a date maybe they were going to hang out with the guy for a bit then go off and do their own thing ive invited friends along with me to meet guys for all of those reasons
348	1	man at first i was thinking damn calm down pops then i realized wait thats exactly what i do when im happy about my baby lol
349	1	frfr though bagel bites to snack on before the main meal is not a bad idea
350	1	gt point our voice is heard louder than other political group i cant say who associates themselves with blm but even that group is spoken by womenblm didnt come out of nowhere just like any online group black women made a decision to put in the work and start it a group that largely benefits black men black men can do the same there are plenty of them out here  gtum no im getting responses that dont line up to what im questioning im getting responses and statistics on women i know that the convo is to acknowledge if men should be included or not and how theres not enough of them for their voices to heardthat is because youre on a sub that centers black women youre being told that your question doesnt line up with the way and place youre asking it again though there are plenty of black men them not being engaged in social causes isnt the same thing as them not existing they get heard plenty in sports and entertainment they can do the same in those places and anywhere else gtthey already did i gave you examples and findings already of what theyre doing that youre probably aware of yourself it is just not enough of themlike i mentioned before just like black women there are plenty and theyre active in spaces online and in real life where they want to be active if theyre choosing not to be involved in groups and efforts that support and center them they have work to dogtblackfellas look like a scam from what i seen i did not see no productivity in there and it look like it could be flooded with trolls blacktwitter eg that is not the entire populationim not a fan of that sub but there are plenty of real black men there probably more than there are black women here it is real even if you dont like what you see gthow is that a blanket statement when reddit is filled with black women white women lgbt community white people and trolls im not speaking just solely on reddit im speaking about society and social mediaall those places have black men too and they arent blanket supportive of black women gtare you sure because shared content is going to show content based off what is trendy who you add what you participate in and your interestswhat of course i follow actual black men and have black men i know online and in real life i see them share and create content all the time regardless of algorithms theyre doing what they want to do
351	1	oh alright fuck it ill still be mad at the joke thanks for the explanation his standup was so lackluster that i forgot
352	1	thank you it wasnt actually easy to find one with all the little things i wanted but i had a great consultant that listened to me at the last salon and she pulled this out of the back
353	1	yes i dont meet too many people who watch documentaries use netflix or think of it

355	1	my first reaction was hopeful that he did not do it but afraid that he might have after reading his statement i dont even feel comfortable trying to give him the he is socially awkward he didnt mean it like that passany normal person would feel hurt at being accused of such horrible things so i get his angerdisbelief but mocking one of the accusers for being into new age crystal shit and implying that she is therefore too looney to be believed is bullshit while in the same post claimed the reason why he got way too touchy with another accuser was he was using a native american technique to feel her spirit energy lol wtfit is bullshit i loved ndt but this is bullshit he didnt have to disrespect or belittle the accusers in his statement to get his innocence across which in my opinion he failed to do
356	1	yes im all about having skin in the game i work in community development and there is a huge difference between how black people who love in the city advocate versus hope black people who move to the suburbs advocate and the latter dont realize how out of touch they are
357	1	i used to do apple cider vinegar drinks it is an acquired taste
358	1	same i cured my social anxietyboosted my self confidence through the ceiling via that book and pride myself on being able to find common ground with just about anyone now it is a timeless read
359	1	i have found my people
360	1	gt but i know it is the worst thing you can do to question someone is parentingthe best thing one can do is to question someone is parenting literally lives are on the line
361	1	amen
362	1	yep i was in almost all of themi got banished from fb cuz i was in a very popular proback community and got dragged i refuse to go on such of those groups and face my former counterparts again
363	1	wait what im saying that a black trump supporter in my eyes is allowed to think how they want even if i dont agree with them
364	1	gt if it were me i would have responded differently but i was also musing on the fact that no matter how he responded i suspect it would have been heavily scrutinized based on the fact that he is blacki feel the same way
365	1	gtsnapsplatlolololl
366	1	gtits already pretty hard to find black men who date black women but finding a black man that exclusively dates black women nearly impossible especially if you want to date a college educated black mandid you go to a hbcu the vast majority of black men at my hbcu dated black women exclusively
367	1	oh yeah black men in la do love exotic women and white women and also the black population in so cal is actually not that big when you look at it percentagewise there are way more black people in the south so if you specifically want a black man in la and he must like black women and he must check all of the other boxes you might have then your pickings are slim
368	1	yeah im in my mid 20s im sure your best friend appreciates the extra effort youre putting in to be kept in the loop i always feel so bad because im the one in our group that they actually have to text or talk to there is nothing to like favorite retweet say it to my face oh well life goes on
369	1	nothing about constantly trying to center black men in space for black women is respectful that is why youre getting the responses youre getting im not on this sub to talk about how to help black men im on this sub to talk about the issues and experiences of black women period
370	1	thank you i want to read more stuff like this going forward
371	1	thanks i really appreciate it i really mean to sound like a bitch and it is actually some that im going to be working on in the new year stop apologizing for how i feel i am getting anxiety for tomorrow morning because i have a feeling my father is going to say something smartmy family wouldnt irritate me so much if they would just leave me be but they wont so both thursday and saturday after christmas are definitely for me
372	1	it is sad tbh
373	1	well it is a heroic job when done well and i thank you for doing it  i especially admire it because kids get on my nerves in general so to want to devote your professional life to them is heroic to me  lol
374	1	everyone has their own threshold for how much or how little sex theyre having 20 times seems like a lot to me because my sex life is nil but to some that may not be a lot at all
375	1	imm be right here waiting for an answer to your question
376	1	exactly omfg they literally want you to support them in their ignorance
377	1	gtfolx is not gender neutral if it signifies only non binary gendersit doesnt only signify non binary genders it is a word to describe all genders the x is only there to raise awareness about the fact that non binary genders exist and are valid this word is in no way excluding anyone gtthe constant shaming and superiority complex is exhausting and its across the board whether it be the assertion that vegans care more about animals not just pets as nonvegans must only care about or that vegans are more enlightened  in tuned with their bodies their temples rather more healthy more civilized more conscious more cultured more eco friendly more this more that all of which is debatablethe notion that all vegans must lead healthy lifestyles is wrong i eat oreos a lot and i mean a lot a plant based diet has just been scientifically proven not debatablehttpsacademicoupcomajcnarticle8951627s4596952 to be healthier on average more vegans are healthier dont confuse that with were all health freaks and believe to be spiritually above yall not to mention that simply stating facts like these arent meant to shame or guilt trip people its meant to inform people about the good of veganismgti think of anthony bourdain someone who was white and undoubtedly loved and appreciated the historical and social implications of food and hated vegans and his israelpalestine episode when he realizes he was served an all vegan israeli meal and the cook never even mentioned the word vegan or vegetarian oncebecause pointing out the raw plant based vegan nature of her food was besides the point and yet the historical and cultural significance of her dish was deeper than whatever deep dish vegan cheese and tofurkey pizza youd find a lot of vegans lording over non vegans unenlightened headsso youre calling out white veganism i dont get it this is exactly what i despise white vegans claiming dishes that arent theirs and not understanding the culture they come from because they white wash them white veganism creates barriers against veganism it paints veganism as being inherently racist gtvegan is just another label that has been coopted as a way to get you to pay more money for food that is probably bland andor pretending to be meatyeah no being plant based and vegan is substantially cheaper i personally dont eat meat substitutes but who cares if people do they are better for the environment and at times tastier if you cook them right i incorporate my east african cuisine into a lot of my dishes gtvegan food can be just as processed and unhealthy as regular shmegular food from the corner store its just more branding its not more culturally or socially aware regardless of what gender or race you happen to beyour point being no one is claiming that vegan products like oreos or candy bars are healthy chips for example are vegan and unhealthy were out here advocating for veganism because our environment is collapsing it would allow us to feed more people around the world not all of us are vegans because its healthier thats just a plus to me as a person who is vegan out of ethical reasons being a vegan does not mean that youre automatically healthy but it is healthier to engage in a plant based diet having education about what is healthy and isnt healthy is still important it is just proven the vegans tend to know what is and what isnt now the type of veganism youre describing and annoyed about again and again is white veganism white veganism has created an image of veganism as whole foods shopping and dependent on having a large enough income to eat only expensive foods this is what im against as it isnt inclusive of everyone
378	1	yessss this is the inspiration i need in my life lol thank you
379	1	hm ok i just dont understand what other women have that i dont that has men more than willing i dont want to propose because i think thats incredibly emasculating and awkward i want him to do it because it shows that someone actually wants me after being told so many times that no one would but i am tired of waiting he said he got something really special for christmas a few minutes ago so im waiting to see if thats not it its time to reevaluate why im here
380	1	yeah another thing with long articles is that a lot of times people will open it in another tab and only actually read it days later so even if they like the article they either never upvote the reddit link or only upvote it after like a week
381	1	ah i see i mean that is understandable to feel discomfort or suspicious of the people who arent black women watching the posts here but blackladies isnt private so there will be other people looking at the posts govern yourself accordingly there is a private black group but it is pretty much dead that tends to happen with any private reddit community
382	1	gt ok so whats the problem thenif you have to ask you sound pretty dense read op is title againgtwhat im so confused so you agree that there should be an exclusive place for dark skinned women but you dont think that exclusive place should be exclusive in practice only in theory please clarifyit can still be exclusive if it is open to the public making it private doesnt make a difference this sub is exclusively for black ladies the other sub is exclusively for black men however they are not doing nonsense tests to affirm how dark you are if you feel you have to do that then you have other problems only a mentor can help you solve if she wants to attract a target demographic of dark skinned girls they will come to her and nature will take its course she doesnt need to be arbiter of whoever is dark enoughgti guess you have nothing to say i was perfectly clear here youre so obsessed with saving energy when life doesnt work like that it is not a video game where you have to save energy to get to the next level people do things they need to do to survive all the time and they are still able to do with their supposed lack of energy and they dont even complain about it even if it is justified suddenly when it comes to colorism people dont want to stand up and take action
383	1	all i can provide is anecdotal evidence so its not going to matter  ive been in my relationship with a bw for 7 years  my aunt and uncle are both black and have been married for 30 years however my mom is divorced from a bm who treated her like crap  people are either good or bad   according to statistics you can google only 13 of black people marry outside of their race  if there was such a huge epidemic of bms treating bw the way you assume they all do that percentage would be much higher  you personally may have had some bad experiences with bms but dont think for one second that all of us are the same  youre no better that white people who think blacks are all lazy and criminals
384	1	agreed
385	1	i deleted him from snapchat after he said something annoying then he texted me bye felicia
386	1	damn
387	1	i can tell from my experience that i went to one dont remember which  probably the hapa one and subbed it because  being blasian  i thought it was for us  it wasnt
388	1	i actually buy men is jeans the denizen by levi is athletic cut jeans you want athletic cuts because they are cut more generously in the hips i had the same issue and i havent had that so far with these i have wide hips too and thighs so that is an option
389	1	same same same
390	1	yes its always the girls remember when my wife and kids recast the dark skinned black daughter and replaced her with a light skinned daughter i think that was the show
391	1	i definitely let my fitness go by the wayside in 2018 here is to getting back on track f yeah business goals too
392	1	ban me i dont care that you cant read everyone knows your classic move is to not listen and when someone challenges you with facts you move to a ban to keep the conversation in your favor like i literally said the first time i agree niggas aint shit men aint shit  all of the above but if you actually took the time to read you would understand the issue was with the optics the same reason its fucking dumb for black men to run around saying black women are ugly something i acknowledged the first i posted is the same reason its fucking dumb for black women to run around saying im tired of black men shows a lack of solidarity amongst us and fuels white bullshit and is ultimately antiblack if you cant see that then just ban me because you clearly are encouraging the bullshit edit im already banned stop responding to me you all have a lot to say about me being male and finding this problematic but fail to address the fact that this thread was started by a black woman jump through a hundred hoops to justify your antiblack misandry it doesnt change the fact that this shit is a terrible look why did i make my parody post to show how this shit is dumb in reverse and how the same men you say you are tired of dont have this kind of energy for you
393	1	i only mentioned the first part cause of  amnesty internationalhttpswwwamnestyorgendocumentspol3040622016en  is obligations to respect protect and fulfill the rights of human sex workers and a person may change their language after reading that the second part was showing how that doesnt fit for brown is case and why abuser is appropriate  the third was just explaining why some people would still not say abuser despite the second partyou legit asked how and i gave an answer i never said it was right
394	1	yes his voice is sooo sexy

396	1	what is a yoni steam please
397	1	yess so important
398	1	thank you for sharing your experience things maybe different now but still anti blackness never goes away i am doing hella research on any town i plan on going to most of these towns are coastal cities near the adriatic coast or they are in the city i watch may youtube vloggers on their experiences in italy and i heard that italian men automatically assume that every black girl visiting italy is a sex worker or whatever smh i plan to hit up either italy or portugal or spain sometime in 2019 imma definitely hit you up soon with questions
399	1	yes a source would be great reputable sources only preferably scientific journal thats been peerreviewed
400	1	i hadnt heard of vanjess before this list
401	1	i had to google future is paternity situation but it says he only has 6 but it seems like all the moms are different so maybe he thinks of babies like tour stop souvenirs or somethingi wonder if his family time is like yeah kid you remind me of la now your sibling that is my atl baby someone please give these fools a pamphlet on birth control and condoms
402	1	lol i told my fiancée about this preference and she deadass told me to pack my bags and gtfo apparently i was a deprived child as i didnt have plantains until i was 25

407	1	haha yes he can be very annoyingdeceitful but the way he acts around oliver like a puppy in love i just caaaaaant im a big shipper lolol
408	1	i was thinking this but didnt wanna be the first to say it
409	1	but marriage has always been a financial arrangement i believe in its most recognizable origin it was primarily a way to manage finances between two families  it was rebranded but it still serves the same practical functions in many ways capitalist structures benefit immensely from marriage as an institution
410	1	as an example i went to atl with my exotic looking friend she is black but dont look is im carmel not even dark per day in la they flock to her we went to atl and they were on me like flies on shit i was a thick red bone she actually threw a fit in the middle of the street because they werent paying her any mind they literally had no reason to bad mouth me i was kind we started long distance so it wasnt like i was taking all his time they constantly told him he could do better but his ex literally had a minimum wage job that she had no intention of wanting to do anything different lived with her grandparents blah blah but she was white and that was aok and she was basic as plain grits he has pretty ex is she aint one literally the only issue was im black as time went on i pointed out how useless they were as well as self hating he has great friends now that also are hugely pro black and pro black women
411	1	gt like writers academics marketers political consultants who have no clue about black peoplelol this is the reason why you hire black consultants they know most of the nuances so it becomes much easier to vacuum out opinions data trends etcnote to the lurking political operatives youre shooting yourselves in the foot if you lazily research online get your behinds outside and canvass run the chitlin circuit it is not enough to hit the salon rib shack and church you need to invest leatheri hate lackluster appeals for votes
412	1	girlllll this is the truth in my case i feel like i try to find reasonably priced things to do but i still come across challenges getting people to commit my ex was in the military but it was a long distance relationship so i didnt live on base but when i would visit ill just say i def feel your sentiment but anyway i agree i see my friends spend money on so many pointless things and im just in my head likewow the concert was only 25 but you needed another purse although you have x amount of other purses etc its not my place to tell them how to spend their money though and i have to respect that its just frustrating when there are so many feasible things we can do to create memories and they choose not tothe lets hang even though im flaky people dont even get invited from me anymore i get irritated when people continuously have excuses these are also the people who get upset when you dont invite them somewhere although they had no intentions on attending even if they had been invited some of my friends make more than me and stay with excuses lol its actually ludicrous i try not to let it bother me and most days it doesnt but days like this is when it does esp since the new year is like one week away and ill be with family which is fine because my friends never want to do anything
413	1	dont talk about mama e badu like that o
414	1	im guessing that was an auto correct error and then a typo
415	1	gthey sweetie maybe just dont even post relationship pics since you always say you prefer not to talk about your relationship also maybe not the rapistjust suggestions especially since her brother is in prison for rape too but with all this social media celebs just go straight to their gramtwittersnapchat to immediately post everything they think of whereas before they needed their publicist to get out the word
416	1	i feel this deeply im dark skinned and two of my full blood older sisters are fairly light i used to try and tell them that skin color has to do with how men perceive your beauty but they werent trying to hear it or believe me this was back when i was in hs
417	1	ampx200bmoney earned isnt a barometer of skill i see how you didnt bring any examples of his growthgthart makes millions laugh and gets paid millions for it he is good at comedyhe is good at getting a reaction and maybe entertaining those are different skills again adam sandler is a garbage comedic actor i dont know his standup but worth more than hart id argue that hart is more skilled but white people like sandler so he gets more money i know guys off the street who are more skilled than hart and show progress over time but arent paid near what he isif hart is skilled that is not where his millions come from he makes his money for being the small nonthreatening darkskinned black guy with a highpitched voice who is loud and makes funny faces even dave chapelle openly pointed out the difference between what a comedian is up there doing and what an audience is responding to and ultimately paying for it is part of why he disappeared for so longnot one person here is debating kevin hart is status as a comedian or success but youre trying to argue the point of being a comedian or how much he earns the fact that youre even here trying to derail discussions around his skill and choices as a person is beyond disingenuous it is ridiculousgtthe point of being a comedian is to make people laugh and earn a living off of itcomedians get into the work for different reasons some see their purpose as social commentary or personal expression or helping people release stress sometimes through laughter or even deal with pain some even say having people laugh at other people something hart does enough of doesnt fall under comedy you might have a limited view of what comedy is but just like him getting fat paychecks that doesnt make kevin hart good at being a comedian
418	1	so can you bring up where he apologized for those comments years ago everyone is saying this but i have yet to see where he actually did thatand has he even grown in what way
419	1	a lot of comedians doing it doesnt make it okay ironic bigotry is read specifically because people dismiss it as a joke ren and stimpy isnt fun to watch when you see everyone being creeps and know the creator groomed an underage girl louis ck and his routines of trying to get laid werent just jokes when hes sexually harassing womenthe jokes in themselves are the symptom of an larger issue of people trivializing struggles marginalized people go through when you go through these tweets and see the outrage youll see most of the critics are not frothingly angry and most of the people receiving the criticism overreact like crazy matt groening did the same thing when the whole apu criticism took off the guy the original criticism came from is very calm and chill and even in his documentary outright says he has better things to worry about than a cartoon character because the documentary was about a larger topic didnt stop people from framing him as some hyper sensitive babyway to lap up blatant conservative talking points
420	1	lol why
421	1	wight people especially these soulless folks are crazynot i see shit cause i have a condition crazy but commit genocide and call it equality crazy rape children and call liberty and locker talk crazy fly in drugs from around the world just to villiafy you and destry your community crazyclose your heart to them especially their men and your life will be that much calmeri also recommend making plans to move out of this fucked up country ghana is accepting black folks back
422	1	please rephrase your first point men who experience sexual violence have not had their manhood taken
423	1	they do it to shut them up because were not toeing the line per se last i checked were not monolithic this is sad
424	1	squeals yeah kpop is awesome
425	1	it was precedence before the 90s to not prescribe narcotics outside the hospital or to terminal cancer patients cause it was very clear that they are addictive this all change when a pharmaceutical company claimed the created a slow releasing narcotic that wasnt addictive at all the pill was called oxytocin ___  there is a great frontline documentary on pbs that explains how the opioid crisis started why doctors change the way the prescribed racial disparities etc
426	1	yeah actually okcupids book on the data they found from their website literally stated that religion gets a bigger dock from men than race look at stereotypes of religious black women in particular its not hard to find you arent going to find a lot of good christian boys these days im just being honest some people need thicker skin amp to stop lying to themselves for comfort
427	1	gt that is the problem you assume he cant do both with 200k it is a lot and that is my total college tuition but you cant assume his intentions at allim not even trying to guess his intentions im evaluating his decisions as a christian leader gtif we dont judge poor people with iphones why should we judge pastors with one stop nobody is judging pastors with iphones theyre judging pastors who live or want to live like theyre rappers and sports stars also did any of these poor people make a vow to god to lead gt the church has to be beyond perfectyoure completely mischaratarizing criticisms and im starting to think it is because you know this is wrong nobody is asking him his marriage or the church to be perfect theyre asking him and the church to at least try to live up to the teachings of the man they claim to follow gtbut you dont know his intent and whether he is also helping his congregation and are only concerned about appearances when you should be concerned about both i know he is blowing at least 3k a month on an extreme luxury purchase that he could have been doing something else with regardless of his intent
428	1	they felt the trailer showed action but it really wasnt an action movie and that it was predictable now i was drinking wine in a reclining movie  chair and eating popcorn  and i thought movie had turns and twists i didnt expect  so i loved the movie
429	1	yep even learning a handcraft like sewing crocheting or weaving helps a lot with braiding patterns there are even toy looms with accompanying tutorials
430	1	yea im thinking the same i already typed my notice ill submit it on monday i dont want to be miserable in the new year
431	1	yeah i noticed the other day i was leaning toward more white male coaches after starting with almost nothing but black women and a few men and it is what you said im interested in functional strength and mobility more than aesthetics even the tips on glute building i find a little annoying because aside from one black woman i follow theyre from women who were athletes when they were young or who you can tell naturally have that shape deeper derail
432	1	i have a target story as well a few years back my mom wanted to upgrade the living room by buying a new bigger flat screen tv she saw it at target and after thinking about it for some time decided to go and buy it i went with cause i love targetwere in the electronics department and the guy working gets the tv for my mom and hes trying to ring her up the security guard is a white lady and she just happens to be hanging out talking to the electronics man also white the electronics man is having issues ringing up the tv because he cant locate the serial number my mom was wondering why that mattered and the electronics man was like oh my register is asking for it and it wont ring up without iti explained to my mom that serial numbers are found on all electronic devices because they need to match this is used in case she would buy a new xbox or something and then decide to return it but instead of the new one she put in the old one and got money back for it the store cant resell an old used xbox so they need to protect their profits the electronics man was basically like that is it and assumed correctly that ive worked retail the security guard didnt believe me i guess she was grimming me hard which had my mom on alert and my mom was like my daughter works retail and is working on her degree blah blah finally electronic man gets tv rang up and my mom purchases and we decide to see what else is at targetfor the rest of the trip that white lady followed us every where we went we would look up and there she was eyeballing us all the way until we purchased the other stuff and leftit was annoying but i will say i still love target ill be damned if i let one cranky ass white person chase me out anywhere where i live though there are 3 targets within 1015 minutes of each other so i rotate between the 3
433	1	huh where are you getting that from never had i ever said men shouldnt hold responsibility im saying they are continuing to do so bc we allow to simply just talk to them mate with them breath around them those simple things that get a male started encourages men to act stupid the mean we leave their asses alone they dont have anyone to play that mess with are you serious  no one isnt bashing women and coddling men so since they chosen to  be dumb ignorant the whole 9 youre just going to ignore the fact that theres some not even all some that entertain those toxic thoughts name calling receiving attention etc like i said ill be out this post im in the 1 area where i see fuckboys and yes they may approach me the minute they try to talk my ass gone to avoid further complications something as simple as that will ruin a man is ego which is why i said earlier either he will change naturally without a woman crying a baby involved etc or he will try it on another girl half the time white good day and before i receive any dislike theres studies on this already we are not to blame for anything bc a lot of us do not know a simple hell no from all races leave me alone will stop bullshitty screenshots like this
434	1	when i was on a road trip with my white friend who has dark brunette hair going from pueblo co to on the way to phoenix az during memorial day weekend of this year my friend and i had made a pit stop at a small town somewhere outside of santa fe nm to stop to get something to eat we had made a stop at this restaurant that was nestled in that town it was white owned but it was hella appropriated with loads of indigenous and latinx art like shit even the name of the place was seemed to be something indigenous or something in spanish anyways my friend grew up eating at that restaurant with her family her parents are originally from nm and she and her husband would also go there to eat as well whenever they are road tripping she was raving about their supposed delicious food and outstanding customer service it was until me yes her racially unambiguously black friend showed up with her and they treated the both of us very nasty and rude as i was looking around the restaurant is gift shop i was noticing all of the appropriated art work and novelties i was only waiting for my friend to get us a table or whatever after i was done lurking the gift shop i walked back over to my friend and to see if she had gotten us a table i noticed things were off between her and the hostess who was a blonde and i was confused what was going on the hostess was telling us it would take nearly two hours to get a table for us and that we couldnt even sit at the bar keep in mind they were plenty of clean open tables for the both of us to sit and not allowing us to sit at the bar was super absurd hmmmi wonder why  anyways my friend was super pissed off and as we were getting in the car to leave all the white patrons of that restaurant were staring at me all hard like i was an extra terrestrial invading earth or some shit like it was a very uncomfortable situation to be in lol it took me like ten minutes to realize what just happened and to process it all lmao my friend ended up writing bad reviews on their yelp and google pages and it was a wake up call for me like i never experienced being refuse to be sit down by a restaurant right away yo
435	1	i try
436	1	wot
437	1	pigmentedlady you should be proud when you hear a sister has made it as you say in the white mans world  that means another one of us had made it against all odds  with some effort  that can be everyones story  nothing is free though  it takes blood sweat and tears   dont you think they want us to accept defeat  they want us to say to ourselves we cant do it because  stop singing that same song and ask yourself what you can do to be as successful as possible
438	1	i definitely did especially since they had 4 kids right away and i certainly wasnt having his snotnosed kids when he kept waffling on basic life decisions like living together and marriage
439	1	ive read varying stuff about being a bw visiting in japan that you get folks attempting to rudely solicit you in public and how the fetishism can get outta handis there anything backing up that hearsay
440	1	you literally could have googled black feminism this post is disingenous at best
441	1	i was just about to comment this i always am posting on rmakeupaddiction
442	1	im ashamed that i dated a white guy like this said his ultimate sexual fantasy was to take me to plantation down in georgia and have me be his sex slave we dont talk
443	1	i feel like reddit just isnt the place for people extremely bothered by this there is nothing you can really do to stop it even private subs would likely be watched by admins or fall into other hands eventually anyhow i got control of a private sub i wasnt subscribed too a couple months ago
444	1	here ya goi have saturn in the fifth house my return was several years ago now i decided to finally honor the lifelong passion for art i stifled due to lack of talent and quit my well paying job stillllll miss the pay alas and create a career in the artsit was rough i was literally starting from scratch with no skills knowledge or connections but i did it  decided on fashion taught myself to sew did costume design alterations and custom sewing and have consistently earned at least some money from my sewing skills since then i will soon start teaching sewing at an adult ed center good luck to you
445	1	lmao yes this was several years ago went through some embarrassing phasesguys when dating i have actual selfrespect and i date men of color now
446	1	that is where i started too if it aint broke dont fix it helped alot with my sugar cravings
447	1	gah it just sucks im sorry when i first found out i had a fullon fucking meltdown and cried into a woman is arms who id just met that day i can tell you that i havent been upset by it since
448	1	you are not alone it is absolutely normal to have the feelings you do it is hard being responsible for a new life on top of everything else you are responsible for you will get through this one day one moment at a time peace and blessings to you
449	1	no that couldnt have been real omg
450	1	possibly
451	1	you late lol
452	1	exactly not shocking at all
453	1	ok thank you so much for your response this forum has made me think im not prepared for the lifestyle but if i think of any questions i will definitely reach out
454	1	thats the joke
455	1	this is really cool
456	1	of course its just one factor but it is a huge problem
457	1	me too
458	1	amen to that
459	1	i have nothing against a vegan diet but it is just a diet it is not even a new concept in human existence why are people acting like it is revolutionary the vegan lifestyle is largely a joke from what ive seen because it is so simplistic living in a way to harm as few living things as possible is a great thing but to do that you have to address your role in global markets and human suffering fuck not wearing leather
460	1	post massage headache  ive never heard of this did they warn you about that in advance if not you should let them know this happened in case it was caused by an error in technique
461	1	i was so glad that i found this sub when i first started using reddit i was posting occasional comments on blackpeopletwitter but then i soon  realized that that was not the sub i had assumed it was  somehow i found this sub i hear there is one for black dudes too but that is all i know about blackoriented subs on reddit which is probably sad but i dont do reddit beyond this sub and an assortment of niche subs because so much of reddit is racism sexism and other kinds of oppressive fuckery so i dont really get around much on here
462	1	very good question though i think it has to be met with the fact that these things happen but more often than not the person who made the comments isnt the one to overreact and then double down on their bullshit kevin hart apologized but its kind of hollow when you see he also calls it imaginary rage and makes a big whiny stink about it same goes for matt groening etc
463	1	it shouldnt be too bad some of the words are similar my boyfriend knows spanish and he was able to pick it up quickly when we went to brazil
464	1	gtblack men benefit from sexism and male privilege even though they are disadvantaged by racismexactly
465	1	so you think the grass is greener elsewhere
466	1	nobody more republican than former cubans and 1st gen asian immigrants
467	1	youre nasty
468	1	gt rice isnt great for asthmaticshmmm tilalso if that isnt a typo above this is my first time hearing someone call them bench eyed peas

471	1	my fiance wanted to watch it and it is my hbo now account so i forbid him from doing so none of her mess in our house with the account im paying for
472	1	thank you so much
473	1	gtim skeptical of the motives and ally status of any man who feels the need to try to shift the conversation when black men are told to treat women better
474	1	thank you so much honestly it is people like you that at least keep me going
475	1	it was a risk lol but worth it
476	1	it is the 20 year anniversary of the miseducation of lauryn hill album so she sang all the songs  killing me softly
477	1	why the hell does this not have any votes i will research this book
478	1	he is an arab morrocan who does not identify as black he was asked if he was black in an interview a few years ago and he vehemently denied being black a black woman called him out on twitter about his use of the word and he hurled racist insults at her publicly and no black rapper called him out in fact he is featured in many of their songs
479	1	i wonder if that user is also black cause she is doing exactly the same shit racist do generalize based on their isolated experiences and similarly i bet she doesnt generalize when dealing with white men though since they get treated as individuals
480	1	i disagree people modify language depending on whom theyre speaking with white folks as far as i know refrain from screaming racial slurs in the classroom why would the playground be any different dont explain away their agency but all the rappers say it how often do white folks get away with racial slurs in the presence of black people not very many it is usually the one white kid who lives in a poor black neighborhood those of you who went to hbcus actually that is an interesting question do white people get a pass on campusedit actually that is a really stupid question there is no universally recognized pass so the white person who says racial slurs here may not get away with it there
481	1	there is gimme a sec ill find it
482	1	yeahhhh im just venting at this point
483	1	i hate read her blog she is fucking nuts i guess im not a lot of black women
484	1	sounds fun i wish i knew someone near me that braided hair
485	1	im on your side i could see it when he was on the wire but now he just reminds me of somebody is grumpy daddy
486	1	no i wasnt it was south florida
487	1	finally somebody keeping it 100
488	1	like 90 percent of the people there are whiylte though
489	1	ive also wanted my nipples pierced but i am such a weenie lol was the hood piercing super painful
490	1	yeah u really dont want to get involved with someone who wasnt being upfront with you and who you were developing feelings for
491	1	it is pronounced sahyomah
492	1	gti particularly like subs for older people and subs on specific live events i anticipate in the future so while i sometimes feel spied on here i have to acknowledge that i spy on some groups as wellsis those spaces isnt meant for people of color solely the groups youre giving examples are extracurricular sub group
493	1	based on him saying basic woman to i think refer to white women i reckon this guy is white
494	1	nyc
495	1	gtfrom my understanding different definitions opinions etc if it means to involve a child of any sex constantly around black women empowerment only i dont think it is a good ideayou have more than implied that feminism does not support black menboys  beginning with the title of this thread im saying that feminism isnt somehow blocking black men amp black boys empowerment you can raise black men constantly around black feminism with out it being a bad idea
496	1	your post history is pure comedy tho
497	1	what is a dusty
498	1	i liked black panther dont get me wrong it is just i mostly related to awkward black woman in awful office job who is empowered by going off the mental deep end than i do a royal african isolationist who learns he can create his own cultural impact disregarding traditions
499	1	luckily it is not all doom and gloom it is really more of the history partof the museum that is like that the culture section is really where our people is influence shines the most either way im sure youll enjoy it
500	1	remember that black trans people exist please the bathroom thing wasnt even a thing until these white republican politicians needed something to detract from their constant bathroom scandals and stop using outdated terms i cant even believe that this comment is upvoted at all but reddit is still fucking reddit even in safe subs
501	1	couldnt she then make up a lie to get out of it altogether not knocking your idea  just thinking about using it for complete party avoidance p
502	1	didnt she try and make up some bullshit against odell beckham jr a couple of years back cause he wasnt interested in her stank ass
503	1	gtbut what i dont understand is why people think you dont have a true and valid commitment if youre not marriedmen and the laws they mademost men are terrible about commitment without social pressure i know enough men in nonmarriage committed relationships and basically all theyre doing is not cheating which is more than some married men but it is a gamble either way that piece of paper and the social pressure and clear expectations that come with it can go a long way into shaming most men into acting responsibly and going more than the minimum i personally wouldnt want a man like that but i really think theyre the normedit also legal issues like what is already been mentioned i also think in part it is practical advice legal status sets up boundaries and expectations for men and that matters in a misogynist society
504	1	basically telling us to get w the program and date out our race like them
505	1	wow
506	1	mmmm in my mind i was basing it off lifestylelower  struggling middle  sigh of relief upper  pays full price for college
507	1	home girl is gone for sure i cut her off that same year i met her she tried reaching out again after three years and i just explained what she did to make me block her like that and then i blocked her again
508	1	well there is a reason why guys arent noticing you i think if you care about it and want more male attention then you have to be honest and look at why that is i dont think its just race a lot of men are stupid and sexuality isnt as black or white as they want to believe a pretty girl will attract them regardless of race i dont know what you look like in the face or body or hair but maybe you need to learn how to flirt or something too personally i loved flirting when i was a teen i was into hispanic guys and they liked me back a lot too anyway in all likelihood youre average looking so to stand out you need to just do something a little different like learn to develop charisma and confidence
509	1	pushing interested parties away probably isnt helping you looking for insecurities when people obviously find you pretty is just selfsabotage there is nothing wrong with accepting some attention until it crosses the line like others have said 15 is extremely young most black women dont really start getting out and dating until college i was an incredibly awkward teenager who didnt really get out of my shell until college but school demographics may be the only reason no one is  ishowing interest not to mention boys are more focused on what their friends think than what they really want
510	1	she asked you to third wheel on a date if she didnt feel comfortable she shouldnt have met up with him until she didwe have to stop being the bodyguards for people we are valuable vulnerable women tooi know im just an outsider looking at a small portion of the picture but from this its not good i had a white co worker that would do this to me but didnt explicitly say it she would drive us both but if things went fine guess who was stranded at a bar
511	1	youre welcome take care of yourself sis
512	1	which is why its so dumb of him to sever his connections like this even roseanne barr is going to be unemployed for a long time who does he think he is
513	1	thanks
514	1	it probably would have happened either way the vast majority of men get insanely defensive when you question their relationship with sex
515	1	i dont think it is very fair to try and use personal anecdotes to undermine sociological data on black women and dating what you see isnt the sum total of common experiences both of my parents werent only black and neither were both of father is parents my grandma is a white womanthe fact that black women have greater rates of inrace dating isnt only a positive thing other races of women have better dating prospects just by the numbers if multiple races of men tend to be interested in your race there are more men with the potential of being interested in you black women so often are last pick and are unsuccessful in interracial dating compared to white asian and latina womenit is insulting to insinuate that the obviously racist experiences ive had in life and dating were in my head since i was looking for that kind of experience i am not selfsabatoging my love life

519	1	i think they did the right thing here they went together and left together it seems like they met in a public place they firmly told the man no and didnt mince words about it or act indecisive the only thing i would say is be careful about being under the influence of drugs and alcohol in situations like this but ultimately this entire situation falls on the man for being unable to accept a norejection and attacking women
520	1	uimreallyhungryfeedme hey it is the op here and it is my day off and im just reading over and replying back to comments i slightly read over your comment yesterday but things at the store got super busy and i didnt have the time nor didnt have the energy to properly respond now since it is my day off  i would like to add my two cents i kinda didnt like it when you said i was apart of the problem i was gonna be an asshole and bitch at you about it but dealing with rich white folk customers drains my energy enough and i didnt wanna go back n forward on a keyboard war with strangers on the internet like i said retail workers who arent managers of the store dont really have much of a say so i have no idea if you have ever worked in retail in a day of your life or worked in a job where you didnt have much of a say so but sometimes people cannot speak out yes i can be a timid ass passive aggressive person at times and i can also be assertive as well but when it comes to money and putting food on the table and paying bills  ispeaking up against a manager isnt an option for me due to capitalism and just being a cashier i just cannot be like hey just back off her she is just shopping with her kid blah blah or whatever as much i wanna educate my white managers and coworkers on racially profiling and anti blackness they arent gonna listen white folks dgaf and they never will that is just how i see it as much it annoys my manager when he calls people from the northeast and midwest yankees and go out his way to exceed his customer service to shoppers who trump supporters i really cannot do shit so if i wanna talk shit about my job or people i work with on a reddit forum anonymously then let me do as what i please i dont mean to come at you like a bitch or anything im coming to you cordially as a stressed out black 22 year old girl who is tired and just trying to survive and i just get tight sometimes when ppl on the internet try to sayassumeor suggest things out of my power and saying i aint doing shit right the world is already hard on me at is lmao  i appreciate your advice but just please hear me out ampx200bumamastrikes88 thank you for your kind words like seriously my job is wearing me down a bit and it is fucking with my borderline personality disorder and other mental illnesses i suffer with im trying to save up to move to europe for awhile and unfortunately the economy and job market here in my medium sized north carolina city is so scarce and it is such a shit show im unsure if i can find other employment anytime soon most jobs out here pay between 79 by an hour and i currently make 11 by an hour i need my eleven bucks yo and im sticking with this until something bigger and better comes along
521	1	loza tamhttpslozatamcomturbansatinlinedheadwrapsandturbans makes really nice prewrapped turbans that are satin lined and slightly cheaper than grace eleyae is but still high quality

525	1	again youre reachingif im tired of reading about it that means im hold ontired of readingtalking about itif i didnt want other people to talk about it i would say hey dont talk about it which would be retarded to tell a bunch of strangers to dothis is not that hard to comprehend i agreed with another poster that were tried of seeing talking about this shit so guess what we dont doyikesedit are you crying about downvotes after you automatically downvoted me as soon as i post lmfao big yikes
526	1	i dont know if i want a black man woman giving me a job just because we are folks doesnt that promote more divisiveness amongst us allmake this make sense because white people do this shit all the time theres a reason why people stress the importance of networking most white people i know get jobs because they have a family member working in the industry or they know someone who does why is it a problem when black people do itand who the fuck cares how white and asian people view our accomplishments
527	1	i was just about to comment this lol
528	1	we were already out and she just invited him along because we were having a good night and he was supposed to be a decent guy turn out that wasnt the case
529	1	i think the issue of massincarceration cant be laid at the feet of black women and black feminism that is an issue for the black struggle at large those things happening to black men are not because of black women so looking for a solution in this movement is misplaced imo i think it is also important to consider where the black feminist movement came from it was born out of the frustrations that some black women had with having to deal with sexism and abuse within the civil rights movement at the hand of black men specifically imagine fighting for the rights of black people only to be sidelined and even abused by the people who are struggling with you who should know better that context needs to be taken into accountalso a lot of black feminists tend to be activists against racism in general anyway most are always wearing two hats due to intersectionality
530	1	who are you to tell someone what power they have and they are already sick from food surroundings financially sick mentally sick and so fourth statistics says more about the stresses of black women men and children unrealistic harmful impossible yo i have to go thereim in the south i see nothing butwhite communitiesjewish communitiesarab communitieschinesejapanesevietnamese communities north african of different descent like ethiopean swahili moorish communities shall i go further and what i mean by community is they have their own schools educationchurches restaurants shopping centers transportation gas station etc shall i continue health care practices meaning they hire they own to cure them then you have different sovereign groups that consist of native tribes and nativrafrican tribes who dont even subscribe to the us constitution etc and youre telling me it is impossible and unrealistic mama im not saying youre the problem bc you are trying your best but that mindset is going to keep us all in their control which is the main reason you got people thinking light skinned is better straight amp curly is acceptable learn about englishfrenchbritish history all day long than their own selves instead of saying hey let is do what white people are doing let is do better on our own by our own
531	1	gt  i have no response to being called a black woman without feeling like a fraud a little bitdont feel like a fraud i have a very panafrican outlook i realize that we are different culturally but the struggles of slavery and colonialism are linked just educate yourself on our history while youre here and educate your friends and family whenever you go back to visit and teach people about your culture while youre here
532	1	that is for the subtle reminder of pinterest especially using tv character names i love molly is from insecure style she fluctuates between upscale lawyer and downtown chic i will give it a look on pinterest thank you for the other store recommendations as well

538	1	gt it seems all the hard work i put into being successful is meaningless  gt  gtfeeling a bit aimless and isolated at the moment thoive been feeling that way too lately sometimes you just need to gather your strength wishing you the bestampx200b
539	1	she never said that how many black friend are you going to make in white suburbia shes literally me she didnt say she rejected black people
540	1	when im really not feeling it but i cant put it off i watch some hair twin wash day videos on youtube for motivation
541	1	its one thing if his money came from his own money independent of the church salary though a pastor is supposed to give tithes too i think that what else they do with their money is fair game but imo if hes spending 200k just for his wife his financial priorities dont lie in the right place which is whats even more concerning
542	1	there already are but theyre called everything under the sun just for putting themselves first it tends to be worse for black women who do this in this country because a lot of us have been indoctrinated to be accommodating to men first even to our detriment
543	1	yes
544	1	congrats how long were you on tinder or online dating before meeting him
545	1	just to use your thoughts as a jumping off point first ill say that im not sure what the statute of limitations should be re shitty comments however the defense i keep seeing of that was a long time ago maybe theyve changed kind of grinds my gears there have been others besides hart and this has come up a few times when the tweetscomments are 510 years old but the dude is like 40 sorry he was not some hotheaded teenager popping off at the mouth who had some growing up to do he was a grown ass man when he said it and if he didnt get called out on it at the time i highly doubt he is changed i feel like this is a huge difference to the kind of leeway we should be giving to actual young people or were young when they made the comment
546	1	this needs more upvotes but how do you know its the same person
547	1	i know right like wtf
548	1	oh wow doesnt sound too bad overall glad you got to enjoy yourself
549	1	why optional

551	1	best believe if dems dont put up an exciting candidate trump will win again the young people wont get excited for warren i say beto
552	1	thank you this is just 100000 of the point i wanted to make but didnt feel like typing this viewpoint is so toxic im surprised i actually saw it in this subreddit
553	1	your last sentence is very true
554	1	when you say the newer ones are you referring to the prequels or movies 7 and 8
555	1	i meant to add that i dont think sustainable love and marriage are mutually exclusive but what i dont understand is why people think you dont have a true and valid commitment if youre not married commitment is demonstrated in so many ways having children building relationships with each other is families making sacrifices supporting each other is dreams loving each other through hard times when someone says if you dont marry me im leaving you  what i hear is i want to be with you forever so im leaving you which doesnt make sense to me and at the same time i dont think there is any glory in white knuckling through a relationship that is no longer working and calling it commitment which is how i feel about a lot of the marriages ive seen growing up  if it turns out that one person couldnt meet your needs as your partner for your entire life there is actually no shame in that we grow and change so much as people in a lifetime and sometimes relationships no longer work because of that it is natural and it is ok imo it doesnt in anyway degrade the love you have for that person the idea of lifetime companionship is really nice and i do want that as well if it works out for me i guess at some point for some people it becomes and inconvenience to not be legally married and i think that is an unfortunate reality of a capitalist culture  i just think it is kind of fucked up to a reduce a long term loving relationship to waiting for a ring
556	1	right we need to remember pastors like these are a stark minority  some people like going to certain churches too not all of them are made equal perhaps one pastor is more charismatic than another one the american style of church worship is pretty popular too especially among youth furthermore there are plenty of churches that do a lot for their community and they do so much that people even take advantage of it then those same people will also complain if they dont get help ive experienced it firsthand in my church
557	1	i know
558	1	that is definitely a good thing to spoil yourself
559	1	you cant relate to the study about black women because a lot of times its not about blackness but the presentation of blackness since there are black women who have more european features these studies are gonna be disingenuous because a lot of times people discriminate against darker skinned less eurocentric featured 4c haired black women and not all black women posess these features its why so many boys will say im not into black women but halle berry is an exception
560	1	i thought my brother was fine until he offered to give me a backrub he was ten years older than me and i couldnt have been older than 14 after that i was creeped tf out and never let myself be alone with him again i never said anything because it was kind of an impossible topic to bring up i later found out he tried the same backrub crap with one of our cousins and molested our sister i dont believe in safe men and not safe men i believe in being mindful of every damn man regardless of how well you think you know him i suspect this woman is the same way abusers arent rare they arent obviously bad people who can be avoided with a bit of effort theyre family friends cousins uncles brothers and yes husbands
561	1	thank you and im really glad to hear that i go to school in a predominantly whiteasian area and am excited to be around more people that i can relate to
562	1	gttruly for me and speaking for me aloneif you were speaking for you alone you wouldnt have felt the need to make that comment on this post like i said im skeptical of you not just your post gti think it is important not to let my adulation cloud my moral assessmentsif you have an issue with adulation of someone whose social connections youre that critical of you should probably go deal with that personally i dont see any of the women on this thread exhibiting that problem
563	1	this is the worst thing i have read today wow how can people be so disgusting
564	1	interesting i thought it was more just an american thing in certain states more so thsn others the sheer level of rudeness is borderline impressive it still does pale in comparison to what you would get in the likes of china though or from a sadly significant amount of nigerian women very specifically on public transport in ireland
565	1	dont come out of that bush
566	1	the level of mental gymnastics that some users on reddit employ to excuse gender based violence never ceases to astound me
567	1	i got prescribed opioids i never even used after my my wisdom teeth were pulled out but that was 8 years ago before the crisis was acknowledgedwhen i was waking up with excruciating pain in the middle of the night that i suspected was related to endometriosis the doctor gave me 600mg ibuprofen pills that did absolutely nothing i went to another and they switched my birth control which fixed the issue could be racism it could be a doctor thats plain trash
568	1	i feel you on the depression because of it being constantly beaten down because of racism takes a huge toll the book post traumatic slave disorder by joy degruy helped me a ton i hope you stay strong too youre not crazy in the slightest and youre not alone
569	1	i know the sub is a mess amp a half but i was not expecting to see so many black men who obviously despise black women cosigning this mess amp degrading us
570	1	this is how ive grown to feel about it allat the end of the day if the relationship isnt healthy or right  it doesnt matter if youve waited 2 years or 12 the shit isnt going to work because of that marriage is something i want  but i want to be in secure healthy partnership above all else  ill be patient for that
571	1	i absolutely know what you mean about the contact info lol we would usually talk to any black family we met randomly if only to have people to invite over ever now and thensorry to hear about you experience with that teacher luckily i was spared in primary school but i met my own share of nasty teachers later on the thing is my mother isnt from a wealthy family so even when people invoke the famous african mud hut it is a point of pride for me lol ive slept in a hut like that before it is not the height of comfort but if it was good enough for my mother it is good enough for me not to mention western architects are now doing research on traditional african building materials because they are very environmentally friendly and have excellent isolating qualities despite being made from natural fibres and you know how that goesbut i get what you mean i was also asked if i spoke african
572	1	it is really good i dont know how to describe what steve mcqueen does but he is a master at it i jumped in my seat a couple of times at stuff i didnt see coming and felt myself getting physically tense during the climax
573	1	good yeah i kinda of fell into this industry after college myself and just never left it is cool working with schools and educators though
574	1	the author is a georgetown law professor who spent twenty years as a dc prosecutor before seeing the error in his ways quitting his job and using that insider information to write a book about police abolition
575	1	i have no idea what you are saying
576	1	thank you hoping it wont be as big as a shit show as i am anticipating
577	1	yes i will stay one step ahead it is just annoying that i have to be concerned about this at all gt it may take time but eventually someone in a higher position of authority will figure him out and deal with him accordinglynah ive seen these types get to those higher positions beforemy old boss was the type who charmed his way to the top also once youre in the public service permanently it is very hard to get fired we call the public service golden handcuffs he is set for life making more than the average canadian family while doing the bare minimum it is frustrating
578	1	thank you i should not have said all men just the assholes at the job
579	1	girl go look at trevonte rhodes and kofi siriboe too i actually had to unfollow all the men i was thirst following they were all so fine that it began to irritate me
580	1	and its sad because due to being in constant white spaces and not feeling good enough and being dismissed constantly i do crave validation a lot  which is why im in therapy i hate that about myself because people who dont know me do really like me and dont know about my self esteem issues
581	1	no and im no longer interested in finding love or getting married or having kids
582	1	i understand what you mean about being in white spaces and wanting validation high school was like that for me and it wasnt until i left that environment that i started to feel better it really does take a toll on your selfesteem all in all i think it is good that youre honest with yourself that is how we can start to heal amp move forward blessings to you
583	1	thanks thats reassuring i appreciate your thoughts well see what happens
584	1	i might think that if there wasnt a long history of mediocre films winning oscars
585	1	im just shocked they got raz b to act right long enough to pull this off he was estranged in china for awhile engaging in a lot of crazy reckless behavior
586	1	thank u next
587	1	thank you i do have a synthetic wig but i think i have a small head because it fits over my ears and slides off lol i have never thought of a closure that may be something to consider
588	1	i wish people would read up about the slave trade this is not rocket science
589	1	do you and other mods knowrecognize users well enough to verify some users who could be a part of this sub if it went private then you could slowly vet other users who apply and who have compatible comment history im just wondering about the logistics of how going private would work but also thinking of how you all would define membership eligibility too sorry im just rambling through my thoughts here i appreciate all the work that you mods do here this is definitely the best modded sub on reddit
590	1	you are absolutely right some black people think this is the only way to survive and be acceptable to them we hear so many stories of everyday blacks in predominantly white spaces succumbing to stereotypes good or bad to be accepted so it is no shock that it happens in entertainment where millions of dollars is at stake one thing that comes to mind as an example to what you wrote is allowing nonblack people to jump in hiphop make bs songs because that is what these people think the genre is all about ie post malone is comments about hiphop being mindless or allowing nonblack rappers to use the nword ie french montana and tekashi 69 or how tf ever he spells that shit there is no accountability from black rappers especially the ones who actually hold a lot of power in the industry
591	1	yeah that does sound like a ton of work
592	1	theyre obviously the same thing  completely comparable you can make your argument without dragging us into it it is not that hard
593	1	lol thank you i was gonna say no no it is worse an ebony the absolute fuck
594	1	usually i just shampoo condition and add a leavein and gel ive accepted that im never going to get a ton of definition without a ton of dryness and flaking if im planning to do a wash and go i will not comb or brushjust finger detangle i apply products on dripping wet hair in the shower if it doesnt dry before i go to sleep which is always because i have low porosity hair and a propensity for washing my hair at night i put it in four ponytails and sleep under a satin cap wake up shake spritz fluff in the shower and go i find that the palmer is curling custard and eco styler gel works very well together but they need to be sealed with an oil or the moisture just disappears in two days
595	1	what does what mean

605	1	actually middle class would be closer to 50000 the median income of all americans about 30 of people make this amounthttpswwwnprorgsectionsmoney20120716156688596whatamericansearnand income inequality is increasing by the day strangely these numbers calculate government benefits but exclude things like stocks and real estate which would skew the devide even furtheredit the fact that poverty is attributed to personality is so frustrating to me after being surrounded by rich people at my school i dont think being rich is that much of an achievement anymore its not something that i would link with someones work ethic or behavior after a certain point of wealth it becomes incredibly easy to just make more money
606	1	i mean he couldnt have bought her a lexus suv and used the other 150k for bus passes for those in need im just concerned at how many people dont see how conspicuous consumerism especially at the extreme of this level is inherently anti christian doesnt matter where the cash came from and doesnt matter if he was a preacher or not honestly it is always anti christian the context just makes it also hypocritical
607	1	whats funny is it doesnt matter if you say no or not theyre still going to do what they wanna do
608	1	by keen i mean sharper or small or just more acceptable to western beauty ideals
609	1	thanks
610	1	yeah but other people have done those things and dont defend rapists either
611	1	gtyou say natives are migrants they originally migrated from africa asia mexico etc at the time a lot of them  were dark or had a shade of brown gtyou say that africans migrated to north america precolonialism so therefore north american people who identify as having african ancestry might not be fully african but you just said those native migrants are africanyes because multiple of bands native tribes intermixed without any african ancestry  some tribes are mixed with african ancestry because of similar cultural perspectives  thousands of years ago tribes of africa migrated along with other ethnicities  at the time majority were all people of color one tribe wasnt always here by themselves i would assume multiple tribes of different regions came around the same time or was separated during pangaea gtdo you just mean there were some indigenous people who were darker skinnedi didnt just mean that i mean majority of them were people of color the specifics of shade isnt exactly clear to megti dont understand why this is a thing in the usa for a myriad of reasons but that is your culture and you have your reasonsthis is not a thing because we have been erased out of history book with imposter natives who are descendants of euronative spanishnative we were also told that we came straight out of africa with no history of ever migrating or shaping history before colonization we were even told millions of the natives were dead and hardly existing that is false they are existing we are either mixed with african slaves or other tribes of dark descent check out the southern states and their origins gtyou seem confused by what i said the original caribbean amerindians were migrants from south america the orinoco river is in the south american continent and they travelled through it and came upon the caribbean islands which were previously uninhabited european colonization resulted in genocide but some places still have communities of peoples or at least are aware of their ancestry if there was mostly miscegenation hmmm that is interesting to learn
612	1	yea i signed up because im curious the forum has a pretty ui as well i wasnt gonna give my real name tho lol no way imagine if the forum ever got hacked and users exposed
613	1	yea i feel where both of you are coming from i guess we will see how it pans out 6 or so months from now personally  i just feel like youtubers have been recently dictating what is real black so seeing this forum with it is test triggered me again as my family is a range of skin tones and were all black since as far as i can tell
614	1	you become consumed by the other person so thats what youre seeing it is fun and exciting if thats what you want but for me it sounds exhausting right now haha when youre with someone and its the honeymoon phase then theyre almost all that you can think about and you talk about them all the time and its like an obsession but you cant help it the brain in love is a wild ride if you havent experienced that then yeah i think its aomething everyone should understand because its weird lol you want to show the person off because youre head over heels and that expression makes sense when youve felt this way because i think you realize how insane you feel like youre all over the place and floating with excitement then it melts away and you get to see the person youre with for who they are with all of their flaws and everything and thats when the real relationship begins
615	1	im not saying that any one behavior automatically equals defending rapists im saying that when someone is seeking outside approval to the extent she is it makes it more likely to look for love at anyall costs
616	1	gt that is a huge statement you have there any sources that has been conducted by us it least all men arent raised with that and what type of homesettings are these found in better yet if you dont feel like showing me anything is there any particular words i should take up on my ownwe all are if it is not in the home it is in media music and communities try hypermasculinity gtour name isnt dragged by the dirt consistantly and is being more recognized then any other political issues besides blmim not sure what point youre trying to make gtthat is why i said they are trying to spread it the word did you not read the part i said theyre posts their groups their speeches books opinions are instantly being shut down hell im talking about the good men here and my post is being shut down by asking i dont agree from taking away all the hard work we accomplished im just asking do we support or willedwilling to add them onyoure not being shut down youre getting an answer you dont want to hear it is not our problem especially not to address on this sub they need to do more and start in their own spaces they dont need us for this and our presence can actually impede their progress and endanger us gtfemales are piling up into these groups then the men themselves bc it is a low population of black men already there are plenty of black men around theyre busy on reddit twitter and all over social media look at the size and activity of blackfellas compared to here theyre choosing where they want to engage gtyou literally have women that just degrade them and not listen when they listenunderstand usthere are men who come to this sub to defend violence against black women that is an incredibly inaccurate blanket statement gtthese men seriously dont have a chance their content isnt being shared enough and it is not too many of the good onesi see black men sharing content all the time again theyre choosing what they do and dont share there is no amount of work we can do to turn that around weve been trying for generations and they make their choices

622	1	thank you you are so kind

626	1	im guilty of liking pearl the best i wont lie mostly because she had the prettiest fusions but now seeing that pearl is supposed to be a white woman and garnet is supposed to be black and comparing opal to sugilite i guess the show wasnt as progressive as it was advertised to be and rebecca sugar has some underlying prejudices even though she is a feminist though there have been fans that called her out for this before because there are some articles on it
627	1	darling not once did i say i was perfect but i will not take the blame for emotional abuse take care and have a merry christmas

635	1	that is great to hear im sorry about all that bs you probably had to go through i usually end dates early if i feel the person is being disrespectful or rude i had a woman once ask me for money to help pay for her end of the rent like bitch please i definitely never spoke to her again im wondering if i give off this desperate vibe as well i will have to work on that if i am
636	1	would have blown me away if mlk hit me with that heat in collegehe is so clear and direct in his speeches which is why it is downright criminal that we get this super abbreviated version that says i have a dream he is so much more than that and his words still knock today
637	1	im very much not a typical case i think my husband and i are naturally very fertile and we got pregnant the first cycle we tried to get pregnant but then i miscarried except my body wasnt taking care of it naturally so i needed to have some procedures done to clear out my uterus the complications of those procedures have damaged my uterus to the point that embryos just havent been able to implant and if i do get pregnant again im at higher risk for a wide variety of complications we did ivf to preserve some embryos and to verify that yes the issue really is my uterus so far ive failed two transfers of very good looking chromosomally normal embryos  if the third one i just transferred fails then well do maybe one more and then start looking for a gestational surrogatemiscarriages are common far more common than most people realize my husband and i both have several relatives including our mother who have had at least one miscarriage however every single one of them has 2 or more children as well so i wouldnt worry about that meaning you cant have children just brace yourself that pregnancy loss is a very real thing that many people experience there is a smaller subset of people who have multiple miscarriages and really struggle to carry a baby to term but up to 23 of them still go on to have children as wellso for the most part you really just dont know until you try however there are some very basic tests that you can get done if youre curious about your baseline numbers and whether you should start sooner rather than later some optionsexamples of what you would testhttpsmodernfertilitycomhttpsmodernfertilitycomhttpseggwhisperercomhowitworkshttpseggwhisperercomhowitworksampx200b
638	1	thank you so much i also just found a few sites about having kids on my own i would like to get started asap but money
639	1	no i havent im intrigued
640	1	please self indulge in selfishness
641	1	i was about to post this too ive spoken several people who want to pursue breast reduction surgery because of the pain their large breasts cause them i also personally know someone who chose surgery to remove dramatic scarring from a previous surgery historically plastic surgery was life changing for soldiers who returned home disfigured and it still is life changing for many people yes we need to help people love their bodies and curb jealousy but we dont have to vilify plastic surgery
642	1	all these issues are so divisive and they weaken arguments of true racism and ignorance when someone on the right sees this they will take the real things less seriously because it makes it seem like everyone does nothing but complain then when the left sees that they naturally get angrier because their actual issues arent being taken seriously you can replace left with black or women or any other marginalized group this is what these corporations want
643	1	she comes off as more insecure than anything
644	1	do you want to respond to my comment or try to deflect
645	1	i guess the only place where i hear genuine concern about penalties is from comedians the really good ones dont always bank their jokes from third rail topics so im inclined to give them more rope ill hear them outlike anything else if your jokes bomb that is on you you cant blame the crowd for not laughing on the other hand audiences who feign puritanity if that is even a word lol is probably really annoying it is like asking people their political beliefs and everyone says socially liberal because that is the correct answer you know damn well there are people out here who are racist but seldom do you hear folks admit they are racistas for regular joes i havent heard much more than grumbling about sensitivity and we cant do such and such anymore
646	1	then he shouldnt repeat himself its not like this was an isolated incident and hes had a big stinky whiny post about fake anger and hes not being tossed out on the street hes not just doing one job among the many others hes gotten in the past and could get in the futurelets not play the everybody makes mistakes card when not everybody maturely owns up to them
647	1	see you there 2020
648	1	i mean if you have to go to an hbcu to find a black man that exclusively dates black woman then that further proves my point you can find black women like this at pwis community college and in any random profession all over the country but the same cannot be said for black mencopying my other reply to answer the rest tbh i just hear this often from other black women on reddit and other internet forumssocial media so thats how i assume it is i also get a lot of interest from black men but im only half black and whenever i try to say that dating has never been an issue for me im quickly shut down because my experience is different as a mixed woman which i understand and agree with my opinion is more towards black women who feel they have a hard time dating because of their race while purposely shrinking their dating pool by exclusively dating black men
649	1	if it is his business why did he tell everyone
650	1	it did at the time but a friend just showed me his instagram about a week ago and im so glad that didnt work out i wouldnt even try it again unless it was with a man who already demonstrated he was willing to put effort into a relationship
651	1	yes indeedsoutheastern al northwestern fl
652	1	lena hasnt had good coverage on jezebel for a few years they have their white feminism blind spots but lena dunham isnt one of them
653	1	heeeeeey
654	1	being supportive of meghan and being critical and aware of that family is history are not mutually exclusive
655	1	ah shoot i missed your response whoops ion know but i like fried fish a little bit too much than to start writing us off no siree bob
656	1	hehe im still bad at it and i used to compete at national math competitions anyone can play it or do math

658	1	gtyou found the one that is worth a damn i found plenty mines worth everything im pretty sure youre still single and bitter and you know what even if youre not i wonder what type of men you find that hear your nonsense on how a whole sex of one race is trash they are going to look at you crazy and if not he with you for the same reason
659	1	im still curious what was the name of the coed sub
660	1	good luck
661	1	gti believe it is founded on connections between individual believers and groups of believers whether that involves a church or notso we literally agree on the same thing like jesus said where two or more are gathered in his name he is with them i also said the church is more than a physical building i never said the definiton of church was limited to individual churches you can form individual connections with believers in your basement so it wont be a church in the traditional sense but that doesnt make it any less a part of the church the church is a spiritual and a physical thing gti also believe that a church may or may not be a part of the church but that all dependsthat means it is either its own sect of christianity or that is a heretic form of christianity like the protestants and the catholic church
662	1	that is so inappropriatecant believe that actually happened glad you got out of there
663	1	so just to clarify you met the man that is currently your husband through online dating and you bonded because you were both into cyclingsimilar hobbies
664	1	the video dont help sis children dont always understand lyrics but theyll understand and comprehend images better she doesnt have to market herself to children shes just a big famous entertainer that schools friends clubs tvs radios commercials etc say she is everywhere and she cant deny it and please dont mention of the lack of parenting because honestly entertainers are shapinginfluencing children than their own parents we can only influence so much once these babies walk out these doors cardi b endorsers and fans will eventually shape the minds of the youth im not discrediting her work at all but it is a no brainer that children will mock what they see this is not something they should see either there has to be strict internet codes or music need to tad down a bit on sexualization
665	1	it sucks a lot they either dont post black cosplayers or the post the same 5
666	1	maybe slacking off was a poor choice of words im a full time pharmacy major that is barely pulling bs in any of my classes japanese is time consuming thing for me maybe ill work on it over christmas vacation
667	1	gtnobody more republican than former cubans and 1st gen asian immigrants
668	1	this right here im typically the ugly friend when im with a group of girls although im actually more on the cuteplain side thank you very much 1 perception some girls are pop music  everyone likeswants them im indieunderground im something special and it is going to take a special kind of guy to recognize me and more often than not if he is into me hell be worth it 2 perception a lot of the attention my better looking friends get comes from trash guys who may look good or talk sweet but theyre really not worth much 9 times out of 10 3 attention irl im a mouse online i let myself out sure it hasnt been wildly successful yet but it certainly makes me feel comfortable and allows me to bring more of my true self out on a date
669	1	this is not my mom lol i just saw this on my instagram and thought to repost this but yes spread the word too bad im in north carolina and i physically cannot make a trip there anytime soon to support this black owned bodega
670	1	im hoping to use my side hustle to pay off my student loans so i feel you
671	1	and for the record yes black men are expected to not be misogynistic it is not conditional it is not based on the women here being nice or sexually available or here for emotional labor thats because you are in a position of privilege compared to women same way people on this sub cant be transphobic or homophobic regardless to what the black lgbtq community says about cis gendered straight people you can shove your but were all black ignore your mistreatment bullshit with you and your man feelings when you go
672	1	oh my goodnessmy boss does this
673	1	im using new reddit and didnt find it
674	1	it is super duper corny i do like that the episodes are short and that it is lighthearted i think the twins are the best part about the show
675	1	i too shed a tear when i read how majority of white america feels about me and my fellow people of color like seriously what in the hell have we done to these people for them to demean us  i say its jealousy
676	1	this comment that user name please no
677	1	you need to be respectful of what women say on this sub your comment dismissing the previous poster  your user name give off the impression you dont intend to do that get it together
678	1	unpaid internship newsrooms say kim kardashian made hoop earrings popular thats such a perfect statement what a great thread
679	1	im sorry for what happened to your family members holocaust deniers are cut from the same cloth definitely if you want to get really mad look up the atrocities of the free state of the congo aka king leopolds massacre i was twentyone years old before i even heard it happened after a trip to the museum people want to sweep mass evil under the rug and mortify anyone who dares call them out on it its sickhttpswwwgooglecomampsamptheguardiancomtheguardian1999may13features11g22
680	1	too bad full asian people are too busy being super antiblack and calling black people slaves and all that black people shouldnt ever associate with racists like that
681	1	that was really cute
682	1	agreed i know it can seem like there is a disproportionate amount of threads in this sub dedicated to discussing the negative things we struggle with in our community but i think that reading about these experiences has more of a positive effect than a negative one it gives us the chance to bond over shared experiences and build each other up i dont think the best way to overcome the mental roadblocks caused by internal stereotyping is to stop talking about them entirely within the sub
683	1	gtsoi do what i usually do i put on an overly intense smile and made direct unwavering eye contactnot aggressive just unnerving stepford wives level eye contact i should try this
684	1	kind of its similarly campy and similarly horror related id say its more like horror riverdale which was enough to get me to watch it as im not a riverdale fan
685	1	if anything the little girl responded more calmly than most of us would
686	1	she is always like that it is fucking exhausting
687	1	i disagree the movie had it flaws however it was entertaining and had a plot that was easy to followmost of the cast was well acted and the visuals were stunning the movie could have been better but it is far from trash
688	1	where was the story youtube
689	1	yes they know this i took similar classes and was always taught about the rewrite
690	1	yawn you have access to a bunch of black women is thoughts on here for every selfhating black woman there are more black women telling her why she is wrong you dont have 247 access to any celebrity is life
691	1	yep i had a friend who started to describe herself as such due to the feedback she is gotten from othersstrangersetc but frankly it is because the way she carried herself was very aloof to any one else she wasnt tactful at all and to othersstrangers it comes off as rude and heartless but lol it is who she was i only checked it when it was targeted my way and tried to be the peacemaker when we would go out and someone got pissed at her
692	1	i think coloured is not a word people use nowadays because it is seen as offensive someone can correct me on that  if i am wrong im in england coloured is not offensive in zim or south africa but its definitely offensive in other parts of the world its just a descriptor to say mixed race and coloured people in zimbabwe would not be offended by it as for my white colleague i could tell she wasnt being racist but was just ignorant she hadnt encountered many people of colour at that point hence the struggle with knowing which descriptors to use
693	1	you know the tweets werent all jokes though right like calling someone a fat fag wheres the punchline
694	1	not trumps level of dirt huh trump has yet to lie the country into s catastrophic war ending in the deaths of millions to name just one but ok  looks like the rehabilitation is proceeding apace
695	1	i identify very hard with the faith based life but im also getting slapped by the reality of god helps those who help themselves i have been very passive in certain aspects and im finally putting my foot down with help from friends maybe just talk to her about what she thinks will happen and make a mini plan to get to those goals give her steps to pray about instead of just a big picture
696	1	gt brutally honest or direct these two i always immediately dismiss especially these older men you should know better by now adding sarcstic to the list
697	1	gtim just so impressed with how supportive and kind and educational the responses are from the responders on here i frequent lipstick alley and let me tell you this is not how this convo would have gone down over theretheyre two very different places
698	1	back when i was on fetlife some of the fetishes of the black women that were there i know were not supposed to kinkshame but wanting to be someone is pretty little nigger slut in your bio is just too wild for me too many people is kinks were just racial fetishes i feel like those are in two different ballparks and it frustrates me that that is supposed to be totally acceptable in terms of protecting someone is kink
699	1	gt i think you misunderstood me in this entire conversation i in no way condone what he did what i have a problem with is you dragging christianity down with its members by not only attacking him but attacking pastors that lead megachurches attacking pastors that have valuable possessions and getting defensive when people say not to generalize all christiansmaybe but i also think we address a similar if not exactly the same problem in a very different way i see all of those things as related in a certain way and dont believe in separating them before critiquing gtso why is it that saying not all churches is a bad thing how will more people be attracted to the church when they generalize everything and put it all in one boxthe same reason saying not all white peoplemenstraightciscops is a bad thing i believe in examining and critiquing an in group before drawing lines because while the statement is technically true it is also a very useful tool for abdicating responsibility and opportunity to make change that is bigger than just the few good apples it is also an almost definite guarantee that the people who are doing good and who have the most opportunity to make change will never escape stigma or a bad reputation i dont believe christianity is exempt from that and i think being honest about how issues flow through even good christians is the first step in attracting the people god calls to his church even if they dont or cant connect with a church people hear not all all the time from every corner i completely believe changing this stepping away from defensiveness and doing the hard painful work is a chance for christians to stand out from the rest of the world but i also understand why someone wouldnt agree with that approach gtwe absolutely can address the problems in the church without silencing people but we also need to show the world that not every church is full of greed and strife personally i think the problem is bigger than how people view church it is how they view christians i think mostly because of conversations ive had the vast majority of people know that not every church is full of corruption i dont even necessarily believe john gray is is to be honest just like i think they know that all white people arent evil and that every single cop isnt a murderer that is why i dont think the not all message is enough i dont think protecting or elevating individual churches no matter how good will ever be enough especially since all of us christians and non live the majority of our lives outside the church building and groups gtyou werent raising pitchforks against just him you were doing it against christianity as a whole and when i tried to tell you there are good christians out there you shut me down this is probably where we differ again because i dont see the church or churches and christianity as the same thing just things that overlap but i know there are good christians out there theyre some of my closest friends and family but like i said i dont believe in not all ing anything not even groups im a member ofgtfurthermore we need to be careful not to use a pastor as substitute for our relationship with god i hear so many people that have had bad experiences with christians that they dont like church because they dont want to depend on pastors and be blind sheep or other statements like that but of course youre not supposed to follow your pastor blindly you are supposed to put effort into your personal relationship with god and merely use the pastor as a supplement and for spiritual guidance but not as a primary source god is supposed to be the primary source the role of a pastor is to help you develop your relationship with god in the first placeagreed i also think there is more behind those statements than the surface but that is a completely separate conversation
700	1	yes i have no complaints there although theyve primarily been asian or middle eastern
701	1	can you move out  not break up just say that you dont want to live together anymore since there is no actual commitment  still see him but give him a chance to miss you and make a decision about marriage one way or another for him and yousome men dont see the need to commit if they are already getting their needs met  if you move out and end up breaking up it would have happened anyway  if someone wants to marry you they will pursue it
702	1	gthowever if a pastors pulls up in a luxury car and gives his wife a piece of jewelry we shouldnt be so quick to raise eyebrows i disagree especially in a society that idolizes money and wealth and especially in a religion where our central figure chose to enter this earth in poverty and sacrifice so much to help the poor were not conditioned to see the signs of greed and the love of money as indications of major spiritual issues but they are and us not doing that is one of the main reasons the black church is having the issues it is now
703	1	oh they definitely would have still been on his ass for a porsche which is why i ask where is the line and im not sure why the churchs money is even a part of this convo at all since he didnt spend it but    i dont care enough about this to bring this thread into a new day
704	1	cubans in america are typically white though along with still being latino theyre mostly spanish since the native taino of cuba were mostly killed off some people are obviously are black or are mixed with a little of of other things but cubans americans are typically whiteedit to add also it is important to remember that brazilians are latino or at least most claim the latino label but are not hispanic as they dont speak spanish ethnically theyre quite mixed though so labels can be tricky at pointsedit again i should clarify that i was thinking in the us and not referring to cubans in cuba theyre still quite mixed in cuba if interested cuba itself is only 40 white with another 40 being mestizo super interesting
705	1	and to add on real quickmy parents stressed education on myself and my siblings so that we produce generational wealth and debunk the stigma that black people are uneducated worthless beingsi used to hate how strict they were in comparison to my white friends but its because blacks have to be its unfair yes but i would be lying to say that it didnt make me a hell of a strong girl where racism and discrimination does not alter my determination plus its fun to shock racists that i come from a successful family i speak eloquently and gasp i  am intelligent beautiful with my dark skin and carry myself with such grace
706	1	they looked at us like charity cases before affirmative action
707	1	yikes gross
708	1	sending virtual hugs
709	1	true there is always the proverbial smokefilled back room where the power class can be nonpc among themselves like old daysi know i saw a clip of jerry seinfeld talking about how hell never play college campuses again and i was like ugh
710	1	podcasts my friend podcasts
711	1	i totally forgot about this game a friend brought it to school one day in elementary and it was a lot of fun
712	1	gt aya nakamurashe is stunning
713	1	actually really pretty for a black girl ive heard said  how could anyone think that is a compliment or ok to say
714	1	idk if you wanna go down the rabbithole of kpop antiblackness but its pretty bad
715	1	gt for what it is worth there will be a major collapse coming soon  bigger they are harder they fall and all that  it is already happening and it is not going to slow down as a group theyre miserable substance dependent and falling apart at the seams but are still reflexively focused on caravans black on black crime and the kind of terrorism that literally has the least impact on them at this point i think keeping a certain distance from them is a form of self protection
716	1	id actually love to visit a city like that i went to atlanta once and was shocked in walmat at all the black haircare products id been to black haircare stores in oakland that didnt have the same amount of inventory as that single aisle  i actually worried my relatives because i was in there so long  i have rarely been in black soaces and it isnt for lack of trying  ill do my homework then when i return some relative will tell me i didnt go to the right section or went at the wrong time
717	1	preferences xs ex are mostly blacklatinsasians because they happened to belong to that category however she dont dates them based off a stereotype nor does she excludes other races   fetish x only dated black guys because shes attracted to the stereotypical image of hood niggas and thinks that apply to all black guys thus she dated them because shes fetishizing that idea of them
718	1	if youre interested in connecting with more of us google blacks in tech we just had a conference earlier this year and we have a thriving slack group
719	1	im not african american so maybe single households are norm and there is rampant homophobia but it is also the case for two parent homes  there is still homophobia in two parent homes typical black family doesnt mean african american  it could mean any black person  especially if you live in nyc where a lot of black people are other black  what qualifies as typical
720	1	my white family has said nigga in the context of talking about how that word shouldnt be used by white people at all they agreed that they shouldnt use it at all but kept saying it during the discussion
721	1	this is how i feel like i enjoy the fact sometimes that im an exotic beauty for men i feel like im on a pedestal and a goddess and im just their whole mission in life but there is a line when it is a turn off when it is more like im just a fetish to cross off a list and brag about
722	1	gtmaybe but i also think we address a similar if not exactly the same problem in a very different way i see all of those things as related in a certain way and dont believe in separating them before critiquingbut when you dont separate them you also run the risk of creating false dichotomies just like you accused me and another user of doing not every situation is the same and most if not every situation needs to be conveyed with a bit of nuance nuance is important so we dont justify sin but so that we dont point out sin where there is none eithergtthe same reason saying not all white peoplemenstraightciscops is a bad thing i believe in examining and critiquing an in group before drawing lines because while the statement is technically true it is also a very useful tool for abdicating responsibility and opportunity to make change that is bigger than just the few good applesi was thinking of those situations too however this is a different case in those cases people are abdicating responsibility it is not necessarily the case for good christians and you cant assume that you can say not all christians while also taking the opportunity to make a change as well those statements are only bad because those same people are abdicating responsibility but they are not the same situations those ones have to do with politics or other systemic factors that cause people to not take responsibility with christians it is our moral duty to not abdicate responsibility and i am clearly not doing that as are other churches i know or attend you shouldnt put someone is intentions before the act if someone like me is saying they dont condone the actions of the pastor they clearly are abdicating for change it is never okay to paint everything with a broad brush instead just tell people not to abdicate responsibility directly even if they consider themselves a morally superior christiangtit is also an almost definite guarantee that the people who are doing good and who have the most opportunity to make change will never escape stigma or a bad reputationpeople that are doing good can never escape from stigma and having a bad reputation either because people generalize either way  the problem with your statement is that youre not helping the situation when you create this false dichotomy that either people say not all christians and dont work for change or people bash everything without clear lines and work for change you can do both look at this church herehttpswwwchristianpostcomnewsdanielimpaglianewyorkcitypastorcaughtstealingmoneychurchofferingninetimesclaimswasntpaidenough154184 for example the people there are clearly rebuking him or take this article for example herehttpsallafricacomstories201812120566html this herehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlyfzsfu6s48 this herehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9fapqv8fydc this guy addresses the problem here herehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjmyhvxvwuq0 even this pastor makes a sermon about it herehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlo5v27zkh7s francis chan is also a church leader that addresses this problem look him up on youtube herehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvetkftuipaxs even an example from my own life is my dad who always addresses hypocritical behavior as a man of god in the churchgti dont believe christianity is exempt from that and i think being honest about how issues flow through even good christians is the first step in attracting the people god calls to his church even if they dont or cant connect with a churchi dont think christianity is exempt from criticism either but there is a difference between criticizing the issues in the church and then dragging the church for your own benefit or for karma you can correct people is misconceptions at the same time like the people who have misconceptions about your pastor and those good christians are the ones working to take care of their issues in the first place not every christian has the same wants needs or goals obviously every christian is prone to issues but the ones in the videos or links i posted above are working to educate people and overcome that issue do you see white peoplecis mencops doing the same thing read part 2 here since my comment was too longhttpswwwredditcomrblackladiescommentsa71ct2megachurch_pastor_john_gray_defends_200kec57mv4
723	1	good luck to you it took me 25 years to get this little one i really didnt think it was gonna happen naturally and even tho fertility treatments up to ivf are covered here in toronto im still glad it worked out naturally ill be 30 this month im very grateful i pray it works out for you it did for me just as i lost hope
724	1	i mean so youre gonna limit free speech
725	1	same if anything i say this to my hubs im like you just want your cream all over this chocolate beauty or some freaky stuff all the time and he blushes and smacks my butt ive never had someone white say this to me actually i think only black dudes have said freaky stuff like this to me
726	1	to be honest thats expected right id be surprised if any country or anyone for that matter does something without expecting something in return china is not doing this out of good heart no one would be anyway
727	1	true i have enough auntsunclescousins with lighter coloring i always thought it was the white ancestors coming through
728	1	congrats again
729	1	lmao ignoring race gender and class you still gotta be more than just a good writer shit aint a meritocracy
730	1	im aware of that and we are allowed to be ourselves and disparage them
731	1	mandatory participation in politics rubs me the wrong waywhile i encourage us to engage our elected officials and scrutinize the funky legislation do it because you want to and the best way to rope people in is by giving them the facts and showing how it could work for them i agree with your ideapolitics in many ways is local it is easy to point out who those folks arethey live up the street or across town
732	1	httpsjezebelcomlenadunhamapologizesforrejectingtherapeallegatio1820584050they dont have a history of letting her slide im sure itll be mentioned
733	1	ill be honest here there is a lot going on in your reply and im not sure i get or understand what youre trying to say
734	1	i agree that is why the statistics and arguments about how most black men date or marry black women dont help as much as people think they do because they raise the question of which black women considering the large range of black in the us and we all know which primarily
735	1	yeah that might be the case youre right this is why i try to keep a distance if they feel comfortable with you and think youre too nice they start asking you embarrassing questions that seem too personal like my boss does ask you for favors but dont know you very well like this one lady at my workplace or get too touchy like some of those people did
736	1	so im finding out
737	1	gtand so far we really push all these negative stories and ignore all the things we can doas much as i appreciate the point youre making i think we do more than most people in celebrating and acknowledging the things we can do and overcome in relation to what we face we have some of the most positive mindsets out there but i think as a group and aside from very real mental health stigmas black people have some of the healthiest coping mechanisms out there
738	1	a lot of the reasons we have poorer health outcomes even when adjusted for socioeconomic factors in america is due to the stress of our environment  stress causes a release of cortisol high levels of cortisol cause systemic health problems
739	1	exactly how did that make it less meaningful people always acting like their racists opinions are all that matter
740	1	ugh you are right it is hard to fight it and so true about the second hand embarrassment i also do agree light skin is privilege but all these light skin vs dark skin videos lately have been upsetting me thanks for your replyampx200b
741	1	i didnt know that makes sense
742	1	amen
743	1	ive always wondered this as well at least he seems to take care of all 18 million of them wish id see him photographed with angel iris his daughter with mel b more often also he makes really good looking kids the jury is out on the two newest ones but there isnt a dud in the rest of the bunch
744	1	how is beto going to win nationally when he couldnt even beat ted cruz of all people
745	1	its sad because theyre very entitled because theyre raised that theyre better than minorities and no one wants to check that statement irl no one wants to risk their job
746	1	even when you tell them they cant grasp it when white people try to push past me i become a statue they can fall right over if they want to be rude
747	1	if you know that he wants to marry you asking him can happen right
748	1	who was it
749	1	100 agree with this post
750	1	i guess thatll have to do his job separates us quite a bit so its normal for us to be apart plus we spent the first six months of our relationship apart so to me it doesnt seem like it would make that much of an impact but what youre saying is hes too comfortable correct
751	1	i wish

753	1	has she taken well to you being vegan
754	1	first of all i didnt make a comment about the way she carried herself  the way she spoke not her skin tonemorphing into whiteness means to try to assimilate into white culture which is basically white supremacy girl i got diverse friends to and who gives a fuck also i didnt ask for the sob light skin story that aint nothing compared to what darker skinned black girls go through so you can go ahead with that and my way of thinking isnt backwards because i find it strange to actively and voluntarily surround yourself with white people im just going on based on what my bf told me because he knows her better than i do and seeing her for myself she is cool but i dont really vibe with her and thats ok i was also told that i spoke white i went to all white schools public and catholic i lived in a diverse neighbourhood too after katrina and i am lighter skinned black girl as well but im not a tragic light skinned tho and you may have been made fun of for speaking white but you know damn well you got more praises for not acting black so miss me with that bullshit

774	1	how sway
775	1	nope i dont know if its innate or it is a result of the steady stream of tumblr i consumed when i was younger but i am really really drawn to gay male story arcs i find it cute and hot at the same time doesnt hurt that connor is quite the looker

785	1	gtsome guys do see me as beautiful  it is mostly important that i see it in myself first this is so true im glad you realize you need to see it in yourself first
786	1	white guys fetishize the fuck outta asian women its actually the most prominent interracial pairing  asian women and white men the intentions are not wholesome the majority of the time
787	1	im from zimbabwe and when i lived in england a white work colleague referred to me as coloured which surprised me because in zim a coloured person is a mixed race person and i definitely dont look mixed race as i kept talking to her and she kept using other descriptors l actually had to say to her you do realise that its not racist to call me black right it was really odd

794	1	they have themselves and their lives their families are an extension of themselves to these type of men
795	1	silence is also a choice i think bringing it up to your friends will be helpful if it goes well they will do better next time if they get angry or defensive then you dont need to be around them anymore because theyve shown you how they really are
796	1	that is exactly what i thought too im dark enough to get in but idk if i would want to subject myself to that if i was interested im not i have no clue who she is
797	1	they dab at rallies the cognitive dissonance is real
798	1	gt it reminds me of politicians who wrap themselves in the flag and cupcheck people is patriotismyep and the fact that he was so quick to spend time with trump just makes me think he is cut from the same cloth im very familiar with how the finances of churches work and know pastors who could be doing things close to this but dont gray is behavior is a huge problem in any context
799	1	that is my bil is alma materi hear you on making friends that is been my experience at work too there is so few of us and it draws everyone closer out of necessitysomebody asked him can you be woke given who you date that spurred furious discussion about nerds and high school dating unproductive as hell but the silver lining is a lot of people talked about how much fun they had at hbcus
800	1	cool that your experience differs from mine
801	1	i can relate its crazy how much environment and getting older and realizing things changes things  after going away to college i realized i wasnt ugly but actually really cute lmao its just that the environment at my high school was restrictive it was taboo for white guys to be interested in black girls and not seen as cool for black guys to be with a black girl and a status symbol to date a white girlthat didnt mean i was ugly it is just that kids are self absorbed and care a lot about what other people think of themits funny how a guy came out of the woodwork to confess his feelings to me just weeks before graduation i started a really fulfilling ltr and at college i get attention its weird sometimes i still feel like that invisible girl so i dont recognize male attention as being anything but friendly
802	1	that really is the worst  youre fully aware of your situation trying to keep it blurred in the background though you think about it a lot someone acknowledges it unknowingly out loud and the intensity could knock you over with a feather how are you doing these days
803	1	i dont understand how unpaid internships are even legal
804	1	unfortunately there really are black men out here supporting white supremacy in dating and using that to intentionally try to cause black women emotional pain by making these kinds of statements the self hate is real out there
805	1	if black women are upwardly mobile in any sense of that term it is despite the road blocks sojourner truth wrote about this two centuries ago black women step up because it is either that or starve black women have the highest labor force participation of all women in lay mans terms this means black women work longer hours and for more years past retirement than white women hispanic women and latinas black women also on average take the lowest wages for a single job but guess what black women also on average hold more concurrent jobs black women have the highest single mother rates so we know they are often breaking their backs because they are the sole breadwinners they are the least likely demo to be married at 26 black men by the way are at 32 which tells you a good chunk of black men are marrying outside while black women are not finding partners outside the race the upshot of these depressing stats is that black girls grow up knowing there will be no knight in shinning armor college is not an opportunity to goof off as most guys and white girls see it it is a leg up in a system designed to tear us down we rise because there is no other muthafolking choice but to rise
806	1	the fact that you dont understand how toxic you are is crazy youre part of the damn problem
807	1	gtignoring the fact that people have valid criticisms of megachurchesim not ignoring anything my responses on this particular thread line were in support of ucrasheredall original reply that all megachurches arent bad there are plenty of comments on this entire post where people are generally not happy with church in general for various reasons i havent responded on any of those because i understand their reasons and agree with some of them gt megachurches that are basically shrines to personal achievementsyou seem to have a issue with megachurches and that is okay i dont

835	1	11a1ish during work hours
836	1	youre making assumptions about why im disagreeing with you both of my parents are toxic i have a degree cum laude own a home and live comfortably my sister is a struggling single mother with no education im not comfortable saying we live drastically different lives because i worked hard and she didnt we both went through a hell of a lot im not going to look down my nose at her and say she should just be positive because nobody deserves to be minimized in that way it is not productive
837	1	it is been taken care of i think but be vigilant i looked up black ladies on reddit and this sub was being brigaded to hell and back 6 months ago and people were bashing it everywhere
838	1	me too actually now that you mention it black people with powers in general is something that i need more of in my life
839	1	well those two things are particularly mutually exclusive but you know your hubby better than any of us up in here so no smoke over here
840	1	i hate when people say that ish because i usually hear it from men and white woman especially at work cause that is the most performative space i live in on top of that shit they usually want to say and do for their own comfort only adds more to another is suffering 9 times out of 10
841	1	yes i heard this nearly every day as a child this phrase makes me cringe lol
842	1	is it because its more noticeable
843	1	i feel youmine looked like shit at first too like any style there is a learning curve at first  ive been natural for 20 years and every style ive tried has looked a mess initially until i practiced and got it right but i get not everyone wants to go through all that for every style and why bother if youve found what works for you and youre happy with it
844	1	or start one in your area
845	1	gtgthowever why do you think black kids at predominately white schools are inherently getting a better education than black kids at black schoolsgtgtare we just going to ignore segregation and redlining at least most of the time that is the case public schools particularly in my town dont seem to have the same college driven focus that the private school near my town has it is either go to an expensive private school for me or move to the richer town next door which my family couldnt afford to doyeah what your parents are doing for you is what im advocating for not against i dont think black families should keep their kids in failing public schools i think youre missing my point gtgt that is my thing most of the time the assumption that these schools are better is made simply because they are white schools and therefore must be bettergtgtthe assumption isnt because theyre white the assumption is made because of history and you can easily look up the school is programs graduation rates kids that get scholarships etc you cant assume people are just misinformed this view isnt just limited to black schools there is a great vocational school in my area that would have more black students  too but because theyre not as college driven as say the private school my parents steered clear of that school actually there is plenty of data showing that the assumptions are because theyre white to the point where it is illegal in the us for realtors to say stuff like this neighborhood has good schools because it is well documented that that is code for black people dont live here gtgt im just saying that good schools is often short hand for white schools and a cover for moving to a white areagtgtbecause in this world the good schools usually are white schools it is not because they hate black people there are relatively few areas with predominantly black people and good schools unfortunately so you have to pick and choose btw the good white schools or the bad black schools often gtsaying that good schools can be white is different that acting like white schools are good good schools can also be black im talking explicitly about black people who will move into proven mediocre white school districts for good schools but would never consider the often cheaper good black private option in a black neighborhoods it doesnt sound like that is you
846	1	i cant imagine what it does to ones self worth to be black yet not think black people are worth loving

863	1	the visuals for the track pynk gt at first glance it may seem as though monáe is stepping into cisgendercentric assumptions that only a vagina makes someone a woman or a femme yet two of the dancers in that grouping don pink bathing suits absent labia pants at one point one of them swings a pink baseball bat between their legs its a nod to the experiences of transgender and gendervariant people making it clear that gender isnt limited to genitalia and also that the bodies of marginalized people are to be celebrated not made into a cultural spectaclethats an excerpt from this article httpswwwthemusstoryjanellemonaesdirtycomputerdeliversablackfeministandqueervisionoffreedomi read or you could pm ujanellemonae and see if she replies she uses reddit too and ive always wondered if she reads this sub lol
864	1	feelings have nothing to do with it it is not possible for me to entertain personal negative feelings stemming from a post from someone on reddit where we have differing opinions that is just silly however if you are motivated to post to express your sincere feelings on the matter with a direct example like op is with the genders reversed based on an experience youve had with a black womani strongly encourage you to do so that is what a safe space if for as demonstrated with all of my responses on the topic im happy to hear you out and offer you my thoughts insight and perspective as a black woman respectfully and rationally however if you intend to post from a place of pettiness which it feels as if you intend to do as your response above feels that way i encourage you not to  as it is a waste of time is infantile and doesnt lend itself to a productive conversation on the topic happy kwanzaa and best to you edit on mobile spelling formatting wonky
865	1	gti know a few women who date for months before letting their partners see them without makeup and wigsweaves i feel women play a part in that sort of thing as welli agree with you it is definitely not a situation where the blame can be placed on a single factor

868	1	a parent can only do so much a kid is more affected by the outside world than their parents sigh  dont know the answer to this
869	1	you dont have to shame other black women to get your point across black women are hated by everyone including our own men at times so if a black woman feels hate towards black men or any other group of people because of that that is her choice and she deserves to feel that way  if you love black men however you deserve that opinion to but you shouldnt shame other black women because of how they feel
870	1	especially considering nicki minajs ass has a oddly fitting plastic ass on top theyre already not starting the comparison from a good place theres nothing lost by passing up these fuck boys
871	1	and why the asian incel community of all communities thats random is it someone that even posted here because if they post here i might have an idea
872	1	bleh reddit ate my response but tldr my cousin is like this and the seeds of his mindset were planted early even though we were raised in a majority black area went to predominantly black k12 schools etc im sure in his mind there is a totally different reasonable explanation and the family is just full of haters who dislike his wife since she is white even though my husband is white and they love him but selfdelusion is real
873	1	oh okay

883	1	thats a lie the queen has terrifying amounts of power which she chooses to not exercise she is literally above the law governments in england australia new zealand and canada cannot form without her approval and she can dissolve any of those parliaments at a whimwhether or not the people would stand for it is another story but i think they would because of the fucking fascist trends in the worldheres a brief overview of what powers she actually hashttpsyoutubewidcwqpupj8 so yeah the narrative that she doesnt actually have any power is another royalist lie to keep the power structure in place they are massively wealthy and living a life of luxury at the expense of millions in a kingdom literally built on subjugating others

887	1	wait you claim that you are all about the rights of human sex workers but you want this sex worker tried as an adult and to be held accountable for murder  make up your mind about whose side you are on if you support sex workers you should support cyntoia it seems to me that you are merely on the side of the johns here with your support for sex workers
888	1	youre making a lot of assumptions lol i know when it is pointless to continue doesnt mean i gave up my stance tho
889	1	i went into an hampm a couple months ago looking for some basic camisoles or something i dont remember what but i do remember looking around at all the crop tops and ripped jeans and giant furry coats and just thinking it all looked like a mess it really drove home that i am too damn old to be shopping at hampm that whole family of stores is dead to me lol

893	1	i suspect that is what theyre trying to prevent trump will be put out to pasture and they will act very indignant when people with any sense state that that is not good enough
894	1	sis i initially came over from rblackfellas and thinking about it i realize i could accidentally be a little man splainy i apologise though you may still call me sister if you please as my gender identity is pretty fluidi hope everyone ends up okay too but may i shed a little insight as to what how we got to trumpi was only 16 when obama was first elected but it was obvious he was causing an uproar in certain circles several political pendants usually older white men with ties to the republican party and and to fox news would spin propaganda against the manthroughout his campaign these people literally called obama a reptile they said his health care reformation would kill the elderly and his bills to conserve the environment would send the economy into plummetting and cause thousands of people to be homeless and crime rates to skyrocketi lived in los angeles california until i was 18 and had the privilege of going to college thanks to my mother is understanding of the school and city sustems that are literally designed to keep black people and immigrants poor uneducated and forever working low paying jobsin 2010 moved out of the la where there were people from all over the world to a small northern california town called arcata my school was humboldt state university even though most of the white people in arcata were nice enough it was there where i started to see who was believing the propaganda most of these people lived in the city just north of arcata mckinleyville also know as mcklanleyville due to to active ku klux klan chapter there but well come back to themnow the area surrounding my college town humboldt county is world reknowed for it is marijuana and it is the basis for the economy of these small towns homeless people poor people and marginalized people would travel to to make money farming weed and sleep in the forests or on the street as they didnt exactly have the money to rent we called them transientsthe thing it it wasnt even their faults as many of the people i went to school with  white black whatever color  didnt have the money to rent humboldt state has for a couple decades had a significant number of students living in cars or on couches in 2013 a local article said the number of homeless students was 25the reason why is because there wasnt enough work in the small town to support everyone especially in the summer when school closed and half of the city is population went home for summer break on top of that rent was rising due to the college growing many times students wound up working the weed farms just to survive i considered it but i always had a knack for getting white folks to like me i got a job on campus and opted on splitting a one bedroom with a good friendon top of this weed was and still is becoming more popular with more demand came more people coming to humboldt and more sticking around with all these poor homeless transients and came more violent crime around the city usually between transients folks but sometimes students were robbed which was normal for la but strange for this little college towni went to a thanksgiving dinner with one of my classmates in either 2013 her church was hosting i was one 3 blackbrown people in a group of 40 i connected with a few of the young men by talking about anime and video games we shared laughs and jokes as ate and cleaned up afterwards until it came around politics they were all republican i told them didnt care for parties and felt there needed to be cooperation they asked how i felt about obama citing the recent uptick in local muggings and homelessnessi tried to explain to them the above they were not receptive my explanations seemed to go over their heads so instead i asked them to cite what policy or action on obama is part they said he was damaging the economy i citied news that the economy has done nothing but flatten out and be on the rise since his first election and reelection and that nation wide crime rates are have been and are still going downthe room went cold and their stares became daggers i excused myself to restroom gathered my stuff helped put a away few more chairs so it wouldnt be super obvious and leftthe fact is the obama or any president doesnt really have control over tiny things like the crime rate for a single town but the only things they people saw was more crime and more homeless people just like the angry white men on tv told them aboutfunny thing is the violent crime from the transients covered up the fact that black native american and latin students were getting chased by trucks two black friends of mine were  chased and had eggs thrown at them being called niggers and bitches another native friend of mine had a pickup truck accelerate towards her and her two friends as they crossed at a stop sign fortunately she escaped with only a fractured leg from what i remember there at least two other instances of this and this was in 2015 when obama is second term was coming to a closeas my roomie and i lead a march that wound up going straight to the president of the school about we didnt organized it but we had been kicking it with native folks so they trusted usalright lemme stop

896	1	thank you for this i agree with this completely ofcourse black is a culture  a very rich culture with it is own history language and behavior it is with this respect that i felt odd agreeing with people identifying me as black just as would a foreigner identifying with kikuyu my culture i dont mean to be too simplistic i have no response to being called a black woman without feeling like a fraud a little bit
897	1	i dont have an issue with old people being onlinebut im not checking for them as romantic partnershoteps are people who are all about we were all kings let is go back to ancient egypt umair johnson dudes

905	1	a long time ago okcupid did a little experiment where they had users rate the attractiveness of different people then they divided that data by race and had a comparison of what constitutes a 7 for example across races and what was striking was that you had this hotasshit black girl or latina girl rated the same as an extremely average white girl
906	1	wellsaid
907	1	theres an episode on a podcast called death sex and money where a white woman talk about how much she steals she would steal and sell the stuff later i think she was shameless
908	1	this happened to me at target as well a black male security guard was on my tail the entire time i was clearly the only person being watched because im black he was so bold following on me on every aisle it was disgusting and i left and  didnt buy anything that day i made sure to call and tell off the manager which they made up some excuseneedless to say it happens everyday and only getting worse i dont bring my purse into stores as much as i used to because of being followed and stared at i just carry my pocketbook with my cards its sad i have to do that but i dont need the stress
909	1	the old mans facial expressions
910	1	exactly i addressed this in my comment
911	1	you absolutely are comparing outcomes for black men and black women and you are doing it while blatantly ignoring all context and coming to some really strange conclusions regarding where the privilege lies you also dont seem to see that placing responsibility for black men on black womens backs is not novel this is as it is always been the culture enshrines it in ride or die anthems since your metrics are on the criminal justice system let is get a few things straight 1 blm was founded by three black women deray shawn and the rest of the men came on board after they had gained traction once they came on board the men is issues were fully centred to the detriment of the women for example one of the big talking points early on was the sexual assault inflicted on black women by arresting officers it mysteriously disappeared from the platform they shifted the movements ideological foundations in other ways too which made has imo weakened it and made it an easier target for right wingers 2 women face incarceration challenges too most notably the sentencing disparity evidenced between black and white men also exists between black and white women 3 black women are far more likely to experience gender based violence than any other race or sex the vast majority of their attackers are their intimate partners who happen to be almost exclusively black men this has to be said because conversations like this can guilt black women for sending their attackers where they belong not every black guy in prison is just a poor victim of the system we need to be careful not to coddle men who exhibit toxic masculinity you want to know how to deal with the men in your life teach them about intersectionality teach them about male entitlement teach them to empathy for women remind them the world will grind on with or without them and most importantly teach them its not the black woman is job to nurse the world like some 1950s marmie
912	1	gt reducing the ministry of god to professional sport i saw that
913	1	black women empowerment it is been out for11 years now helps black women who are victims of misogynoir become powerful in their own lives concerning career family femininity and how you become the vision you want to see in the world when it comes to men choose character over color that last sentence has brought so much attention to their cause look at christelyn karazin and youll see what im talking about you can type up pretty much anything black women related on facebook im in the black women traveling groups not all of them but just a few the world is your oyster
914	1	i live 3045 minutes outside of a big city not really any meetups in my area i should probably look for meetups in the city and go there
915	1	cthe context i left out is that my classmates and neighbors received porsches and mercedes  and acuras on their sixteenth birthdays i had to beg for a car of my own in high school  most of my peers had traveled the western hemisphere already most of them had servents  some had drivers all their own until they were old enough to drive  some had the authority to fire employees there were enough people like that around that they seemed normal and average also their parents were friends of my family and were always complaining about how expensive things wereas such i felt ultra poor  i knew two families who appeared to have less but that was it they were probably really average those kids had student loans their parents couldnt just give them

921	1	gt did no one teach them treat others how you want to be treated this isnt taught practiced or works in america for women minorities or immigrants the whole of society is complicit including black people because most of society envies even when they hate dubious people like weinstein or crosby that is why this is such a capitalist society where the end justifies any means as long as the cause feels right
922	1	gt the point of the gospel is to bring as many people to jesus as possible  that is all a mega church is doingi dont think this is true the whole concept of a megachurch points not just to a church with a lot of members but large expensive buildings expensive branding and usually highpaid pastors and possibly staff i dont believe pastors should be poor or that a church shouldnt be able to accommodate large numbers of people but most megachurches go way beyond that
923	1	please do share
924	1	salary negotiation edit  i will create a new thread for professional development but i wanted to share here because it was requestedi  be prepared to job hunt every single day2 quantify the value of each accomplishments 3 your network is your networth per porter gayle this is everyone you know even a little bit4 get at least two mentors internally and externally one should be your racegendermaybe sexual orientation and one who is not5 get a sponsor  sometimes a mentor might convert but dont count on it6 this isnt like passage or victorian courtship where you wait to be chosen this is a hookup where you state what you want or never ever get itthis is how you set yourself up for salary negotiationthe bottom line is quantify the value of everything you do at work  this must br exhaustive for example if there is something only you do like handle a certain set of clients arrange meetingsparties training  point out it has value or cuts cost and by how much talk up how much time this requires  point out if you have valuable professional relationships that enable you dont share with whom to accomph these thingscheck what youre being paid in your local area versus the average for that area ask for about 5 above the average if you are being paid aboveyou have to approach your request a certain way set up a meeting point out your three most shining and recent accomplishments  share what average salarywage is for that locally  point out what you make including base and bonus and that it is below ask is there is some issue behind the wage deficit that you can adjust  furthermore ask your boss what they are willing to do to get you caught up on compensationmeanwhile be willing to walk before you do this  have an executive onepager ready you dont need to be an executive to use this because this is what youre going to present to your boss anyway  research any and all contacts online linkedin and facebook to see who hires a significant number of alumi from any of your alma maters as well as any of your employers  find connections even if you have to cross reference with facebook pals  set up brunch  more realistically happy hour or coffeedessert with a friend from that company on your dime if it is a good pal then invite them over to dinner say you want to know what it is like to work there  then ask them who to talk to at their company they know personally request a warm introduction for another get together on your dime happy hour or if you find out about this persons hobbies you can take them ice skating or something  invite your direct connection too if you can   the key is that youre making soft inroads to multiple employers you dont necessarily need to jump shop asap but start this while preparing your onepager focus on three companies  cross reference with glassdoor if you canwhen you meet with your boss listen for what they are not saying  a pal of mine eventually realized her dreds were the only thing keeping her out of the next level she had two mentors one who looked like her and one who didnt the one who did flat out said she needed to stop being bohemian and look more corporate eg perm and suits the one who didnt would talk around it but made it clear hed love to help move her into the organization and listed her alternatives until room could be made for her she had to figure it out thoughmy experience was eye opening i work for a large company and not at hq and didnt work in the same office as my boss he swears he didnt know how little i made for the san francisco area id come from san diego  he fixed it however he asked me to give him some ammo he told me to get satisfied clients to tell him how fabulous i was meanwhile he put me on higher profile projects that is how he fixed it i was literally meeting with his boss more than he was because of one of those projects  he  had a high a profile project he wanted to cash in on so he had me sit in for a month  he would come in late to his own staff meetings im sure he was just checking on me to be happily relieved that i had covered all hos interests and requirements  this built respect for me among my teammates   he really went the extra mile once i demonstrated that i had been doing that and knew i was a catch
925	1	gtthey dont have a history of letting her slide im sure itll be mentioned
926	1	gti will be forthcoming with my future partners because i know not speaking up is what got me here in the first place not necessarily majority of people about 80 with hsv dont show symptoms and therefore do not know they have it so it could be that whoever you got it from truly didnt know despite getting tested regularly since herpes isnt on your standard sti screening
927	1	im pretty much the same way ill usually sit through it if the story peaks my interest the fact that movie comes out the weekend right after my birthday i might treat myself
928	1	you really shouldnt put buying a private plane in the same league as screwing everyone in the church you seem to have some hang ups with churches but you need to remember that churches are not a monolith there are plenty of churches that have to go the extra mile for their congregation so they dont lose members or look bad and never receive any appreciation its only in cases like these when people are the loudest or give the most attention a private jet can be useful for many things if the church has a lot of staff and constant events in places throughout the country and world it might not be feasible to take a commercial airline especially because of delays or inconvenience i do think a pastor has to be cautious of how much the private jet is make sure that the mission of the church is promulgated more through the procurement of the private jet inform the congregation of how and when it will be used and about how many jets they need they also dont need a jet with a private bathtub and 100 bathrooms im exaggerating it you get my point
929	1	so sorry miscarriages do hurt

932	1	neither do i my mom loves him and we kind of make fun of he for it
933	1	why do you feel guilty
934	1	lol nope the one experience that sums up my childhood and is one of my clearest memories was once when i was 7 or 8 my best friend at the timehe name was claire and short of albinos she is one of the whitest people i have ever seen to this day and i used to dress up as twins we used to buy out clothes together from head to toe one day i wore the wrong shoes and when i saw her she said how will people know were twins if our shoes dont match and it dawned on me years later that when we decided we wanted to be twins our races were never a factor not by either of us not by teachers not by other students and not by our parents who took us to get our twin outfits to us wearing the same clothing made us twins plain and simplethe only time race really came up was once in middle school there was this sikh kid said something rude to me about my skin colour and i went off on him i told him stuff a long the lines of this is who i am and i have no shame surrounding what i look like and i love it and how would he feel if someone made fun of his religion at that point he accused me of making fun of his religion head desk and i checked out to this day im not going to waste my breath on people who wont listenthe first time i personally felt different was a few years ago when i was in my mid 20 is and saw how my industrycomedian and actor was largely made up of white men and that put everyone else at a disadvantage but that never even came as a surprise to me ive always grown up knowing that what i had was really good but i knew it wouldnt last forever so when that happened my first and only thought was cool what can i do to change this but that transition as you might call it just felt natural i never felt culture shock or anything as someone else in the comments mentioned and to this day it is something i am proud to say i actively fight forand now i days i have a signifiant amount of friends who are poc and i have dated people who arent white but i never feel significantly different when im with them then when im with my white friends and thankfully a lot of the people i am friends with are all friends with one another so i dont really have a group of white friends or poc friends i just have a group of friendsall this being said i am grateful that i have never felt shame for being who i am that growing up people rarely made me feel uncomfortable in my skin i remember bringing trini food for my grade school class and being so happy about it and my love for who i am has only grown from there but i recognize that this isnt everyone is story so many things factored in to my upbringing by pure chance and they just worked really well together it was like i lived in a bubble but the bubble was clear as day i always knew i was in the bubble but i could still see the world for what it was and knew exactly what the world might see of me
935	1	well i only say the pretty white girls as the people in high school always prioritized their feelings over everyone else i even remember one time this black girl was crying in my art class like literally bawling silent tears not those nosy tears and no one even asked her if she was alright i know she is pretty because people would always tell her how she was very pretty for a black girl yet no one even bothers asking what was wrong with her yet the white girls of course barely shed a tear or mention some half ass sad attempt my teacher failed me sniff sniff and everyone went out of their way to help these were just observations ive noticed in high school since i was never pretty i could understand me not getting that sympathy card but i always saw it with the pretty black girls as well not trying to discredit what you said but just pointing out my viewpoint on this
936	1	oh my goodness i love this thank you for your kind words
937	1	more reddit magic thanks for the tip i had no idea about this
938	1	thank you im glad to hear it what did you end up doing after graduation

941	1	ugh youre also right
942	1	thank you i hate how this subreddit just wallows in the negativity there is a lot of internalized oppression here the negative pessimistic attitude in our community is holding us back even more how can we succeed if we dont take risks because we assume we cant do anything
943	1	why would they lie about it tho i mean if they told me would it be true what would they lie like that for by sayingi liked you
944	1	oh yikes talk about converting the hate you receive into hate that you send out to others huh
945	1	yeah that was really uncalled for she is my first look into the diaspora war
946	1	that is what it seems like im thinking about ordering the purple and the gold i have 4c hair and it even looked good on the kinky hair
947	1	im kenyan and im not gonna lie i was very unpleasantly surprised when i heard about this trademark lots of kenyans online had the same sentiment when the story broke i think theres a big difference between cultural appreciation and appropriation  and this seems like the latter hakuna matata was popularized years before lion king by the kenyan band them mushrooms in their 1982 hit song jambo bwana and it basically became our tourism anthem im fine with disney borrowing from african culture and im a sucker for lion king but them turning around and trying to legally own a swahili phrase leaves a bitter taste in my mouth
948	1	yes live that
949	1	thats kevins own version on an apology  to be honest though aside from kevin i feel as though when people get caught in this type of situation even if they gave a genuine apology people still wouldnt let it go even if a person like you or me said we were sorry for mistakes weve made people still wouldnt let it go
950	1	lmfaooo this is it ive traveled internationally with my friend who moved 1000 miles away and we find great deals and hostel up etc my other friends see me hanging with her and are all like you should travel with me i wanna go somewhere with you etc yet these are the same people who want to have a luxury vacation and dont want to stay in an airbnb or hostel ive stayed in good hostels in brooklyn toronto and amsterdam and they are turned off when i tell them that im not spending that much to travel as a recent college grad sis lol i can have the same experience on a budget but yes these friends make more than me and buy expensive things all the time but dont have a passport
951	1	i get that i just dont see the strength of the religion made me do it argument
952	1	yea i get that some people are into it i just find the larger implications to be a problem it would have been different if it was a black royal family but this is the family that is related to the biggest colonizersdid some colonizing themselves and now they control her i find it sad others clearly find it romantic
953	1	oh no they were very honest about how ugly and unstylish i was i just always assumed i was just average but hearing people talk about how ugly you were while praising some other women is ass or face was disheartening even if i wasnt interested in those men but you know men influence others so the other women ended developing egos and such and agreed i wasnt much to look at well i have few friends and theyre all married i never see them anymore because of that but maybe im hoping once they get a few years into their marriage well spend more time together but i always hear people say how married women and single women cant be friends because their worldview is so vastly different i like to think my worldview isnt that far off that we cant still spend time i mean im not like sex and the city women hooking up every other night but again ill have to see they may end up having children  1 is already pregnant and i may never see them much anymore so im basically alone at this point im trying to meet more people and friends but it is difficult for some reason
954	1	uthelittleslurmaid you crazy living single is light years beyond girlfriends girlfriends sucksand ueleahey you crazy too because serena williams is my spirit sister she is the best ever at tennis arguably she is the best athlete in any sport of all time and she most certainly is not fake

956	1	honestly i think its because we are taking care of business in many other areas youd normally work on our education levels and careers are increasingly on point more and more black women are traveling etc whats left someone to keep you warm at night and probably exercise and mental health i also believe its because we crave to be protected like any other race of women and the absence of that is pretty loud in a socially constructive way already in our personal lives its screaming so im not sure if its too focused on but when youre kicking ass in almost every other area youre probably out there coming across a lot of foolishness which is one of the more entertaining although frustrating parts of life its good to share
957	1	ya hispanic just means they speak spanish since they were colonized by the spanish at some point you can find people who are literally almost all spanish in some parts of central america and south america but theyre still latino same how you can be almost all of african descent and be afrolatino latino is a broad term when ya think about itedit to add examples like this are kinda why the descriptor of white isnt always too clear in the us we use it to refer from people who like like they are descendents from europe but it can get complicated in other countries same with black at times
958	1	you have to hold up a paper with your  name written on it which i think is pretty troll proof
959	1	my best friend is white when i told her about the way blacks are treated in a lot of restaurants she really didnt believe me i pointed out to her that every time we went out to eat i always let her take the lead so the hostessesservers thought she was paying we always go dutch or take turns paying i still remember the look on her face when she realized i did that so i told her next time ill take lead and watch what happens sure enough the waitress at red robin tried to seat us near bathrooms after walking us through a half empty restaurant of course i corrected the servers idea about where we were going to sit but the look on my white friends face was priceless that was the day she finally took off her rose tinted glasses and started doing her own research  i didnt know about redlining she taught me about it
960	1	the sad part is that the people who are defending him will never benefit from him at all it reminds me of when creflo dollar was crowdfunding another private jet so many people defended him vehemently smh
961	1	literally i dont like when christians like her feel like they have to overcompensate and almost bash their own religion and followers in a way yes the church has problems but that is not representative of the millions of churches even megachurches around the world and if someone has a a problem with one church they can simply find another one it is not hard

977	1	gt watch brazilian youtubers so i can train my ears to recognize the portuguese language  this is such a good idea
978	1	it is your specific experience that the negatives were only in your head that is not everyone is experience if you formed beliefs based on stories you heard that is fine but other people formed beliefs based on their actual experiences it is way harder to believe you can do something when youre constantly recieving feedback that you cant or that it will be extraordinarily difficult for example your name may not get your resumes automatically dismissed in the same way someone else is might
979	1	girl its an anonymous rant posted on an internet forum let people talk about their experiences you can know all about self worth and self love while still ranting about negative experiences jesus christ

990	1	so if the majority of writers are white and male would you then agree that white men are the best writers because i dont
991	1	okay yes i hate that ugh
992	1	no problem and sorry if i came off as rude this isnt a grammar or proper english issue though you can call someone a bitch or worse and still be using perfect english just like you can be respectful of us and break every grammar and spelling rule out there female is just a small step down from bitch in any dialect especially in situations where men get to be men it is just a term that people who think less of black women frequently use and a big red flag
993	1	i think it is spoiler heavy it showed more than i would have liked
994	1	ive had black women ask me if my relaxed hair was real
995	1	not necessarily people just associate mega churches with big business and greed which is what jesus spoke out against in the first place
996	1	gt boys are notorious time wasters at those agesthis op it sounds harsh and younger me wouldnt listen to this but if i could wind back the clock knowing this truth i would have ignored every male under 25 and many of them under 30 until 25 most young men are focused on setting themselves up its easier and cheaper for them to sleep around or date for a few months and move on if even that
997	1	yeah wash and go is definitely a misnomer that only creates false expectations no one with curly hair over 3 inches can do a true wash and go unless they dont care about tangling whether youre a type 3 or 4 after a certain length its wash apply styling products and diffuseair dryuse a hooded dryer really only folks with straight or short hair can literally wash and go since tangling is less of an issue with that hair typelength
998	1	haha thank you never that though i just got my mom into lace fronts and she got the dome piece  its all about the hair line and choosing the right wig for your head shape
999	1	who is it

1001	1	some of these members walking to church
1002	1	gt baller rapper or whateverso baller and rappers are the only people who can drive lambos who made that rulei know that sounds facetious and i totally get the general point everyone here is making but my question is where is the line here and who decides what the line is he said he didnt use the churches money do you want me to tell you what to spend your money on gtit is disgusting how many people do not even know what the rolemeaning of a pastor should be pastor shouldnt be driving a lambo having a private plane using church funds to buy the new xbox or creeping around fucking everyone in the church i agree with this except the xbox lol like it is a 300 game system but seriously i can have an xbox but a pastor cant why i can drive a benz but a pastor cant please someone show me the verse specifically where it says pastors specifically and not all followers of christ are supposed to be poor i really hate playing devil is advocate here no pun intended and i know the church has real issues im gay so i know but people pick in choose what to be offended over when it comes to church like you said half the people who think this is the worse thing ever probably is cool with a deacon sleeping with every single woman in the church again the optics are bad and he probably shouldnt have thought more about it but if it aint the church money he spending somebody show me some biblical support for him being dead wrong
1003	1	sis you need to get in on it lol it is not too late man im telling you so dont look up where its derive from if they are white surnames you might to take a look at all the folks who had last names in that area then look to see if they had slaves look and see if theyre neighbors or other blacks who could know your family last names might to track down some graveyards my family own a graveyard mixture of indian and african folks one of your family may have migrated there was enslaved on their own land like mine or was forced to relocate
1004	1	also quotas are illegal it is almost as if what is really going on has been extremely distorted by the vitriolic attitudes and misinformed views of white supremacists controlling the narrative
1005	1	i dont think there is a wrong or right way to answer this question thanks for sharing hope you do find a way to fill the void
1006	1	the squad did a boogie day we got boozy brunch then went to the modern art museum then went dancing at night i had a shmancy dinner with an appetizer and a salad and an entre and prosecco never spent that much at a restaurant before it felt v fancy i also got tickets to a crazy nye situation

1008	1	gt
1009	1	i thought you meant her husband her dating advice still stands and im skeptical of the motives and ally status of any man who feels the need to try to shift the conversation when black men are told to treat women better
1010	1	buy them from ebay cuz ut more trusted than other websites    this is the link httpswwwebaycomitmmcckleanklebootswomenplatformhighheelsbuckleshoesthickheelshortboot273597932996pagecif5618a6f161a4273b89b2c4756670556
1011	1	okay im sure a lot of people will appreciate thisi also hate linkedin with a passion but well save that rant for another day the good news is that everybody and their mama is on there so it is easier to pinpoint who you need to talk tothank you for sharing and all the best to you
1012	1	im not deflecting i just feel like it doesnt even need to be said that the way you present yourself can say a lot whether you like it or not no all men shouldnt assume that a woman showing cleavage is looking for a relationship where exactly did i say that do you want to continue acting like you lack very basic social understanding or are we done here im not going to explain something that is very obvious to a wide range of people you can stay clueless by yourself tbh
1013	1	i remember these two women we met at the dentist asked my mom about africa one invoked the hut thing and then another who was probably trying to sound smart or thought she sounded smart said no thats only in the villages i mean theres suburbs and rural area and cities just like everywhere else  even the poorer areas in nigeria dont have huts lol even though they do exist and its nothing to be ashamed about either like you implied and yeah sorry about that people are dumb
1014	1	apparently funds are from his book deal and tv show he is not the lead pastor at least in houston he flies between houston and north carolina i think to preach i disagree with posting the gift online but i suspect it is one of those i messed up big time gifts you know those gifts where the larger the fck up the bigger the price tag
1015	1	friday after next totally counts and is lowkey my fav of the three
1016	1	im glad im not crazy but im sorry this happens to you too based on your other comment about trying to get into med school it seems like you have a lot going on for you so hopefully you can take some solace in that some random waiter with an attitude problem doesnt deserve to have that kind of impact on you
1017	1	exactly this is the problem with nonbelievers some christians and members of various congregations a church needs basic needs to function you need tvsprojectors computers instruments wifi heat electricity food etc as i said in another comment no ones going to be in the mood to accept the word of god when their basic physiological and psychological needs are not met these same people complaining about churches spending would complain if the space of the church was too cramped if there werent enough chairs if the church was infested with rats if the environment was unappealing and unwelcoming and more maintaining and attracting members isnt just about preaching its about realizing that these people are humans that can come and go at any time the pastor is the only one that has a commitment to the church if theres even one tiny thing wrong with the church then people can stop coming and the pastor wont be able to fulfill his mission churches need money to function thats how theyre able to give back to their communities and the needy it doesnt come from thin air if the church was cold or they didnt provide food for the members no one would want to come and people would complain that the church is cheap and greedy the pastor also needs to look presentable and be charismatic for people to listen to him people think christians are judgmental but its society that is overly judgmental and churches especially mega churches are only trying to account for that and make people more comfortable in a welcoming environment external appearances matter
1018	1	i get more and more frustrated with it do we have a discord for this subreddit does anyone know

1024	1	okay ima make a post similar title and lay out similar issues lets see how you feel
1025	1	this is a good suggestion however two of my favorite things to do are attending nba games and concerts so its kind of hard to make friends in these environments  for me anyway im not very outgoing however i did just join a gym so maybe ill take some classes and try to meet people there i also have a horrible case of rbf which doesnt help at all
1026	1	she cant exactly help the fact that shes been traumatized obviously there should be a level of trust between partners but its not as if parents dont abuse their own children this literally happened to her if you were robbed at gunpoint in a dark alleyway  would you not be somewhat wary afterwards of dark alleyways women dont have mind reading powers someone can seem perfectly normal and be a serial rapist so its not exactly fair to blame her for being wary even if it comes off as paranoia
1027	1	yeah after he told me that i couldnt ever join the army just the mistreatment really made me upset like i said im not judging other blacks who join but me myself i cant be part of it
1028	1	heck yeah the parks are nice lots of amenities you name it im glad for them and you tooill bump into people when theyre walking their dogs or sitting outside pleasantries are exchanged i live in the city though
1029	1	when i say time we look at the macro in his case that is 911 war and so on my knowledge of bush is limited because i wasnt an adult during his presidencybush has dirt on him but it is not trump is level of dirt so when people look back comparatively he wasnt that bad will help them overlook some of the seedier things during his terms
1030	1	cubans can be white though aka bella thorne if theyre white passing that just means theyre likely white hispaniclatino
1031	1	black lightning isnt based on his personal life

1034	1	lol i caught so much shit with this so i cant even imagine if you brought out colorism
1035	1	gt really big reach there i never brought up morals i just said im tired of it we shouldnt even focus on itnot a big reach when youre getting on a giant soapbox and trying to police what people saygtall day it is just who wont date black women and why they wont date black women none of it matters why focus on people that hate you general you therebecause it helps the black women out there that think something is wrong with them someone with my skin tone or your skin tone might see this and go hmm maybe im not the problem after all as i also said they can also get warning flags to avoid these men theyre not off in their own corner somewhere they are in our schools churches companies etc we cant ignore it gti feel like that is another issue and should honestly be discussed more than the same ol tired black males wont date us shitdid you not see people telling them to go address it on the male subreddit but i do agree that we can discuss both however were human and were not going focus perfectly on every issue but saying this is more productive than saying not to focus on it at all gtthat stuff is said here in this subredditas i said you can make a thread about it
1036	1	as told by ginger was my favourite show when i was younger
1037	1	yeah precisely and put much better than i did
1038	1	i sincerely hope nobody died
1039	1	oh wow that is a whole vulva right there
1040	1	i didnt like july suffering but i feel like it was to appease the audience when the majority of people in her situation wouldnt have a had a happy ending i know it is historical fiction but i didnt view it as escapism like most fiction i readwatch i viewed it more as history which is probably why i didnt think it should have the happy ending it did
1041	1	look up thuggizzle molested on youtube or thuggizzle behind the music i also found alot of his great work on facebook by typing in thuggizzle or thuggizzle cares in the search bar he seems to have multiple community pages and groups for his causes i also found out that he has a 501c3 tax exempt entitled thuggizzle cares inc i just donated through facebook nonprofits
1042	1	so truethere may be a tiny bit of mixing generatipms agobut one of the best products for me is mixxed chicksi need to shampoo or cowash every other day or sotangling only happens if i need a trimi am not ethnically ambiguous in the leasttldr  porosity matters more than type when it comes to selecting products and techniques and there is more than one typing scale loisedit is your hair drenching wet in these photos if not it will be much harder for us to help you with typing

1045	1	true
1046	1	gt it is not your job to play protector or referee or upstanding friend in situations i felt a bit terrible as i read this cause all i could think was i wouldnt put myself in this situation for a white woman friend and all she will have back up no one will blame her she has protectors if something happened to op people would say she started it or some other bullshitgt that means you stay in whatever place is safestsuper agree stay in a crowded place and call someone instead of putting yourself in danger a lot of bartenders are actually nice and will call security to walk you to your car
1047	1	denzel is so fine in that movie
1048	1	im on my way home so ill post one in about 45mins
1049	1	apparently there is dudes who believe that guys who go down are actually in the closet gays im not kidding had some dude say that to me on reddit oncei dont know what the logic behind that was he explained it i just couldnt make sense of iti basically think there is dudes who wanna have sex with women the same way they masturbate quick to start quick to finish and nothing that would make him feel insecureout of his comfort zone such as a decent fingerjob andor oralthey basically want a fleshlight that also makes them sandwishes cause apparently they find that too complicated as wellweird how those guys struggle to get a gf right
1050	1	gt my husband and i talk about the need to buy a house in a nice school district but it irks me because that means our children will grow up around fewer black people it is difficult to find that balancei have never felt lonelier than in the northern suburbs and i was simply passing through the winnetkas of the world have nice homes but good god almighty it is white whiteonly state ive heard people say worse things is louisiana there is something weird down thereeditthis just popped into my mind you know how there is the whole buy the block movement i cant remember where but i recall hearing about developers slowly scooping up real estate in poor neighborhoods and holding these like investments theyre waiting until the neighborhood flips and the current residents priced out
1051	1	but they voluntarily pay taxes arent they so generous s
1052	1	youre definitely right on that and it has no placestance on where she was raised i stand corrected and apologize
1053	1	ok but none of your other concerns were included in the original post so im only responding about the car
1054	1	lol exactly i mean my mom always did my hair or i would go get my hair done but now that im almost a whole ass adult with a toddler i cant really afford to go get my hair done every 2 weeks  so its definitely the struggle lol
1055	1	girl byethe notation that people shouldnt be offended by offensive things is dumb
1056	1	ive been searching for programs like that for a while im so on board with the idea
1057	1	i have heard of this perception
1058	1	nigerian isnt a language p the country features dozens of ethnic groups with unique languages  and names i was hoping to add to my knowledge of native names by associating these with their specific origin
1059	1	ok that is at least a little safer i still hope she destroys the pics afterwards for privacy reasons images like that can easily be misused if they land in the wrong hands
1060	1	you are rude youre not listening to anything anyone is saying all youre doing is pushing your agenda that the behavior of black men is the responsibility of black women it is offensive obnoxious and problematic af youve used up all the politeness i had to give to this nonsense
1061	1	maybe but with her status she could find love with all kinds of men i just personally think she has a habit of defending predators but maybe that is all coming from the same place
1062	1	yes
1063	1	what why
1064	1	correct especially in her video to share her side she was rude to the makeup artist then
1065	1	and it is always the girls  we all know why
1066	1	same here
1067	1	every one doesnt have the mind power like your momyes they do   words have power  we have to watch how we speak to ourselveswe need to crush all outside interactions  unrealistic impossible and harmful  we are not the only humans on this earth  the solution is to become the best we can be excel at all that we do and proudly interact with others so they know we still stand   even though they tried to break us  we can still climb to the top
1068	1	omg this is amazing there should be a group rblackladies trip to do this lol
1069	1	im in it for some reason folks want to be on the phone despite the other options i get the same things and the virtue signalling folks omg someone told me how she once hugged a black guy in public one of my clients kept boasting about how hes a good person because his wife is jamaicanchinese another person on the phone said were all white hereit also sucked when dating  men would be turned off because i didnt sound like the right type of black person
1070	1	op probably name dropped him because it is been a trending topic in this sub all year if you google it you can easily find a video
1071	1	theyre genuinely a mess i dont care if the money did come from other work he is built his career and name in the space of religion cutting your spending off somewhere below rapperfirst year nba recruit is part of the deal
1072	1	they dont here the rest of black reddit maybe
1073	1	thank you that means a bunch it is probably a lot to ask you for practice on speaking busy schedules etc but can you point me in the right direction of getting the pronunciations right i have tried duolingo rosetta stone mango languages all are great for vocab and verbs but i struggle with speaking i feel like i butcher iti try to watch french movies and listen to french music but since the actors are native it is very fast and i feel like ill never get there
1074	1	thanks
1075	1	i wouldve met him out in a field ill have some slave men with me too  we going to turn this into a fantasy alright
1076	1	we should all start a club
1077	1	something similar happened to me i had dry socket and after enduring pain for days i decided to call my dentist and try to go in for that day to have them do something about it his response was oh its normal to feel pains few days after getting a tooth pulled but i went in and he was so shocked that i had dry socket he tried to brush my pain off like it was nothing he ended up fixing the problem and my visit that day was free
1078	1	but we knew we had to educate ourselves to get anywhere god blesses hard workameni so am proud of you and all that your family has accomplished your children will implement the same strong work ethic resilience and determination you exuded on them  onto their own children this will yield such a grand chain reaction for your lineage you go girl going to already say congratulations on obtaining your masters
1079	1	what made you go for long sleeved as opposed to sleeveless id do the same lol
1080	1	no one can turn as around except ourselves   which seems to unfortunately cause the demise of many peoples future
1081	1	i agree im talking about these blanket statements that i see all the time like black women are at the bottom of the totem pole black men dont like black women and sweeping generalizations are the problem we fill our heads with all these negative stereotypes and then internalize them as factsafter taking a statistics course i am learning that there is a lot of manipulation behind statistics many of them are extremely biased you really can make a statistic say exactly what you want it to say through manipulating sample size leading questions and manipulation of the data take statistics with a grain of salt a lot of them are made by racists and people with an agenda news outlets love to report about these studies because it riles up black women who then run to social media and make it trend remember these news sources depend on advertising money that comes from clicks and attention when you actually read the studies youll find that a lot of the articles misrepresent the findings and conveniently ignore the causes in order to make a more attractive headline
1082	1	thank you and in georgia as hot as it is out there smh
1083	1	asians had the yellow peril movements i believe but for some reason they just stopped
1084	1	you are so right about that last line a lot of men dont like to be alone but want to be able to act single
1085	1	i see what is even sadder is that carimi seems to not only be composed of lighter skinned haitians but mulattoes specifically my family also haitian have always been proud of their roots in dahomey and west africa in general and embraced dark skin im sorry if it hasnt been the same experience for you
1086	1	haaavirgin islands for a conference zero work is getting doneand now im wondering if office culture in latin america honors a 2 hour siesta
1087	1	you are not lying
1088	1	well there is a gossip site called lipstick alley that is mostly black but it is super toxic
1089	1	approval ratings and favorability polls are not only extremely fickle but are far from exhaustive enough to tell us anything besides clickbait articlesin particular the bernie is the most popular politician poll that was circulated for the longest time was posted everywhere but when you actually look at the stats youd see it is only in regards to one policy question and only gave 15 choices 6 of whom werent even politicians the poll also indicated that roughly 30 of the people who took it didnt even know who some of the choices even were despite being pretty recognizable names like trump clinton pence steve bannon kushner etc
1090	1	yeah i guess so
1091	1	the dudes and suspicious accounts in here are doing it on purpose to distract two temp bans out already
1092	1	good wield the attitude like the weapon it is
1093	1	do you drink a lot of water regularly that could be why you dont experience them dehydration definitely exasperates the feeling and im pretty dehydrated right now plus going regularly like you do is probably better lately ive been going once a year or in this instance it is been two years since my last massage i need to go more often so im not all knotty and tense
1094	1	hip hop nights in fridayshonestly that whole area lower east side is a fun area to go out and bar hop
1095	1	it would be great to talk about like someone said because my experience never fucked me up
1096	1	not at any point i mean im pretty well adjusted now but i had a harder time than i had too in middle school lol
1097	1	you could use a leave in conditioner thats what i do sometimes that way i can just put my hair up in a puff and go home with my curls feeling and looking moisturized
1098	1	well im assuming were loyal because depending on where you live for a black woman dating out might bring about stress danger unfamiliarity etc that is not to say that black men who date out are met by happy white relatives and welcomed openarmed into whiteness but i know it is easier for them than it is for black women
1099	1	i honestly dont know what to say to make you see my point of view youre arguing that its problematic for dark skin women to have their own exclusive space online on a forum that is exclusively for black women like obviously you understand the purpose of needing exclusive spaces because youre hereto me you sound like white people who argue that racism is over and that if black people want to get ahead in society we need to stop acting like victims and pull ourselves up by our bootstraps in my experience theres no way of getting through to people like that so im not going to waste my energy
1100	1	i agree about the buildings i dont like when a lot of money goes toward a physical church building or unless its a much needed community center or something but what is a pastor supposed to do once a church starts growing turn people away have church outside in an open field and church staff provide real jobs for real people its trickyi have no idea what my pastors salary is but i believe he should be paid for the job he does and responsibility of his congregation that is on his shoulders and not mine preaching counseling hospital visits etc thats a lot of heavy work and i want the lights in the church to be on when i get there lol a church is an organization real talk takes money to run like one
1101	1	yeah youre right ugh i wouldnt have guessed them to be part of them though i must say
1102	1	gtyou are saying that an exclusive space for dark skinned women is good im saying i agree with you ok so whats the problem thengthowever i dont agree with the method of making it exclusive what im so confused so you agree that there should be an exclusive place for dark skinned women but you dont think that exclusive place should be exclusive in practice only in theory please clarify gt if you feel you have limited energy then quit your day job if you care about energy so much
1103	1	that is definitely true as well people even  black people themselves forget that this sub is comprised of literally 0001 of black people and that includes black women
1104	1	okay i can see that
1105	1	gtsomeone disagreeing with you isnt derailingno but implying that someone is point is invalid if they are emotional around a subject is derailing at its finest youve done a lot of that in your responses and ive chosen not to dignify it with a response ampx200bgtyou were going on a whole spiel about the pain of colorism when im already aware of itthis is due to the fact that your responses read like someone who has an intellectual understanding of colorism but no realworld experience with it ampx200bgtyour argument basically boils down tosummarythat is not what im saying i am saying that i support her in creating a space that centers the experiences of ds women i understand that some people feel that her vetting process is problematic and i can seeunderstand both sides of that argument at the end of the day i believe that she will do more good than harm and i respect the means she has deemed necessary to achieve that endampx200bgtyou mistakenly believe that this method she is using will lead to a utopia of peacei never said that and i dont see where anyone here implied anything close to that what i have done is reference the type of space i think she is trying to createoffer it goes without saying that shell have to deal with the everpresent hassles of moderating an online group but this will weed out a lot of fakers trying to get into the group and her method of vetting members will save her a lot of timeheadache in the long run ampx200bgtif you only deemed a small percentage of it worthy as a reply maybe it speaks to how you know youre not totally right and you dont want to defend your viewsno it is really about how much timeenergy i want to give to a stranger on the internet youre also mistaken in the assumption that i care about being right i mean to be fair id like to be heardhence taking the time to clarify my pointsbut it is not going to impact me if i am not and i honestly dont care if you agree or disagreeampx200bampx200b
1106	1	i agree with you about not believing in safe men and not safe men i dont blindly give trust no one should it must be earned and im suspicious of everyone until they earn itbut i also think there are a lot of abusers who fall into the category of obviously bad men who can be avoided with a bit of effort and that is mostly what im talking about people who hurt children or women usually dont start with some of the examples mentioned here it is small acts that escalatemy cousin is abuser for example if my aunt had vetted her new man properly then she wouldve known that he molested his last spouse is daughters before getting with her that is definitely an example of an obviously bad man that she couldve avoided okay so she didnt check to see if he had a criminal record not everyone does this however once she was with him his behavior with the girls shouldve clued her in
1107	1	ok but in the context of this article with a woman not trusting her husband im not seeing where that fits in it is not that she didnt vet him well enough it is that she is not going to trust any man around her daughter because of whatever she went through i feel like no mother ever wants their child to be molested when they pick the wrong men it is a horrible mistakebut it is still a mistake i just dont think saying they should have known better is productive
1108	1	that is part of what skews my opinion too i love finely crafted things so i dont put effort into faulting anyone for wanting that car or even buying it but this guy is record on multiple issues is pretty bad not just for a pastor but for a person this is probably way down the list of things he is done but it is so out there and tone deaf like you say that is a disqualifier for leaders in my book that it is an easy call for me
1109	1	im not american im from somewhere that likely didnt have any precolonial settlement and if it did  genocide was pretty complete but less so in nearby islands caribbean people know of this because it is about us and were there dominicans from dominica have kalinago people still living in and preseving their culture dominicans from dr know of their taino ancestry  most of the amerindian peoples who eventually settled in the caribbean came from south america and travelled through the orinoco river there are some ethnic groups in guyana still im so baffled by this supposed extinction
1110	1	yesbeing your own advocate means firing staff and caregivers who are subpar
1111	1	there is definitely a lot of women out there doing this ive found that a lot of communities have migrated to facebook groups these days which is annoying but ive learned to be more comfortable with just going ahead and joining them
1112	1	i am going to put it on my list of vacation destinations  i remember thinking it was just a nickelodeon thing i was this year years old before i found out there was a real place
1113	1	that is a valid answer i think valuing singlehood is in a way valuing yourself and your friendships i guess some people wrap all those things in one when diving into a relationship yes it may not be the best choice for everyone i know some women that are married and only have a high school diploma most of my classmates got married after high school and all that jazz  however i will say that i did graduate and am working towards a master is at the moment i know in the grand scheme of things it wont guide me towards a future romantic partner or whatever but it is sad for me to think in this way so hoping for change into the new year
1114	1	do you find better relationships when first meeting someone in person vs onlineedit i ask because i feel like i keep meeting fuckbois in person and online so idk anymore
1115	1	im not sure if she said that though
1116	1	ikr no other dresss lace even compared for me and thank you
1117	1	nah lol the last thing on my mind
1118	1	any tips on creating profiles ie what pics to put up or what you put on the profilealso essentially i used the sites to convert conversations to dates   could you go into more detail on how you did that
1119	1	then you can just subscribe
1120	1	damn i thought i wrote this
1121	1	no duh the federal government native organizations anthropologists and more thought we want estinct people dont know much about the tainos and are still gathering research as to how it happened people in jamaica haiti and other islands are only celebrating and acknowledging their african ancestry with no knowledge of the native people before the 1500s and this same issue is the same amongst african americans in north america and all over the world even have west and north africans who migrated to other islands and the americas before slavery or settlers by any nation the point is to get across the minds of african american descendants that we are still enslaved on our own land and the natives that are here now and in these islands are imposters and are the faces of that nation when really theyre euronative descendants not only do we have ties to africa since you are aware i hope you are telling our beloved gov this bc we are being treated as slaves who lost contact with our roots no we have lands and we want them back or a certain percentage plus more
1122	1	vaginal steaming sometimes shortened to vsteaming and also known asyoni steaming is an alternative health treatment whereby a woman squats or sits over steaming water containing herbs such as mugwort rosemary wormwood and basil wikipedia it also says it is a fad in the western world but it is been used for centuries by our ancestors it can help clear up various of viruses and cleanses the vaginal area without interrupting it is natural ph balance it helped me with my cycles as well as water one of the best treatments that we can give to ourselves in the comfort of our home you can always go to a professional if youre nervous at home but home sessions are the best in my opinion
1123	1	do you have a manager that monitors your work closely that is who id go to honestly if there no one that actually manages you id be complaining about that toobut if the raise itself hadnt even been guaranteed  i asked about your manager because i think it is worthwhile to try to advocate for yourself there first but no reasonable person would blame you for putting feelers out if this is just the latest in a string of thingsif you want someone a bit more credible than me you can try askamanagerorg
1124	1	pictures alone may not be enough for a diagnosis you can visit walkin clinics for a swab test as they are the most accurate in determining type and location if you andor your partner are planning to do blood tests make sure you both are requesting igg tests the folks over at rherpes have very good information about testing transmission and diagnosis take some deep breaths be kind to yourself and be informed i hope whatever it is heals quickly
1125	1	that last line whew i felt that one i think thats such a vital fucking question that black women should be asking themselves
1126	1	did you see him on snl in the pink pants and then later in the stripper glitter
1127	1	im sorry your family doesnt accommodate you it wouldnt be hard to roast a couple of extra sweet potatoes for you to have with earth balance and cinnamon and either some roasted brussels or a nice seasonal salad i thought it was just good manners to sure your guests can have an equal version of the main i always make a batch of kabocha and jackfruit tamales for my vegan friends
1128	1	sounds promising
1129	1	huhwhy would she give an f about this
1130	1	unlocking needing a mans approval is so key and subtle and not an obvious place to get to because sometimes the need is happening on such a level  you are so right on
1131	1	hm i may try to watch an episode ive never seen riverdale and ahs creeped me out after 3 episodes
1132	1	people who dont have real world experience think you can order women like you can chose porn obviously it is mostly dudes who think  that is how the world works you just choose your flavor harass the first one you come across and when they tell you to fuck off you feel like a victim for the next 10 years and when after those 10 years you realize youre even worse off than before blame women for having it easy and demand sexjust insecure dude logic
1133	1	well the other poster mentions it only works on attractive women so i dont know what you look like but you could be above average in looks also you said it always men from different ethnic groups does it backfire when you cry with women im asking because i dont really have knowledge on this like i mentioned i rarely cry in public at least so i dont know how this even works

1138	1	i used to go play pool and table tennis with a few people but i havent gone to those places alone those are places you kinda want to go with someone
1139	1	my point is that if men can assume that a woman wearing casual clothing is not interested in finding a relationship the same line of thinking can lead to a slippery slope where men will assume that women who are not wearing casual clothing are looking for a relationshipsexetc and there is proof of thishttpsmiccomarticles141781hereare9timesclothingwasblamedforsexualassaultratherthantheobviousq7uo1vrgp so idk why you want to act like this is farfetched  you are delusional to say this is a reach

1142	1	gtblack women age slower than most because our melanin protects us from the suns uv raysactually it depends on the shade op is if she is light skinned in the sun her skin can become dryoil and can have premature aging
1143	1	wait so if a person is a sex worker they are allowed to a shoot an unarmed person in the back of the head while they sleep that doesnt seem right i completely understand why brown felt like she needed to kill him but i dont think that justifies the actions taken given the particular circumstances ill be honest it is going to really hard to get me on onboard with agreeing it is ok to kill a person in general
1144	1	please report back i ask my mom every once in a while and she just blames my dad who deceased and cant defend himself lol
1145	1	good for you

1156	1	i think your own internalized sense of what feminine is just jumped outi also think plenty of films starring white and lightskinned women styled less feminine in your view didnt register that way for you for some reasonthat is colorism boo
1157	1	gt i agree with your general theory here that the larger a church gets the harder it is gonna be to stay accountable but what is your proposed solution for stopping large churches from becoming mega onesthe first step is honest critique of what serves god and what is serving image and ego or not all churches excuses
1158	1	were in the same boat except im on the east coast my cousins give me grief for talking like a white girl all the time  i currently work in politics and random people tell me the craziest and racist things because they think im white on the phone it is always funny watching them show up in person and are visibly startled when they find out who theyve been talking to this whole time
1159	1	im happy to hear your journey turned around like that and im lowkey jealous of your brooklyn experience haha thanks for sharing

1171	1	okay just asking because someone said we had enough supporters just curious was it in other communties or she meant black women in general i would ask her but i feel like it is a normal q to ask anyone at this point
1172	1	many women dont want to spend the 3  hours doing their natural hair so why not go with a protective style by way of wigs or weaves it takes about a maximum 20 minutes to put on a lace front wig also buying high quality hairwigs is best and if women can shell out the coin for it without having to forego a necessary expense then how is it a problem
1173	1	exactly what i was thinking she better capitalize on this if it wasnt her who put it into motion
1174	1	hmm i didnt even think about it like this since i figured shes a model and probably used to it many would consider her too curvy for editorial too sexy for printcatalogue and too dark for video girl roles i automatically thought of it from a marketing perspective of her capitalizing on being a trending topic she could easily translate this into a talk show visit the real would eat this up
1175	1	lmao yeah if we ever go private people are going to finally realize it is not white lurkers or asian trolls we just dont all agree and some of us aint shit

1181	1	are there any meetup groups in your area that interest you  ive been thinking it might be a good alternative to the standard online dating sites especially if you want to take the slow boat to relationships via friendship
1182	1	were you in north carolina before
1183	1	thanks what is the scene there like
1184	1	not to be a debbie downer but it gets worst the older you getespecially when most of your friendship circle is marriedhas kids it is hard to get my close friends to even return a damn text message these days that sheer dropoff in communicating and socializing with friends after 30 was the one thing i was completely unprepared for entering this life stage
1185	1	the student didnt do anything wrong it is a completely normal thing that can happen postmassage i normally get headaches after because i should drink more water and get more sleep plus i have lymphadema so my body holds onto a lot of sludge that people with healthy lymphatic systems dont have some people have a general feeling of malaise after it is why massage therapists recommend you drink a lot of water pre and postmassagemassage therapy releases toxins and tension from your body tissues and muscles through your blood and through the lymphatic system people get headaches or feel tired because their body is reacting to the stimulation and releasing the sludge
1186	1	considering it i never see the other black girls there with their hair wrapped so i guess i felt like there must be a reason also wasnt sure about which material dont want to sweat in my silk ones but not sure if cotton is ideal at those high temperatures
1187	1	yeah the smiling thing is also known for being quite sexist as its someone else expecting you to look prettier to them i think the show broad they explore this and use their middle fingers to smile when asked lol
1188	1	i understand both cbt and the study op used an example but my question is how much are we actually contributing to those issues not whether were dealing with cognitive distortionsgti believe that constantly exposing ourselves to negativity is what holds us back we fill our heads with everything that is wrong with usi dont believe either of these things are true not on this board and not for black people in generalgtso many times i read threads about how undesirable we are how uneducated we are how unhappy we are how we get the short end of the stick in hiring education and life and i believe that this mentality causes us to limit ourselves and not try to reach our goalsthere is a fine line between discussing how we internalize negative stereotypes and blaming us for exposure and ultimately suffering from the effects that stereotype racists love so much and i think op either stepped over it unintentionally in her post or is misinterpreting and possibly misrepresenting how and what people are complaining about on this subi think statements like those arent clear enough about staying out of blaming us primarily for our own mental states and the impact of racism on our lives mostly because i read the posts that show up here too and it is genuinely rare that you hear anyone here saying anything like black women are undesirable uneducated or unhappy what i see is people sharing the fact that theyre having challenges in dating or they personally feel undesirable or expressing challenges in education or with depression and mental health those might stem from or be exacerbated by cognitive distortions but theyre individuals sharing problems not blanket statementsi think op is being somewhat unfair in her accusations of how we process negative experiences but i also dont think black people not as a group or on this sub respond to stereotypes as if theyre trueampx200bedit take her example of black women being at the bottom of the totem pole every time ive seen that come up it is been someone dealing with pain vs making a statement
1189	1	diapers and formula are so expensive and as much as people grumble about free alternatives those have costs associated with them too
1190	1	i honestly kind of feel that this is important the fact that you actively join different subs to understand a perspective that may differ from your own is what so many people struggle with
1191	1	a pastor should not be driving a lambo if he wanted to live the lifestyle of a baller rapper or whatever then he should have chosen a different career path it is disgusting how many people do not even know what the rolemeaning of a pastor should be pastor shouldnt be driving a lambo having a private plane using church funds to buy the new xbox or creeping around fucking everyone in the church if pastor wanted to do all of that then pastor should have not be pastoreveryone stay making excuses for these charlatans and fools then wondering why noone has any faith in the church anymore these folks are con artists god is nothing but the means to their scam for them
1192	1	lol man welp hope you look into it more and fight for the cause im thinking about taking a trip to see some family in the islands of sc they are fighting for land that was given to them and now the government and realtors trying to sell it for profit it is crazy
1193	1	what is your stance
1194	1	no ive been trying since yesterday without success
1195	1	it is implausible that large droves of people migrated to the americas straight from africa the theory of the first people to live in the americas migrating across the beiring straits makes the more sense geographicallythe likelihood that people back then would cross the entire atlantic or the entire pacific sight unseen is tinyethnicities tribes only come about when a group of people live somewhere and have certain cultures diet sleeping their roles in society human dna alters to adapt and genetic markers happen the people who live closer to the equatorare more exposed to sun are naturally darker skinned for protection  so yeah there were people of colour i never disputed that but also people of colour doesnt mean dark skinnedand millions were killed colonialism usually ends in genocide and cultural erasuresome tribes are also mixed with africans because they had slaveswhat i meant by it being a thing is that to an outsider remember im not from the us im from a country that is mostly black it seems like people want to say they are 164th choctaw and so not fully black but black is just a catchall term for a bunch of different ethnicities from a huge continent as well as if youremixed with other stuff but physically present a certain way it is a social construct a typical somali person doesnt really look the same as a typical zulu but theyre both blackit is funny because in some places in the dr they say they arent afrolatino but indio when really they are buying into the antiblack sentiment that is pervasive in this postcolonial world
1196	1	im generally a killer main but when i play survivor i main claudette we should join up and become squadette hahaha i will pm you

1199	1	i think part of the solution is making the vegan lifestyle more attractive to many meat eaters which include black people are turned off by the supposed moral superiority complex of vegans you even have peta out there comparing animal slaughter to the oppression or marginalized groups its not exactly good press for veganism i for one like some vegan products but like i said before vegans should focus on encouraging people to include more vegan products in their diet rather than necessarily using them as a substitute i cant imagine a lifestyle change is easy for many even current vegans like yourself people shouldnt be made to feel ashamed or evil for not going all the way
1200	1	i would like to note that neville looks good too ill take them both lol
1201	1	sadly that doesnt mean it wont be drenched in stereotypes
1202	1	celery doesnt even taste weird it is just nothing

1204	1	thats a good idea one of my cousins did some investigating and traced one of our mothers to a plantation in georgia the family that owned her is still prosperous today multimillionaires who own a thriving golf course i do and do not want to visit that property seeing the big house alone might crack me but she and her children walked that soil maybe one dayah im sad now

1211	1	hahaha nothing i promise he got sick a few years ago and slowed down the cooking and id been doing most of it with him doing his staple sides this year he wants to see if he can still do it all without getting exhausted
1212	1	the whole show lost its meaning for me from that day onwards
1213	1	gt none of them have majority black viewershipyes they do star empire and real housewives of atlanta
1214	1	gt some people myself included just like what they like and are aware that they are more attracted to a certain group of peoplea while back i came to this realization myself  i never start or join in on those conversations that rotate around my now professed preference being better than this or that group and i dont think i harbor much resentment or animosity towards them would be potential dating partners of my own race  it is just that there are so many others running around my feet theyre generally nice to me and we have so much in common  i do tend to look at them as potentials first  first but not as a strict rule
1215	1	it confused me a bit too im not sure if it was trying to say black lives matter or believe women but it did have a fuck the police vibe to it so that is ok
1216	1	black men are doing that actually and not being commended for it bc once again media dont promote that only drama im not blaming anyone we are ying and yang what we do they do what they do we do we are reflections of one another and ill never blame women for it but i am going to say we help shape and mold men to what they become youre telling me you never seen toxic mothers who exploit their son believes they are entitled to the world and can have sex just dont bring any babies they dont need to be checked they dont need our opinions either but what we allow they do what we promote they try to be the logical conclusion is not stop dating black men where are you getting the idea from the conclusion is a lot of black women are looking for love but end up with extreme masculinity a lot of women not just black women think having children having sex allowing them to call us their bitch or extreme exploiting is enough to keep a black men you cant say dont blame us when some of us entertain guys who give us the red flag from the jump either women ignore it to save their relationship i seen that happen multiple times and these women admit and acknowledge it or they really have no clue no knowledge on how to avoid toxic masculinity cant you tell by now men will do what we allow we dont need to coddle them we dont even need to reply to them just go ghost and they will straighten up quick or try to boost white women heads and treat them like us eventually but im not blaming im a black women myself and have studied a little bit of psychology and the issues amongst black women and men you really have women who just dont know how to avoid these behaviors but then you have women who are one of us who ignore to save their marriage or relationship then you have that small group who are always retweeted or reposted that promote toxic behavior on purpose because they think it is normal cute trendy etc the list goes on this isnt just a male issue bc we are always stuck with these hooligans babies the awareness needs to be risen not feared that one is trying to blame a gender of blacks men got their own issues going on too but we wouldnt have this issue if we instantly blocked ignored etc men who have toxic behaviors especially men like the one in your sceenshot geez
1217	1	you tell chad
1218	1	my name really is aaliyah haha
1219	1	where tf are we supposed to go after tumblr officially dies tomorrow definitely see the upvote bias in certain reddits a little too easily
1220	1	super cute
1221	1	eve needs to start giving classes
1222	1	i actually saw her this yr as well but only because she was a part of a music festival and sure nuff we had nothing for the first 15 mins then her dj came on for another 15 thankfully she was amazing then she came on and performed for about 30 min of what was supposed to be s 60 min set then she got mad when they cut her mic and kept trying to sing and talk to the crowd they booed the sound guy but then she bowed and clap bitch dont try to sing one more song show your ass up earlything is based on how their contracts are written they get paid even if they perform one song so people technically got a show either way im over her and i would never pay money to see her headline
1223	1	you literally are thats her idea behind things like rape culture you dont have to commit a literal atrocity to contribute to these problems but considering one other person here had no problem victim blaming a hypothetical rape victim yeah it is a problemrape culture is trivializing the severity of the situation or reframing the discussion in a way that places responsibility and blame on the victim not the culpritwhen you create bigoted caricatures even when you try to deconstruct them that nuance is lost on a lot of people even a lot of the comedians i mentioned are aware of this dave chappelle stepped down for the longest time because he was tired of white people laughing at his material and being happy about the racism instead of the deconstructing behind it chris rock stopped doing his black people vs ns routine because he saw how many people just used it as a way to shit on black people entertainment is not divorced from the rest of our society and its a breeding ground for bigotry because it gives people an out to say its all just a jokethats when theyre genuinely trying to make some kind of point others dont do that or if they do its done disingenuously to continue being a racist shit thats what shows like family guy and south park are entirely built on its no surprise that when cleveland left for his own show in family guy they add in a new black character because the role of that character was to have a character to easily write racist jokes off ofthe number of people that treat racism like a state of being is partially because we trivialize it and treat other parts of our lives like entertainment as these separate voids where nothing affects usthe only ones arguing with emotion are these hypersensitive crybabies that are sad they cant be paid to be bigots
1224	1	thank you ill talk to her about it
1225	1	this is the best response here if youre that miserable alone it can cause you to rely too much on a romantic partner which is rarely a good thingself love comes first

1231	1	creed ii is out already
1232	1	thank you my mom grew up in a family of 9 in mississippi where her only meal was at a broken down school or stealing produce from a local garden my mom said she saw how education was her way out of povertystruggle and she would be damned if any stopped hermy mother had white professors purposelly give her poor grades explicitely tell she wasnt going to make it and white classmates who would help each other  but not her but yet she still rise she is currently a family nurse practioner in the process of obtaining her phd to move from the clinic to the classroommy dad from mississippi my grandfather only had past a 7th grade education went on to be the first black urology resident at the univ of arkansas medical school he in fact became chief resident my parents experienced discrimination the unfairness of life how their white counterparts dominated and often pushed them blacks down along the way but my parents taught me from their experience to not let that stop you yes it sucks  but it is what it is my mom would often say ok they hate you because youre black so what you going to do about it sulk how is that going to take you farshe said let that hatred fuel light your fire and you conquer the goddamn world i firmly believe black people are one of the strongest ppl based on the obstacles we have to go through
1233	1	haha i can definitely hear this comment
1234	1	i yi yi im nowhere near invested enough in your or your life to make up an alternate narrative

1239	1	gt how dare he buy a lambo isnt about envy thoughno for a split second i envied the flex i was pocketwatching deep down inside i want to drive a fun car wear the best clothes and eat in expensive restaurants
1240	1	not everyone has that same type of success story were yall homeless was raped in an abusive relationship every story is different and unique of their own i can say we have a lot of of children in the 5070s that were killed or beaten for trying to learn in 7th grade do you all not think of the many factors that people go through and that disease that sickness spreads to their young and create a generation of poverty now a solution to that is to teach each other im not going to be proud all the time when i hear another sister made in the white mans world when i think about how she has to get rid of natural appearance to make it and be successful you can tell what your generations before you did but it still shows oppression in one way or another just to work for another rich man school or hospital
1241	1	youre not wrong for wanting to show sympathy through a relatable story your edit was completely unnecessary
1242	1	youre waiting at the bus stop and a white woman decked out in uggs northface jacket and lululemon walks up and greets you what is up homiethere is nothing explicitly derogatory about what she said so why did you furrow your brows because the word itself is loaded why did she call me homie im not her homie is it because im black what the heck is her problemthe point is a simple hi would have sufficed yall dont know each other and strangers dont typically greet each other with homieit is the same thing with slurs theyre loaded you dont throw them around willy nilly and you know it is frowned on if you say them
1243	1	she has a snap too shell post videos on snap and then post the full ones on insta and youtube and tumblr twitter is the only thing that isnt that bad her videos would use that high pitched filter too ave that is the exact reason i stopped listening with sound
1244	1	she said her friend was very drunk and high so im assuming since her friend was all there she didnt feel comfortable plus i went on about it more cause of your point about not knowing a person that well i think op said date
1245	1	i really dislike statistics on these kinds of things statistics only capture broad trends but they dont get into the nitty gritty details of things they only tell you the what and then people assume the why and generalize the findings into areas that werent studied theyll assume that people have it worsebetter in all aspects of dating when that is not necessarily true for example those statistics dont say anything about things like the quality of matches people are getting and they also dont tell you how satisfied people are with their options in research like this quantity is assumed to matter most but users on those apps might not value it as much also people is offline experience might be very differentthe way i see it is that if youre satisfied with the number of options you have and the quality of the matches youre getting however you define that for yourself then you dont need to worry about what other people may or may not be experiencingi think your doctor gave you good dating tips but i know i wouldnt have been comfortable randomly being told that something is going to be harder for me because im black
1246	1	hang in there it eventually gets easier and yes take your people up on their offersthey want to help even just a hey can you hold my baby for an hour while i napshower text is a pretty low lift for all of the people who want to help but dont know how
1247	1	i dont have scare tbh its just that im little darker in the face and neck and my body a lil lighter i aint looking like a two tonned popsicle but when i have to wear foundation you notice the difference
1248	1	awww thanks for caring lol strangely enough i think it is gone i cant find it anymore on rmdememes it seems like the entire sub disappeared or something
1249	1	your response wasnt even dramatic another case of a man gaslighting black women and trying to make us seem irrational and angry
1250	1	when did you notice that you were having trouble im single 28 and want to have a child by the end of 2022 i plan on doing it alone because ive been single since 2010  i know my mom and aunt had miscarriages my mom said it took 2 years to get pregnant with me which i roll my eyes at because she was 19 when she had me but my aunt and her have 6 kids each
1251	1	the ones against her or her behavior her behavior it is obviously trash but i do wish there was a clear line between criticizing it and criticizing her
1252	1	the major topic when it comes to work issues are how to deal white coworkers and there microaggresions i think that is another part of being successful in the predominantly white corporate environment
1253	1	no im not im bringing up history the same time period and all that is rarely spoke about the numbers were for us then so are you saying black marriage was strong but the structure within the home wasnt
1254	1	i heavy sighed when i saw the post title i wish wed stop focusing on men for our sense of self worth because that is what is really driving these posts who cares about some dude you dont want anyway
1255	1	yes they are and are struggling to do it they can take that effort into building there own most ethnicity based communities dont work for white owned communities but work with them that is all im trying to say we shouldnt have the whole population depending on a source that enslaved them in the first place a lot of these nations have contracts and partnerships with them even africans but they do not have any what is so ever with the african americans here in the us doesnt that get you thinking if they are soooooo racist they wouldnt be contracting with natives small black groups africans etc im not even trying to prove a point here im just saying we need our own in order to be treated as people and not as slaves or workers we need our own to be treated equally that is the only way that is the only solution that is a natural solution that is how wars end constitutions for the blacks are born etx that is why history and law is so important and i had one user on here tell me theres more factors no sis when it all boils down to it we need our own and in order to do so is history and law
1256	1	of course it is affecting a lot of my friends and family so i thought it might be useful here
1257	1	another commenter said i was romanticizing but we had each other in the civil rights movement black panthers empowerment i believe men wanted us together to keep the family intact and not associate ourselves with more white people than needed theres so so so many stories and reasons why men felt what they did was right but in the end it is all sickness that mind mentality has spread to this generation when it isnt even needed
1258	1	whats the point in this message what are you trying to say cause if you read what i read youd know its much more than a few pathetic losers on twitter lol youre being divisive by negating and downplaying other peoples experiences this is a sub for black women if youre bothered by actual black women posting about their negative experiences oftentimes repeated experiences in real life with black men then you should leave lol
1259	1	tragictragic by noon we said fuck it and start moving name plates around
1260	1	what do you guys do and what did she smell like ive heard old people smell is a real thing and its a sign of something
1261	1	i grew out of it too she is not a princess  their kids are the spares of the spares spares of a symbolic throne    not being hypercynical doesnt equal naive it is healthy to fall somewhere in the middle especially given the causes and charities just her speaking up about in public and showing up for have already helped she already has done some good  i look forward to seeing what else she does
1262	1	what you do is flashfry your bacon with diced onion in a deep pan i use cast iron for everything until crisp and the onion is translucent and then turn off the heat  you blanche chopped and washed greens in boiling water maybe add a a splash or two of acv for a bit of acid and then in that low heat pan  use tongs to put those wilted greens in the pan with a pat of butter and some seasoning to taste   sautee on mediumlow heat until everything is looking and smelling good and serve  the whole process takes around 20 minutes
1263	1	really getting tired of the it is just a joke excuse jokes are referentialthat is what makes them funny it is never just about the direct image they elicit dg is jokes are supposed to be funny because of the gross history of moc fetishizing women of other races they consider desirable except theyre not funny they suckand literally no one gives af who he marries the only reason  i care about what he does is because he degrades black women i mean have you seen that awful clip from atlanta
1264	1	ripe or unripe
1265	1	that last part is fucking racist
1266	1	why dont you do anything
1267	1	im actually pro vouchers for this very reason i believe people should have access to good private schools and shouldnt be hindered by cost in my area the cost of sending a child to a good parochial school is equivalent to the increase in taxes id pay to move to the suburbs half what id pay to move into a really good school district three kids would be a tipping point though however why do you think black kids at predominately white schools are inherently getting a better education than black kids at black schools that is my thing most of the time the assumption that these schools are better is made simply because they are white schools and therefore must be better im not saying black kids shouldnt go to good schools im just saying that good schools is often short hand for white schools and a cover for moving to a white area white people live for this shit too so it is not about submitting to the white man
1268	1	silky weaves are less expensive to produce and are inexpensive to purchase coupled with the maintenance being much easier so that is a reason theyre more popularof course there are some women who use protective styling as an excuse but that has changed
1269	1	sounds like youve lost considerable weight by dropping the ex congratulations  and post some pics of your manicure
1270	1	yeah exactly ive heard so many excuses for not wanting to date black womanblack men why are we grouping millions of our people in the no dating category especially your own people you can be attracted to different races yes but it gets quite odd when you wouldnt want to date your own race at all and go out of your way to avoid them
1271	1	not to say everyone is stressed but other ethnicities are stressed just like us the only thing is their ethnicity white skinned is relevant for accessibility to health care services benefits and miscellaneous treatment for a better living environment meanwhile our help stops at obama care and government assistance i can say that stress isnt the only factor to poor eating habits life management skills and living wholesome a lot of us dont have that type of mindset so it is concerning of how the system has us set up for failure we allowing the system to overrun us and dictate how we should live eg eating habits school education malpractice in hospitals rude nurses or health care representatives etc due to ignorance and negligence of trying to fix the situation i barely hear women in person speak on statistics and how to improve all i hear is what a shame or just talk where is the productivity what can we do as individuals to improve how can we make a statement
1272	1	gti think they list it as an attempt to say look at me im funnyyou are so right
1273	1	it just seemed normal  my mom is an exmodel so she handled fashion for me plus i was tall and busty since i was 12 as well as super innocent it meant no makeup and pigtails for a long time  keep in mind i had to wear a uniform for 12 years i didnt really pick my own clothes until collegeit did however affect my taste in cars i had a thing for cars like a fiend  there were some retiring dads getting ferraris and there was a dealership across the street from our school  all but a couple families i knew had regular luxury cars  unless there were more than six kids usually the mom droveit really just affected where i was willing to go neighborhood wise ir what hotels i would stay in i didnt really go places other than my neighborhood or where friends and family lived my place to go on my own was the beach also the library  i also got to hang at the stables i wanted a horse so bad and some of my pals had them i really just came along to brush and feed themi demanded a horse and a mercedes and got neither i did get awesome cats and and old cadillac from my mom in high school
1274	1	coke started pushing diversity in their ads a lot too the most famous diversity ad of all time is a coke ad from the 60s or 70s id guess that cut down in the gains pepsi was making at the same time the president of pepsi left the company by the 50s and he was the one who believed in the message the people under him were worried they were going to neglect white folk
1275	1	no problem 2016 was a mess of misdirection and while that is not new for elections it is still important were all wellinformed and not double down on that misdirection so not to worry
1276	1	dont even start with that mess
1277	1	i feel like there is already got to be at least one sub for black people as a whole i havent gone looking for it because i personally care more about gender issues than race issues
1278	1	intriguing
1279	1	why do you take offense to the last paragraph what particularly are you offended by did you continue reading afterwards quote me please or reread what i have to say
1280	1	it was my 1 song i streamed on spotify lol
1281	1	in the same vein a better example would be like the priest of a church not speaking out about the sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church that is a better example and probably something that is lacking in the catholic church specifically where are the priests giving homilies on that i havent seen any give homilies or speak about how the church has not done enough to punish the perpetrators  im not catholic but that is just an example some people might have misconceptions or bad experiences with churches and trust me i have met them but what the pastor of my church has done is say look that is terrible what you went through we dont practice that here and he practices what he preaches as well unfortunately im sure there are churches that dont do that but you find out soon anyway when for example someone is being sexually harassed in church this is an example from my own life and nothing is done about it the pastor gives guidance to everyone and when someone steps out of line even him he encourages the flock to correct him he even has meetings with the congregation on how to improve the church maybe it is tiring for people nonbelievers and christians to sift through the bad churches to get to the better or even good ones but i believe as christians we should help shift people to those churches so the bad ones cant succeed im not saying that those good churches are perfect either but those churches actually hold themselves accountable and are not a rare thing since there are so many sects of christianity it is not exactly the same as a white person that was born into a privileged life for example or a cop that will simply get transferred to another state when they kill an unarmed brown person those people have the law and systemic factors that man created on their side pastors and the congregation have to be accountable to godampx200bgtthat is why i dont think the not all message is enough i dont think protecting or elevating individual churches no matter how good will ever be enough especially since all of us christians and non live the majority of our lives outside the church building and groupsampx200bi see what youre saying many christians have this go to church on sunday and sin on weekdays attitude and that is not right that is something that we can continue to preach against especially pastors if we dont already but it is not protecting or elevating churches to say that while there are churches out there involved in a mess that there are churches out there walking the walk while talking the talk since you know the bible so well you probably know that god detests that kind of behavior and it is not revolutionary in the church that he does the problem is people perhaps even john gray even though we dont know him personally or how his church runs are ignoring it or dont understand it however there are christians that do ideally less than 100 will never be enough for god or for the state of the church but the aim is to get as many people as possible to heaven whether that includes everyone on earth is something only the lord knows no one said elevating or protecting individual churches would be enough elevating or even protecting churches doesnt mean youre not part of the people striving for change it could also mean you want it to be known that you are striving for change it is not defensiveness to want outsiders to know that  it is just like when a white person says all black people sit in failure and dont do anything to change the nature of the black community is plight while ignoring people like lebron james or even organizations that address intercommunity relations and violence and give back to black communities also many christians and outsiders do spend the majority of their lives outside of church but1 we were not only talking about what happens in the church as in actual churches but what happens outside of church i doubt gray bought his wife a lamborghini in a church and what he does outside of his church will affect what he does in his church and vice versa2 the church is a major source of fellowship for christians especially for people like me that dont have many friends the church fellowship doesnt just end on sunday it extends throughout the week any church where people dont communicate frequently with each other is a recipe for disaster3 church isnt just about being in a physical building it is about your relationship with god god is always there addressing the state of the church also addresses what people think of christians as well since people associate christians with church they dont associate them with rap metal army uniforms etc furthermore there are many churchrelated organizations like the ymca and the salvation army that do a lot for the community and the world heck the civil rights movement was led by church ministers like martin luther king church is a major part of a christian is life it doesnt just end on sunday churches have even affected the lives of people like us they give kids and adults a place to sleep eat and talk whether you are christian or not christian they give us a source of communion and home i suggest you read this article about the meaning of church httpswwwgotquestionsorgwhatisthechurchhtmlhttpswwwgotquestionsorgwhatisthechurchhtml be careful not to minimize the meaning of churchampx200bgtthis is probably where we differ again because i dont see the church or churches and christianity as the same thing just things that overlap  gt  gtbut i know there are good christians out there theyre some of my closest friends and family but like i said i dont believe in not all ing anything not even groups im a member ofampx200blike i stated previously you should read this article httpswwwgotquestionsorgwhatisthechurchhtmlhttpswwwgotquestionsorgwhatisthechurchhtml the church is more than just a physical building in matthew 1820 jesus even says this quotegtfor where two or three gather in my name there am i with themchristianity isnt just about your own personal beliefs or actions it is about communion and love with one another those things are the basic tenets of what a church isampx200bgtagreed i also think there is more behind those statements than the surface but that is a completely separate conversationampx200bnot completely it is related because these pastors are the faces of christianity as a whole and people even christians tend to think that what a pastor does defines christianity as a whole you obviously dont think that due to your comments on this thread and neither do i sorry for my long comments
1282	1	ehi can get why that would happen has happened to me numerous times but being annoyed by that is still incredibly valid especially if people often associate negative stereotypes with the majority black city which is inevitable the fact that she dodged the question is annoying too but i digressit sounds like she is somewhat trying but may not be adequately equipped to handle situations with different ethnic groups i could be totally wrong since i dont know her though t ibu do notice interactions like these happen a good bit with any figure that is in a helping positioni suppose being hella blunt about this to her how this makes you feel could help but it could also be awkward and id hate for you to deal with that  your therapist should be easy to talk to aside from what you told me has she been helpful i wouldnt know anything about a black therapist seeing as mine is white but i got lucky with this cool woman that shares me interests and dark humor so there is hope to be had if you end up looking for another later onno need to hater yourself sis your feelings are 100 valid being a black woman is not easy but youre out here talking about your feelings and trying to make sense of it all you deserve a space that is comfortable and i truly hope you get what you need either your therapist or a different one if needed
1283	1	i dont mind british stuff that is diverse but i fucking hate period dramas it is just an excuse for white people to only cast white people theyre the only ones that reminisce about other time periods
1284	1	girl he told me interracial porn was all he was into now amp would send me the links like thinking about you ok sir what do you want me to do with this information
1285	1	lolol
1286	1	youve been a total inspiration im working at it slowly but surely i went to ulta today and invested in primer and a sponge my skin isnt nearly as gorgeous as yours but one day i hope to be as flawless
1287	1	lol thanks
1288	1	thank you
1289	1	here is something that uanotherforest said abovegt it is disgusting how many people do not even know what the rolemeaning of a pastor should be1httpswwwredditcomrblackladiescommentsa71ct2megachurch_pastor_john_gray_defends_200kec0c6dxwhen i was younger i put the priest on a pedestal he was more than human he was morally superior and because of that he was the one best suited to give us spiritual guidance at least that was my 10 year old thinking once i heard about the sexual scandals that idea quickly crumbled same with the pastors whose churches needed to be spruced up but theyre driving mercedes benzyour explanation reinforces that pastors are people churches have to make budget as i was telling urhombus2 how gray lawfully spends his money is up to him but using the bible to deflect scrutiny rubs me the wrong way it reminds me of politicians who wrap themselves in the flag and cupcheck people is patriotism upvoted and respect to your father for publicly denouncing the foolishness
1290	1	great advice
1291	1	wow i had no idea thanks i agree with you
1292	1	a whole crate full
1293	1	agreed im tired of theses posts honestly its the same complaint over and over i dont know what to tell people except dont pay attention to the black guys who dont like black women dont hate on other poc women because some black men are into them if you have a good black man good for you if you dont there are plenty of fish in the sea maybe youre meant to be with one maybe you arent its not the end of the world if you dont end up with a black man its really not its way more important to end up with someone who loves and respects the hell out of you but to make blanket statements about the state of the relationship between black men and black women isnt helping us its hurting us it breeds resentment anger  entitlement disappointment tension and so much more there are always going to be black men who shit on black women  thats a fact but that doesnt mean all black men feel that way why are we sitting around waiting for them to validate us i really dont understand this
1294	1	yeah but the shit stirers probably arent the accounts youre thinking they are the mod team sees a lot of bad behavior from regulars that most users wouldnt notice  the lurkers and trolls arent creating drama here shit stirers from other black subs or who run to them are there are people in this thread i wouldnt add as an approve submitter
1295	1	it makes sense that theres more diversity too because african or indian culture will be much more interesting to the art crowd than a bunch of doctors in white coats who use a one size fits all approach with patients
1296	1	ugh the catcalling the worst part is these men know that the girls they prey on are underage but use things like breasts to appear oblivious ive read so many reddit comments where men excuse notorious pedophiles just because their victims have a superficial physical characteristic of a woman practically every reddit rape apologist ever bububut it is not pedophilia it is ephebophiliaedit grammar
1297	1	i mean its fetishization not in a way asian or lantina women would experience i think its just that people have this idea of how light skinned women are in their minds black in attitude and curves but light in skin and haireyes and thats what attracts the fetishists
1298	1	speak on it
1299	1	thanks for the info
1300	1	yeah i def see how he could be read as hispanic or mixed on the one hand it is nice seeing south asian representation mira the royal detectivehttpewcomtv20181129disneyjuniormiraroyaldetectiveallindiancastamp is making headlines because south asian representation has historically been lacking in disney cartoons but on the other hand the movie doesnt really give us that  the prince is ambiguously brown and ethnic and that lack of specificity feels like a copout and it can give the impression that disney thought that two black leads would be too much for one movie
1301	1	we need to make a forumor discord
1302	1	ok i understand all that youre saying especially about me being vulnerable and this not being a positive distraction i think i was most intrigued by this idea because it would be something new and exciting to break up the monotony of my grad school relationships i have tried talking to older guys as well and found a lot of fake woke dudes who do the same shit as guys my age but are just way better at making their bullshit i thought this could be a situation be very different based on some of the stories i have heard but youve put it more in perspective of what the reality of my situation looks like and i appreciate that seriously thank you for your response
1303	1	and a sweetheart too
1304	1	what kind of projects i used to use a cricut i dabble in several crafts scrapbooking painting sewing drawing
1305	1	thank you so much
1306	1	wow thanks quick question how do i get my horse out of the camp it wont let me mount it
1307	1	gtwearing an afrothat was more so towards a style which is definitely understandablethis is speaking in terms of a movie a movie that was meant to entertain everyone made by white people we cant claim anything that pertains to a movie
1308	1	yeah seriously fuck the comments
1309	1	find out how many widgets you produced for the company or saved for the company try to identify which metrics your employer prioritizes if you cant get specifics use general business formulas eg costs of goods sold or anything youd find on an income statement and get analagous data for the business location dontlet not having the specifics stop you make educated guesses for your industry and location let ir be known youre making estimates and what they are based upon let is say you are a corporate property manager every vacant square foot in your building costs your company you manage a 10000 sqft building at the beginning of the year there was an 8000 sqft vacancy as of december 1 there was a 2000 sqft vacancy because of your efforts the company isnt out of the woods but you improved their situation threefold  put 75 occupation increase let is assume 100sqft per month is what you charge 6000  100  60000 revenue per month is what you earned for the company  if you make 50000 annually you paid your entire salary and some of your benefits in what seemed to be a down market or for a poorly marketed facility tell them the percentage increase as well as the dollar amountmaybe you did even more your company charges 100sqft to tennants because it is inclusive ofall utilities and network for internet access  the company pays out 80sqft per month because of this bundle there are competing utilities and you found that contracts were expiring and got bids from all utilities and telecoms  you review and negotiate such that the company only has to pay 60sqft for all those services you have saved the company 20sqft  10000 sqft  200000 per month report this dollar amount the percentage saved and mention that you may have saved some ftes full time employees jobs  you significantly lowered the cost of goods sold it is quite likely you did because that building was paying out hundreds of thousands of dollars per month for a building vastly under capacityalso keep your eyes peeled for other buildings your company owns find out if the company was interested in selling any buildings you may say youd be an asset in making these buildings appealing to investors via your transitional skill set there is an old cuba gooding jr movie during which he exclaimed show me the money show your boss  and any prospective ones the money  if you can make projections about future revenue generation or costsavings you can pull off do it youre proving youre worth investing indoes this help
1310	1	simple and straight to the point  thank you that makes perfect sense
1311	1	what a sad soul that person is
1312	1	i thought something was off
1313	1	i know youre the op   i also use the abbreviation for original post and was drawing a comparison between your posts i think youre headed in the right direction based on your predicament it comes down to trust and what youre comfortable with as a multidimensional patient whose needs come first  to me therapy is one of those areas where you can be as biased as you want and there is nothing wrong with that because it is an area where the highest moral good is your self care   trust is earned and if she is on that path as a person and you personally find comfort with the antioppressiveness she is demonstrated that means something and just as you dont owe poc anything you arent obligated to have a black therapist just because  especially if your queerness is just as if not more important in terms of your therapy experience also while racism and antiblackness are global they function differently outside the us  i feel like there is more breathing room in certain places for some to not be as indoctrinated by the mainstream and their ingroup  you would have a better sense of how it plays out there i feel you on it being hard i think youre handling it very well considering  being introspective and turning the mirror on ourselves and our judgements is its own tightrope you got this and i hope you have you continue to have a good therapy experience
1314	1	i see what you mean i guess at the end of the day it also depends on how one defines blackness as well
1315	1	i used to be like that about my face too turns out a lot of skin problems i had were because of my harsh routine had to remove some steps and products and go barefaced to recover lola lot of natural ingredients can also irritate your skin and make things worse and the thing about a drop of product is disappointing as well that is one of the reasons i prefer to whip up my own batch if it is simple to make
1316	1	gtto me stating im black is asserting my place as a black person including africa and the entire diasporayes this makes total sense so your black is synonymous with african and african people and jamaican is your culture yes
1317	1	what is your size
1318	1	i see myself as a black african woman it is rather exhausting for them i am sure however i do welcome the other descriptors because it doesnt always have to be about race
1319	1	that is me when i forced to come in to work on my work days
1320	1	the zimbabwe i grew up in was pretty amazing its such a pity that it has gone so downhill because it had so much to offer botswana is supposed to be really good but its expensive
1321	1	can relate so hard to this
1322	1	and how many of thosr people would go to britain without them i doubt there would be that much of a difference

1327	1	you dont get why your manager allowed him to steal a black womans work and take full credit umm because they are known for stealing ideas that they had no part of it sounds to me like this potential raise is hush money theyre paying you to say that timmy from cubicle 3 did it instead of you to me your program sounds amazing and it sounds like something this company can really benefit from personally i would hope that youd respect yourself and your hard work enough to stand up for whats right but at the end of the day its going to come down to whether or not youre ok with them literally stealing your work this is some damn modern day workplace slavery they take your shit and give you a little extra slop under the table fuck that stand up for your shit it can be done in a tactful way

1330	1	gt visitbritain reckons that tourism linked to royal residences such as buckingham palace and windsor castle adds up to 27 million visitors a yearthat is just an assumption that people only go there because of the royals the palace of versailles gets about 10 million a year so clearly you dont need royals to get people to look at a building
1331	1	you havent seen kpop idols have you some of the bts members are out of this world handsome
1332	1	youre definitely reaching and its weird that you dont seem understand that ways people dress does affect perception if im at the bar and a dude is wearing gym clothes im just going to assume hes not interested in getting into a relationship at the moment
1333	1	gt i disagree with posting the gift online but i suspect it is one of those i messed up big time gifts you know those gifts where the larger the fck up the bigger the price tagi think this too and i think it ties in to that whole thing with talking about his wife being a coat or whatever
1334	1	gtcomedians are moreless expected to dig into the common taboos for humor is sake i wouldnt expect the same from singers but they sure can if they so desireagreed but the things anyone who is antipc is complaining about are more than welcome in spaces where people with the most power in society live they arent even close to universal taboos i bet any of them can find plenty of churches board rooms bars and even houses where they can be as nonpc as they want without kickback there are so many other taboos out there they can be addressing i think theyre just complaining about an erosion of power
1335	1	gti dont believe in looking to white women for guidance or standards in anything but we support black men in many more ways than they do so a few who happen to take in men to feminist groups dont mean much to mei dont believe in it either i just viewed for perspective and what makes them different through the internet i see a lot of support but in real life i can say it barely exist in my world and i travel gtthat is their problem and they probably need to do some self reflection before deciding they dont have issues with hypermasculinity im sure they dont give white people that pass when it comes to racism question how do you know these men have issues with hypermasculinity the men in these groups are down to earth thoughgtfeminism isnt a trend with black women it never has been anyone who says or thinks it is needs to read up on our history more outside of the perspective of white peoplewhat i meant by trend is people ignorantly claiming they support or with the black feminist movement but use the term for their own propaganda in a way it can be used in means to destruct and disrupt a race if you have a few people who can market their page correctly gtagain this is their choice they can and should work on that it is not a choice if they are not aware especially young men i know for sure they dont even know groups like this exist the topic on black men is typically negative or can be too romanticsexualizing them as this goes for black women as well we have a diverse topic to stay away from that and progress that men do not have that luxury especially those who are speaking for men in general which are predominantly women of all races which is a spam for those black man who wants to speak up and correct the wrong their voices are pushed down we always stay tending and we are finally freakin progressing i see that but i still see our men that are worthy stuck at the bottom and grouped with a bunch of hypermasculine men to put it precisely gtare these adult men theyre able to run businesses start and run churches put together sports teams and parties they can do this on their own if theyre interested just like weve started our own groups and worked through our own issues if they cant there wasnt any hope in the first place that is the thing they are doing that but it is not receiving any recognition it is not that many of them but it is more of us hell we have white women and other oppressed groups of women trying to link with us more than anything if you have millions of women of ethnicities somewhat working together what happens to black men bc as far as i know these people are strict on allowing non blacks from disrupting their passion and progression and for the little groups of men who dont care about race whitelatinaindians are not helping them or want to help them even in a fake way theres even studies about certain fields being dominated by women so to say that they are able to run their businesses isnt incorrect but their voices are pushed down by every single race and gender we started our own groups and it is being shared by millions of all races black men not so much even if we are helping them theyre not being highlighted of our progress it skips in the trending areas of social media and society
1336	1	we cant relate without backlash because hapas also openly brigades and harasses users over here
1337	1	that has to be a horrible feeling why are people like this
1338	1	this is one of my biggest beefs lol with white vegans like i get it you dont support animals dying but like theyre animals dont fucking compare black people to animals what the fuck you can get your point across differently smh
1339	1	that says a lot considering my school in one of the most backward states in america made mention to it
1340	1	ah ok
1341	1	racist people often think black people succeed due to some sort of charity or being exceptional for their race you can see white people saying that about pretty much every single black person since the current racial definition existed also affirmative action doesnt even apply to college admissions so this is another example of the actual law being irrelevant to black people is accomplishments
1342	1	respect so i guess the bigger question is is the problem the reason behind the wait or the wait itselfthink about it some women are waiting for a miracle their man to change drastically maybe the guy isnt marriage material in terms of what your standards are for a husbandwhile others may be in a mutual waiting period with their partner for example the couple are on the same page about marriage their relationship commitment etc but are also mutually waiting for such things as getting their money up career milestones the luxury of living and traveling before kids entering the picture etc
1343	1	i swear everyone gets some kind of awakening at college i go to a  pwi and that is where i learned to appreciate my blackness also
1344	1	gt  lol yet people support those very rappers and sports stars and dont hold them to higher standards since theyre public figures  it is sad and telling that you compare your religious leaders to worldly entertainers who havent made any vocational commitments to god gtit doesnt matter if those poor people made a vow to god to leadif you actually believe this as a christian we dont have much more to talk about all ill do is ask that you read james 3 specifically verse 3 though the whole passage is good gthe only talked about greed however having valuable possessions does not equal greed that is my point youre not the only one capable of buying things that you can afford or saving money pastors can do the same thingjesus made clear examples in his life and his teaching around the importance of walking away from wealth that doesnt equal a vow of poverty but you can only make the defenses youre making if you ignore huge parts of who he was and what he taught please look up his teachings on riches and especially mark 10 gti agree that this is wrong but youre being hyper judgmental of all pastors that have material posessions and that is what i dont like you should also ask yourself why you dont like this and why youre so defensive since theyre supposed to be held to higher standard have a nice day
1345	1	i couldnt cut it with sew ins so when i do go to a hair shop i walk out with a wig
1346	1	i would have to say the most difficult part of being a black male leader in the community is how do you assume authority   as a black man being educated or even wealthy doesnt guarantee  any position of leadership in the black community  in fact sometimes it does the opposite    a lot of the leaders in black communities are clergy  the richest black man in this country isnt jayz or anybody famous  it is just a guy who majored in chemical engineering  he does philanthropy and he does hold a position of power but a lot people in the black community havent heard of him so he isnt influential in that regard  i think the most influential people black male wise are reverends politicians entertainers or journalists i have nothing against people like tnashe coates but he doesnt have the ability to build or financial where with all to move black men forward   if you look at the numbers statistically and added it all up the people who have the most wealth are the builders  theyre almost always engineers telecommunication infrastructure oil and gas and mining they arent the sexy jobs and they arent flashy entertainers  in order for the race to progress there needs to be a revolution of thought on who is qualified to lead and who has the ability
1347	1	r drama is still mad ides left them
1348	1	doesnt matter really im just curious on what other people on this sub listen to rather than suggestions even though theyre welcome
1349	1	thanks and no problem you dont need anyone is permission and yes some times you just have to make up your mind that you are going to do it and move forward with it
1350	1	yes i definitely believe chappelle understands why his previous comments were inappropriate and hurtful and i dont think hell be repeating his mistakes again he is a dude that will take pictures with his fans on the street he seems pretty humble about himself and i dont think he believes he is above making mistakes and learning from them   kevin hart however he is just mad he got caught his comments are maybe three years old  and he hasnt changed he is not trying to step back and figure out what he did wrong and how to move forward from it he is been problematic for ages and hollywood should have vetted him better before they allowed him to become a huge household name he certainly doesnt deserve hosting the oscars and they should give the gig to someone else who doesnt harass minorities for a living
1351	1	yes so over rated tbh im not really a fan of pets in generalmakes for awkward conversations
1352	1	yes accountability is so important
1353	1	it seems like they were able to identify the couple their names are saint suttle and gertie brown and they were both ragtime performers you can see them on the cover of this offensively titled sheet music released in the same yearhttpslibrarydukeedudigitalcollectionshasm_b0419 im not sure if they were an irl couple though here is another rag saint suttle wrote in 1899httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxvlwim8ld8i
1354	1	ive put mine off for 4 days and have visitors coming so it has to happen today ive already taken my hair down but have no idea how im going to find the motivation to get in the shower
1355	1	yess cuz i swear not every white guy is going out if their way to say something racist and disrespectful half of the time when i see one of those posts i sit back and think where the fuck are yall meeting these guys
1356	1	gt yeah youre reaching going yeah im tired of hearing about this has absolutely nothing to do with moralslmao youre doing more than that youre telling women what they can and cant say and imply that it is not valid to feel a certain way when you shut down their feelings and concerns gtit doesnt most black women when dealing with racist nb males dont think it is something wrong with them hence them not trying to figure out what makes racist nb males tickyou cant speak for all black women as a minority and a black woman you should know that racism rears its head in many different ways black women will not be aware of all these ways gtyou dont need warning flags for racist black males because unlike nb males they will scream to the mountain tops they dont like usthere are nb males that will do the same thing too but that is not representative of all black males why do you think a racist white woman marrying a black male is any different from a racist black male dating a black womangtdo you not see the bs in that and how that plays back into my point of they dont care why should weand thats a problem on their part there are plenty of problems that would never be solved if we just said they dont care so why should we maybe we should be telling them why they should care and why they shouldnt abdicate responsibility gtdo we go into white asian latino etc spaces and discuss why theyre racist lmao no we dont because we arent trying to give them a pass like what is being done herewhere has anyone given them a pass has anyone said it is okay for them to be racist no and why would we go into a latino asian etc space and discuss why theyre racist this is an issue that affects bw so it will be discussed in a bw sub first and foremost gtas i said several threads have been made here about racist nb males and it is not met with this same level of understanding and supportgive me examples because i havet even seen threads about racist nb males lately
1357	1	bruh youre big mad looolll have some caprisun and take a seat chill out a little and do something productive id reccomend you try cross stitching maybe then you wont feel the need to harass a stranger over the internet because of two sentences
1358	1	i feel the last part about just wanting to hook up and nothing more  ive done interracial dating for the most part and its hard for the reasons you said
1359	1	gt well clearly youve clearly made up your mind about what you want to believe and think your way is the superior waypots kettles
1360	1	not even close for one he did a shit job at campaigning and in particular has been criticized for his outreach toward black voters he lost in no small part by millions because of voters of color which is what led to a lot of progressive racism against black people when we were deemed low informationbernie has continually said a bunch of blatantly racist shit over and over again and has shown zero signs of changing or improving from what cost him the election the dnc and the democratic party in general had none of the things that ruined bernie and none of the bullshit they talk about holds up when you actually look into it particlary the emails that came up one look at the timestamps on them show that it is impossible for them to have influenced the primaries in any meaningful way from the time of the email to the end of the primaries since hillary had been far ahead of him by thenbernie lost because he was mediocre and even now still has no concrete idea of what the hell he is doing i dont believe hillary was perfect but she only looks moderate because she is the only one between herself sandersand trump who actually had a tangible plan of implementing what she was talking aboutsanders has also taken numerous shots at obama disrespected dr king continually stands up for bigots and defends blatant racism and constantly whitewashes civil rights issues as just class issues there is also all the misdirection against hillary during the election that as noted before doesnt hold up at all when you spend time looking at where it comes frompretty much anything about dnc rigging is bullshit propagated by russian right wingers and sanders played right into their hands
1361	1	i agree its crazy
1362	1	you ladies are making me interested in astrology what is significant about a saturn return off to google

1364	1	the gary halbert newsletterrest his soul he is good at what he does and that is direct response copywritingif his writing style is your bag you will get a lot out of him there is so much to glean but he has a massive ego you either love him or hate himthe multilevel marketing rant is one of my favoriteshttpswwwthegaryhalbertlettercomnewsletterszdla_multi_level_marketinghtm
1365	1	hugs
1366	1	agreed there are some babies who are allergic to typical baby milk formulas and their milk can be like 30 dollars a can ive seen families who have both parents working fulltime still qualify for wic
1367	1	thank you im checking for it now
1368	1	idk everyone knows it is just about the worst thing you can do an abuser isnt going to shout his abuse from the rooftops he is going to hide it as well humanly possible there is also the part where abusive people in general are often excellent at faking that is why being wary of everyone is so important
1369	1	she posted a selfie with this guy which clearly indicated they were an item but no other info on him no name or name so her fans barbz went hard on their investigation and started saying that it is some guy who had rape charges some people were saying that it was a different dude but this comment confirms it is him and she doesnt think his charges are a big deal overall everyone barbz or not agrees this guy is a scrub lol
1370	1	you actually did the right thing putting his name because he has been problematic for a while except he understands that he needs black women on his side so that is why he has tried to clean up his act in order to keep his black female fanbase it is disappointing to see some of the responses but not that surprising either the constant need to protect black men from relevant genuine and salient criticisms is really getting ridiculous i love black men i will go to the ends of the earth for mine and i live my truth  99 of my romantic partners have been black men but the original twitter account made very relevant points and she wasnt wrong the triggered responses prove it
1371	1	right now ive been writing about travel with some beauty topics here and there im still trying to figure out my thing i just know i like to travel and talking about navigating my 20s as a black woman whatever that is itsawrapxxushttpwwwitsawrapxxusm1 is the blog im always in a head wrap and its the blog of my twenties so the roman numeral xx lol
1372	1	she and amy schumer make me so irrationally angry
1373	1	right so i understand why it can become inconvenient to not be married but i do think that is also capitalism strong arming people into marriage and doesnt necessarily speak to why some people prioritize it with regard to values the woman i referenced in the article literally said she didnt actually care about the legal papers but she would leave a man if he didnt want to have a wedding that is suspect  to me i hope as a society we can untangle our financial and other social systems from marriage  im currently able to be on my boyfriend is health insurance as well as a beneficiary for his life insurance but we live in a relatively progressive state i understand how in the us having kids changes things with regard to marriage but i also know plenty of  people that make it work with nothing but trust different strokes for different folks
1374	1	wait what
1375	1	my buddy started as a cna she now has her np in cardiac
1376	1	the inability to relate is frustrating but the worst to me is the entitlement to police conversations they neither have the range for nor belong in apart from a listening role at most stay in your lane please
1377	1	thanks for ur reply i agree with everything you saidit is a hard life out here but you know what we will push through
1378	1	if you look at many white posts on reddit they clearly sound like theyve never even been around a minority if a white person is seeing posts like yours the chance that they might actually learn something and change their mode of thinking albeit small matters to black folks
1379	1	well yes and noshe assumed i was from a rougher part of towna majority black city even though i told her during our first session about the city i was from predominantly white i dont hold it against her because a a lot of people form my school are from that city and and b i might have assumed she was from a majority asian citybut still its a bit unnerving because its kind of a stereotype and when i asked her why she thought i was from that city she completely dodged the question which didnt helpshe also pokes fun at her asianness sometimes which kinda makes me uncomfortablei try to remember that shes not perfect and that she does recognize my challenges as a african american womanshe has given me resources at times to make me feel less alienated when i told her that i felt isolated bc the people in my major were mostly white she gave me information about a black youth group and she also gave me info to see a hospital that catered to women of color because she didnt want a white doctor making me feel like shit a small part of me feels she is being performative and i wonder if she would defend the korean beauty supply stores and if shes happy that theyre thriving over black beauty supply stores i want to trust her and it feels awful that i dont and i could never ask her id come off as crazy i mean i am but she doesnt have to know to what extenti could go to a black therapist but id probably find something in her to be suspicious of as welli hate that im like this
1380	1	thank you so much and im definitely getting those vibes from both the schools howard definitely seems to be the stronger fit for me right now just because of the broader range of people and experiences part of me feels like spelman is slightly elitist in a way
1381	1	there are roughly 215 million black men in the united states im assuming thats where your from  so you know roughly 1015 shitty ones  come on now  if you want to date other races thats your prerogative but your not going to drag 215 million people under the bus because of a few of their actions if thats how you operate i really hope you dont date white men lmao
1382	1	thank you we have to vet who we let into our lives no more no less
1383	1	face is 1 to me and i think she is got a beautiful face
1384	1	thank you so much this is such an amazing and supportive group have a great day and new years
1385	1	that is some serious truth girl its so frustrating
1386	1	thank you i appreciate it
1387	1	yeah i am so confused we need the tea lol
1388	1	thank you i live in a city known for its passive aggressiveness ive found the way to deal with a lot of folks here is to confront them in the most ridiculous ways possible works like a charm every time
1389	1	httpswwwredditcomwikicommentingwiki_postinghttpswwwredditcomwikicommentingwiki_posting    gtspoilerltgtspoilerltif you use new reddit there is an icon under the text editor that looks like an exclamation mark in a circle that marks selected text as a spoiler
1390	1	mmhmm
1391	1	please do anytime
1392	1	it is also internalized antiblackness they stay because theyve accepted the lie that black spaces and faces hate them
1393	1	thanks i read both threads and the comments for the most part dont seem racist it just feels like they are using the main thread as a template to show the similarities in dating and the way races are seen by othersmaybe im missing something here but i never use that subreddit so i dont know if there is a racist culture there or whatnot ill snoop around some more to get the feel of that sub
1394	1	thankyousis
1395	1	there is an onscreen death but it is not gorey one of the bad guys uses a gun when i went there were 2 children around 5 in the row in front of me and they seemed very happy at the end of the movie when i noticed them personally i would not take my 8 year old because he is very sensitive to uncomfortable situations on screen ralph breaks the internet was too much for him it depends on how your child handles tension and the idea of death overall it is an exciting movie with nothing really noticeably inappropriate just lots of cartoon action
1396	1	my hair looks real similar to this any suggestion on how to define the curls i have some super define corkscrew curls throughout but the rest is frizz ive tried gel and that turns into a big sticky mess that shrinks down when i sleep ive got two inches of hair now but its only looks like 25 inch most days
1397	1	your user name does not check out youre much more of a bestmodonreddit
1398	1	thats just it youre not this site is limitless in its ability to provide you with posts that will make you say what the fuck out loud
1399	1	the fact that they wouldnt even be there if she had paler skin kind of disproves their point
1400	1	hmm i dont see it she doesnt have a huge filmography i feel like she was feminine in what was out there
1401	1	i made the reading list the first week he started i do believe in supporting coworkers just not lazy ones i stopped the moment i realized what he is up to
1402	1	im from the south and being into a lot of things especially reading was encouraged by a lot of black people likea lot even the kids they might not be bookish themselves but are always curious as to what you are reading
1403	1	we are wearing fake nails weaves lace fronts fake eyelashes and even fake butts  weve got to learn to love ourselves
1404	1	maybe well meet at a bar
1405	1	gti couldnt even go on rafrica of all places without seeing ignorant commentsnot the comments but i often see that there is some person who likes to post threads that either center white people or lowkey try to say look how shitty africa isampx200b
1406	1	i think mickey and minnie but thats so overdone so im not sure the space im renting is rock n roll themed but i couldnt find any cute two themed things lol
1407	1	i mean that does seem like it could be going into ideas about good hair and all the thorny racial issues that go along with it hopefully it is not that i understand your discomfort i would be uncomfortable too
1408	1	i felt this i just dont understand growing older does not mean we have to sacrifice enjoying life tbh if mine had kids i wouldnt even mind them bringing the kids sometimes just stop making excuses theres so much to do but people would rather sit inside majority of the time the only way i could get my friends to go out at one point was if it was to a restaurant i literally had to tell them that they have to eat to survive anyway lets just eat together it shouldnt be this hard to do basic shit its just time for new friends i guess you need different friends for different things huh
1409	1	we need a study to have actual proof that it happens since racists and ignorant people love to act like racism doesnt exist
1410	1	itd be funny if garnet fused with pearl and then she immediately just called the police on everything instead of actually fighting
1411	1	i wouldnt recommend giving up your religion to meet a man it sounds like she is looking for a man with similar values so i dont think she is interested in men that are cowering at the thought of a religious women ive also never met a black man in la that was checking for a basic size 2 of any race so im not sure that has much to do with it either
1412	1	at first yeah and sometimes every now and then for example turning off all media consumption that isnt problack that wasnt a standard i could hold myself to at least when it came to things beyond music so now i make it a point to in addition to other things consume afrocentric media that is easier now and days luke cage and black panther were greati feel like when it comes to forcing things that a little push goes a long way but too much pushing leads to resistance i still havent watched get out but im not beating myself up over itthe hardest part is to just notice my own thoughts and be able to look at them without judgement meditation helps i ask myself who taught me to think this way who told me slavery was over because that is a lie who told me white beauty standards are the ultimate form of beauty because that is a lie who told me cops are here to protect us liars theyre the sort of things ive had to put thought into and process it gets easier over time
1413	1	how did you guys watch it
1414	1	of course it is i dont know why anyone post these things to either black sub they are designed to get black people to reaction and post to the sub to get us upsetthere should be a rule on both subs about posting low hanging fruit from shit subs
1415	1	damn its like that in the  gay community too
1416	1	gtstfu you bad built dusty bitch  gt  gthe doesnt have the sense god gave a wombat trying to tell women want to do  gt  gtmay he never get pussy in 2019those women are ruthless
1417	1	thats so infuriating and the fact that this impression of sojourn truth has carried on through the ages
1418	1	this is america
1419	1	exactly my problem right there
1420	1	dark skin is beautiful  you have to see yourself as beautiful for it to attract others
1421	1	gt  that wont happen thoughim sure folks were saying that abolition wouldnt happen or independencewe have to fight for it yes but it can happen
1422	1	well obviously theyre trying to stigmatize guys who do treat their gf is like humanbeings it is really common among men and comparable to negging but instead you try to make people question their sexuality and when they do you belittle them for it they also feel like theyre the real men of society and deserve sex from any woman they desirewhen they cant get it they blame all women and the men these women do sleep with i sometimes think that part of the reason why some dudes get so toxic about sex is because there hormones are out of whack because they dont have enough exercise in life  and not saying anything down the lines of exercising to replace actual sex or anything i just think that maybe it can make a difference when it comes to aggressivenessfrustration can totally happen to women too obviously and maybe it happens to dudes who dont get laid often more because they have even less exercise you know no sex no burning caloriesive always felt that  watching your health ever so slightly makes a big difference in how positive you feel about your own sexuality or how you experience it and i think there is a lot of people who just neglect exercise decent food quality relaxationsleep because they used to feel fine back when they were youngi dont know who knows definitely not apologizing anyone is bad behavior feeling like shit happens to all of us but you have to actually choose not to act like an ass over it
1423	1	i used to love those i should have bought a ps4 on cyber monday now theyre back up in price whomps
1424	1	i absolutely agree with this it is my go to move i also go an extra step and pregame my excuse ill mention will well how much i have to help someone over the weekend so when i do go to duck out early from the party my coworkers say oh that is right you have that thing well see ya later thanks for coming byalso yes go dark on sm smart advice

1426	1	bro you acting like black girls are a flavor of ice cream youve never had this is pure comedy skskaskkssksk
1427	1	same i was always the ethnic looking one whatever that means both my sisters are white passing
1428	1	im not being rude im giving my experiences and my piece of the pie to the conversation the minute i gave an unpopular opinion because a lot of women are scared to say it im victim and black women shaming thats offensive youre not even listening to me when i state theres women who likes this due to a trend theres nothing i said wrong about that bc im not talking about the average female nor any female on here do you even think toxic black women exist
1429	1	well first of all i have no idea what you are trying to get across in that first paragraph nobody has a natural right to oppress anyone actually oppression is the act of taking away rightssecondly in feminism just like any other political theory when we reference specific groups men white people straight people we are not making sweeping statements as you have implied but rather criticizing these groups as a social class maybe look into the term social class and other sociological terms
1430	1	omg thank you like can we as black peopleswomen level the fuck up she wasted money on 5 luxury cars and cant even drive  good for cardi for securing her bag but the more i learn about her im just kinda turned off especially when she keeps posting videos about offsets dick
1431	1	im hearing stories that other caribbean countries about the same thing  hell i think there was even a news article recently speaking on how china is essentially attempting to colonize these countries they offer aid
1432	1	yes really all skinfolk aint kinfolk
1433	1	that is not my code for anything just because it is yours doesnt mean that applies for everyone im tired of seeing something means just that im tired of seeing somethinggo back to that social etiquette class
1434	1	thats exactly what i thought shes beautiful
1435	1	this was beautifully written you put into words everything ive felt but was too jumbled to articulate
1436	1	gtbecause i understand on some level that i probably love my skin color in part because society also seems to like it its like a white person realizing they like being a white in a way and feeling conflicted by thati still dont get it
1437	1	i love her intro to finesse but i think i just like the retro 90 is hiphop vibe altogetherand yeah that is about itedit almost forgot i like it can get it
1438	1	women must see themselves through the eyes of men even in their own spaces even in their own minds god forbid a woman has the briefest moment of freedom from the omnipresent phantasmal male gaze that controls so much of her own life and perceptions she must be corrected doesnt she know the men are there mocking her she must be reminded god forbid a woman takes a moments rest from caring about the feelings and desires of men
1439	1	tbf she lumped herself with them we didnt
1440	1	i came here to say this she looks fine as hell to me pretty face and gorgeous body
1441	1	that sub was banned there is a thread about it in againsthatesubreddits
1442	1	maybe it depends on what is mentioned or perhaps starting a new post would be better im not sure of the guidelines here i just comment on things p what sorts of things do you want to discuss
1443	1	did you block his number yet jesus
1444	1	exactly im not dark enough to get in but im glad it exists ill continue to watch her videos and support her as well
1445	1	gti feel that my habits are very damaging i keep things in that are bothering me and i ignore them while trying to do well in school and trying to work hard at my job but once im alone everything just comes back at me and i get emotional its going to take some time but i really hope to find ways and help of letting my hurt go and finding peace and happiness at the same time im scared of taking that leap because im not used to letting people see how vulnerable i can be but i know im gonna have to do it for my sakethis is a healthy perspectiveim guessing youre younger late teensearly twenties and let me tell you that my life would be so different if id known and actually believed this twenty years ago i stuffed all of my feelings down for so many years in an attempt to avoid inconveniencing others and to refrain from bringing attention to myself and it really impacted my healthboth physical and mentalin an extremely negative way i wouldnt wish that on anyonefrom what ive experienced and seen there is a lot of pressure on black women to refrain from expressing things like sadness hurt anger vulnerability etc and it is a fucking crime get comfortable with feeling those things and expressing them as that is the only way a person can really process the experience that caused those feelings  take care sis and happy new year
1446	1	im not being hyper cynical but i dont see the point of excusing that family and falling somewhere in the middleand you know what i meant by princess
1447	1	i havent before but im seriously considering it im tired of trying to link up with friends or family it hardly ever works out
1448	1	i feel this i keep snaps of my friends cats and i just wanna block em
1449	1	thank you
1450	1	honestly i dont think men of any race really respect women all that much the black men v black women issue just seems skewed because a were black so that is what we see and b for whatever reason we equate respect with marriage
1451	1	treat yourself
1452	1	do you just like to go around and view the world as black and white lol
1453	1	make your own threads
1454	1	why put mental health in quotes
1455	1	i agree that this sub should go private  mods please consider it
1456	1	you realize that males and females are not wired the same way right so it makes sense that they dont have the same goals and worries its not morally wrong to discuss it plus its really hard for black women to go through the bad males to get to the good ones besides it doesnt matter if there are good males if they are abdicating responsibility and not addressing the issue either so we can talk about that as wellas for the response when you talk about nb men and their racism well youre hanging around the wrong people then why dont you make a thread about it then this thread comprises 00001 of black people
1457	1	actually french montana is actually part somalil

1461	1	what was the twist
1462	1	i actually get what she is saying celebrity gossip has created the impression that all celeb marriages are either just for show or are open marriages she is saying she didnt think his sleeping around was a deal breaker for cardi that she thought their marriage was more about the power couple image than actually being a conventional couple with the usual fidelity expectations i put it to you that hers is not an unreasonable assumption hiphop relationships trend toward permissive
1463	1	thank you your experience is valuable to me and i appreciate you sharing them with me and yes as i said we talked at length about what he feels what i feel what it may be like raising biracial children and how our families would react he is never said anything that would cause me pause but like you said it is a fear it would be heartbreaking if i were wrong you know
1464	1	gt every single argument youve made has already come from white people in defense of colorismprotest of intentional spaces as well as people who dont see a need for womanism when feminism already exists do you have a survey for that that is like saying since hitler was a vegetarian that eating only vegetables is bad that has nothing to do with the validity of the argument gtok i dont know what to tell you on that front i did read your responses i just dont agree with most of your pointswell your responses sounded as if you didnt actually read it since you were going on a whole spiel about the pain of colorism when im already aware of it your argument basically boils down to colorism is evil therefore it doesnt matter how the victims respond to the situation they are completely justified to do whatever theyre want anyone who disagrees doesnt understand the pain of colorismgtim not angry but so what if i was anger has validity and so does an individuals desire to remove themselves from harm again same old tired bullshitnumber one anger isnt always productive or the best way to handle a situation you can be completely justified in being angry but responding to everything with anger that is not healthy and you know it if youre responding to everything with anger then you absolutely do need better coping skills im  not saying you have to be completely happy and peaceful like a saint either youre also not removing yourselves from harm because newsflash racism and colorism isnt just perpetuated by light skinned people including dark skinned women no one is getting harmed with a forum that is open to the outside world dont be dramatic i understand that the victims may be been exposed to trauma in their own lives but i dont see them purposely avoiding spaces with light skinned people or only associating with light skinned people every dark skinned person i have seen associates with everyone on the spectrum and they come out okay at the end of the day an exclusive forum for dark skinned people isnt bad but that is not what im arguinggti havent experienced this level of derailing in a looooong timenewsflash someone disagreeing with you isnt derailing go get educated on what derailing is youre thinking with your emotions instead of facts or someone else is argument if you dont like it then maybe leave go make your own forum and make it private argue with yourself in  your own forum and echo chamber that should make you feel bettergtyou dont know what people deal with in their daytoday you dont know how much healthy discourse people are engaging in all day every day irlnever said i did but getting defensive at the mere suggestion of health discourse isnt solving the problem either make a post about your own story then no one is stopping yougtim in favor of giving people a space where they can seek fellowship commiserate and relax if this vetting method is going to be what it takes to allow her to do so in the space that she creates im all for ityou mistakenly believe that this method she is using will lead to a utopia of peace im saying that is naive and off base if she cant see that shell have problems even after people get vetted whatever that means then she shouldnt own a forum and be an administrator especially to hop on the trend of catering to dark skinned women gtwelcome to the internet friend i read what you wrote and only deemed a small percentage of it worthy of a reply the idea that there is a proper way to address your argument implies youre somehow entitled to my timeenergy  you are notif im not entitled to your time and energy why waste your time reading my argument and replying you cant write everything off as racist or colorist drivel if you only deemed a small percentage of it worthy as  a reply maybe it speaks to how you know youre not totally right and you dont want to defend your views i replied to every single thing that you said but i guess the favor cant be returned for me go figure
1465	1	youre not wrong but we arent gonna see an apology from him why because he is a piece of shit who cant keep it in his pants i just hope cardi gets better from this
1466	1	your being half filipino probably plays into it after all youll have to deal with that part of your heritage as wellit is funny the only people who ever pressured me to act a certain way or were disappointed when i didnt act the way they believed black people should act were white people the black people i know have always just been normal  this happened in my 20s though so maybe we were just more mature by that point as well i didnt know any black teenagers in my teens unfortunately

1478	1	this told me more than i needed to know about you and its not good but im sure you dont notice that so whatever as for me i graduated from uc berkeley and have been actively working to increase the numbers of black students at uc campuses across california while working for a few different organizations around oakland that are trying to stop the prison industrial complex and end police brutality complain all you want but people like me dont care to hear it and calling me coonish like we are bigoted kindergarteners isnt changing that

1485	1	im actually amazed people think this sub is an oasis lmao
1486	1	this is so truemore attention isnt necessarily a good thing id rather get approached by one good guy than 10 crappy ones
1487	1	this is a great mentality to have  i see people of other races helping out their own but rarely see black people helping other black people get their foot in the door we need more of that

1494	1	i appreciate this feedback my experience with nursing comes from the receiving end actually ive been in hospitals quite a bit both for myself and for family members to the point where i have quite a bit of curiosity and now i think it is time to learn what all a nurse does the pay is another motivating factor but yes things like losing a patient will no doubt be difficult and im weighing that into my decision i appreciate you mentioning this very much
1495	1	thank you i already orderd them
1496	1	eh not totally free of it lots of fetishizing and stuff especially in pms
1497	1	for some reason rampb doesnt seem to have the sub genre diversification other genres have i think shes in the realm but theres probably something more soecific
1498	1	exactly why are people still pretending to themselves sugar daddies arent simply sexual predators like weinstein or crosby every single one of them one cant keep complaining about men preying on women and girls while pretending their wealth  isugar isnt as a result of plundering the poor and unearned societal privilege of sex daddy race etc i mean do you but im not here for the glamorization of such wealth or the wages  of  isugaring up or leaning in the white feminist version
1499	1	yep mainline shadowrun is a nightmare but i play shadowrun anarchy which has way more improv opportunities and way less matha bit of shameless promotion but i host an actual play podcasthttpsthetalentagencypodbeancom in it and a few other game systems in the same genre with more blackness and queerness than your average show
1500	1	nice to meet a fellow exjw
1501	1	i dont think you can or even should always avoid white academic spaces but people have to be honest about the choices they make i think one of the most important ways to cope is nonwhite extracurricular time and being honest with your children about the environments theyre in ive seen enough black and brown people who send their children into these environments but then choose to spend their free time in spaces and activities that are just as white if not worse everyone needs a break and a place to be normal also parents have to have their children is back 10 times harder if theyre sending them into a social warzone and they cant pretend that everything is ok or inherently worth it no colorblind bs or defending racist teachers  even if they arent confronting teachers and admin directly that is hard children need to know that they arent crazy and that they have support outside of school i saw so much of my own life in that story and i really think what helped me is my parents and family openly acknowledging how bad racist white people are and being open with me why they made the choices they did it was clear that the things i dealt with were things i was enduring for a reason and not ok also i always had the option of leaving after middle school and i did
1502	1	gt i think people are upset at the idea or concept of a rich pastor it flies in the face of the messages of humility jesus espoused but let is be honest would most people be willing to support a fulltime pastor so he could live without working a 95 jobmost black people i know yes and they do i know too many who love the idea of a rich pastor i do though think some of the people upset with him are irritated that he even has the funds to do something like he did for his wifegtjust like i see with youtubers who create ecourses selling their knowledge john gray is selling his expertise via books it is an entrepreneurial skill  create a brand and then monetize it it is how he eatsgthis relationship with his wife is a separate conversation to me but as a pastor writing books and creating content is how he makes a living personally i dont believe pastors should get as much leeway to draw lines between vocation and their job as leaders i do think in most cases a pastor is marriage is their own but once they start letting the public have glimpses in and advertising what goes on in the marriage on social media they wave a lot of that pass gti am not a christian so im already unbothered by these shenanigans but i think it would be nice if black churches used their influence to get the community financially literate im somewhat machiavellian so i dont believe pastors would be more esteemed if they were poor generally people would be turned off because there is no glory in poverty i believe the same thing but also that there is a ton of country between poverty and italian sports cars i also dont think pastors or any leaders should be esteemed in the first place respected yes but not esteemedgtto solve this we should use the black church as a place to learn about financial freedom just a thoughti think there is conflict here between the reason people attend church how money works and how most leaders are elevated but that is a lot of separate conversations but at the same time i know quite a few churches that are stepping up on that front i wish more would
1503	1	true all men of color can get it tbh but i feel like asian guys are way underrated in general
1504	1	people equate press with acceptance imo just because topics involving black people get a lot of attention doesnt mean our struggle is understood or cared about
1505	1	beat me to it i literally forgot about ops hair looking at her skin
1506	1	can you elaborate
1507	1	oh cool i did not know they were an item or that they had a child together
1508	1	i was friends with a nigerian kid in school i think i still have him on facebook going from his name and this is probably very wrong because i cant remember which dialect he spoke id say ohmeanah or ohmayna the oh could be soft though so like ah
1509	1	that is barely even nuance tbh it is blatant situational context theyre mostly remedial when it comes to anything social
1510	1	yes that would be cool
1511	1	im personally not meeting up with anyone that im worried about im damn sure not going to ask a friend to come along and put that friend in harms way idk maybe im just old but third wheeling is weirdmen can overpower two women without a weaponlisten to your gutmeet in a very public placelet a friend know where youre going and maybe have them on stand by to help bail you out if the guy drove

1515	1	gt this is an intersectional sub sexism exists
1516	1	thanks im just trying to do a little bit to be the change i wanna see in the world tbh i wish i saw more black women in my wedding planning endeavors it wouldve been really helpful like not even just dresses i made sure i saw that my photographer had done a wedding of at least one black couple before i hired them because i wanted to make sure they knew how to edit my skin tone but so many of the photogs i saw hadnt done one
1517	1	gtin an ideal world this would be the case but a disturbing percentage of the population does not respectadhere to stated boundaries if it is an open group there are always going to be a large amount of trollshaters in the group taking up timeemotional resourcesi hate this logic we dont live in an ideal world but you dont have to make it any worse if you feel trolls take up emotional resources then read what i told another user gtyou dont run and hide in real life why is a forum any different i feel like people here and on that forum if she institutes such a policy need to focus more on coping methods and defense mechanisms rather than trying to be in unrealistic hypercontrolled environments dark skinned people are not bubble boys hyperinsulation from the outside world can harm them not benefit them catering to dark skinned women will always be divisive to an extent there are better ways to bring more people to your side than this kind of behaviorplus if youre worried about trolls there are better ways to counteract this behavior dark skinned women can be trolls as well take a look at what i wrotegtas people have said before skin folk are not kin folk that applies to dark skinned women she doesnt even have to do this if she wants to make sure everyone is on the same page she should just hire some moderators for the forum which any forum administrator should do anyway and she should make every new member including the moderators sign some kind of application including who they are their name nice facts like their birthday location etc on the application they should say what they think the purpose of the forum is why they want to join the forum what they can contribute to the forum and how they can actually contribute to the stigmatization of colorism in their own communities for the moderators an extra step could be why they want to moderate a forum such as this and what they will do to combat inappropriate content trolling and derailment they could also include their experience moderating as well a troll whether theyre dark skinned or not isnt going to go through all that effort and different people will use a different kind of language she shouldnt try to use pictures as a substitute for what she should be doing anyway ive seen one person on here say one thing and then do a complete 180 and act like a different person on other subreddits the same can and will happen with women she deems dark enough since theyre not a monolithgtnobody is saying that ls women dont have their own struggles but stay in your lanea light skinned woman can offer valuable experience about their own privilege dark skinned women only see from the outside looking in but you dont always get to hear from light skinned women that are aware of their own privilege besides i addressed this kind of derailment in the quote above if you actually read it gtfull disclosure i think im just somewhere in the middle but i do read the conversations because if it impacts my sisters  it impacts mei dont like this because it only makes people want to  measure their blackness and their darkness and honestly we shouldnt be focusing on that yes not everyone is the same skin color but darkness or blackness has absolutely nothing to do with your mindset at all the sooner people like us realize that the better
1518	1	this doesnt really help cause it is still suggesting there is a context where you can say homie to a friend for example in the case of nigga there is not a context where a nonblack person can say it not to a friend not in song lyrics not even in  a note to themselves
1519	1	ok good to know still seems as a weird thing to try and trademark as dia de los muertos but what do i know edit well what do you know just watched this youtube vidhttpsmyoutubecomwatchv4mrzbwuumkk and there is a coincidental corroboration at 313
1520	1	directly
1521	1	adam sandler is career begs to differ if you can show me where hart is comedy shows notable growth from highschool level jokes ill change my opinion but i dont see it i believe hart and maybe even harvey have a natural talent for reading a room and maybe even timing but i dont see any growth to indicate that theyve moved beyond appealing to the highschool student in their fans someone like chapelle is different he seems to respect his craft and you can see progress across his career even though he did top out at the limit of his own social awareness
1522	1	your story is not my story i didnt entertain men i knew werent good for me i didnt know they werent good for me until i was already in the situation your story is a story it is not the story there are plenty of women and girls being hurt by people they had no idea were dangerous or bad until they were already in too deep experienced women ignoring bad guys does absolutely nothing to solve the situation those women are in women shouldnt have to be hurtscarred in order to build up a wall and learn who to ignore men should just freaking do better
1523	1	oh yes i loved tokyo great place to people watch and there are lots of good looking dudes there
1524	1	tldr at the bottom i think they dont know what to think  mostly in stem and tech natural is fine   sales and finance is totally differentbased on what some pals have said they think natural means not a weave im not being an apologist just sharing what i have observed when their hair doesnt lay flat it is because they either didnt take care of it or they did something to it so it wouldnt lay flat  they forget or dont realize ours doesnt lay flat without lots of effort remember some think straight hair grows out of everybodys head  i know people who think thissadly i think for sales finance or whoever has an issue with natural hair the best options right now are buns  they wont understand a puff or locs  microbraids might be an option what is depressing and outrageous is that it wont be ok unless a  kardashian or miley cyrus does it and makes a splashwhat i think is worse is body type  if you sit upon anything other than a pancake youre at risk of being accused of trying to wear sexy clothing or worse  youre not wearing anything racy it is just that you may have more hip andor cushion this happens to busty women tooboth of these tie back to european beauty standards were only 13 of the us population  most nonpoc will not ever interact withus as peers eg neighbors classmates or friendship circles they only know what they see on tv which is patheticthe scary thing is that i doubt it is on purpose that is more terrifying because you cannot convince them there are any issues under these circumstances  left coast liberals are a prime example  theyll wear blm tee shirts but wont speak any poc in person who isnt their waiter nail technician or mechanic  these terrors are folks i get introduced to  then they tell me to go into dampi because im such a nice nonthreatening black person and legitimately believe they are complimenting me  ive had the misfortune of dating a few of these i was usually the gf after the asian girlfriend or if the guy was asian im next after the white girlfriend but i moved to where there were actually black people i digress tldryou are right  the quick and dirty mitigation is to wear ones hair in a bun and accentuate your eyes brows and lashes this is not the best  i am tempted to research this even casually  we need to know more and share it to make working and career advancement easier for each other
1525	1	i literally have heard pretty much this exact phrase except he said ethnic titties
1526	1	unfortunately thats not enough for most people and assumes we all have the same baseline of common sense
1527	1	minnesota represent sounds abt right
1528	1	who cares what whites think im tired of seeing black people feel like they have to police themselves just because some no life having whites are always trying to see what were doing i agree with you i dont like the bm vs bw shit were not enemies but we can and should discuss shitty thinking and behavior within our community
1529	1	i want one too hahaa why didnt we have this growing up i was stuck with dolls who didnt look like me or have hair like me
1530	1	ive only ever lived in socal and ive been seeing this sentiment about it a lot lately is it really that bad i thought is was great living here because of all the diversity i mean i definitely dont see black people as much as other races but i assumed this was the best place to live as a black person other than the south when it comes to diversity are there overwhelmingly better places and im just clueless
1531	1	same i would unabashedly weep
1532	1	problem is that i cant detangle im 3 months post with shampoo only
1533	1	at least in my experience nonwestern women tend to be a lot more matter of fact about dating and marriage it is like right or not offensive or not how do we get you with somebody older ones especially you could be at a funeral and theyll sit you down to give you advice i read your story completely different than if it had been a regular american white woman but it still kind of sucks especially right after a breakup
1534	1	cmon sis well go see it together
1535	1	what isnt applicable to this situation
1536	1	focusing on yourself is so worthwhile loving yourself takes time to learn i support you in your journey
1537	1	i think using available resources and taking the time to learn and create a plan is the opposite of willy nilly that is why i shared it i honestly never considered 95 of the topics covered and that is just from doing my first quick scan through the site also you can do good things in your community without starting a nonprofit that is just one of the topics covered
1538	1	this is me too  i want a good man so bad like all my other peers its sad  its like somethings wrong with me my career is going awesome i already graduated and im taking a gap year to work on getting ready for medical school what do we do it makes me depressed too
1539	1	the wayans aww dang i didnt even know im afraid to even look that up
1540	1	i like your style  sounds like the way i would be  id rather do without the whole rigmarole but if youre gonna harass me until i do it your way dont question the way i do it dammit  lol
1541	1	im not tryna act like glover doesnt like white ladies or asian ladies i mean thats not a secret and i agree that a lot of black dudes do as you say i mean its none of my business to police their sexual activities all i meant was that a lot of stories stand up comics tell are fake or highly rewritten so that they are actually funny
1542	1	i think the issue was that he felt he apologized for them before and didnt want to again which in a way i get but it wasnt blanket not apologizing
1543	1	white people dont want her  it wasnt that long ago that italians were just whites on a leash as long as they behaved aglosaxon

1549	1	gt ok i read what you wrote and i disagree youre oversimplifying how much bullshit people deal with in the real world you dont feel a need for safer spaces in your life that is fine but dont assert that nobody needs them and that the solution to the problem is better coping mechanisms that is lowkey victim blamingit is not victim blaming i never said there wasnt a need for safe spaces i just said her approach is missing the mark stop acting like a victim and like your way is totally right when someone says that maybe you can handle things in a different way black people are not the only people that want safe spaces depressive patients cancer patients and other minorities need and want safe spaces as well however as any therapist will tell you you also need to develop coping mechanisms to survive in the real world it is not victim blaming to say that it is for you no man is an island and this life isnt perfect the only way you can truly escape is death we all deserve a therapeutic space from time to time however in real life when someone disturbs that therapeutic space they get kicked out they dont get screened by skin color gthire moderators for a web forum most of the people i know who moderate web forums do it for freeno shit i didnt mean they had to be paid perhaps hire wasnt the right word gtand yes anyone has the opportunity to troll the forum but like you said itwhat she is requiringis a lot of effort for someone to go throughlol you are so naive anyone can take a photo of dark skin and claim theyre a black person it is not a lot of work this isnt 1920 anyone can be around a black person and take their black friend say theyre dark skinned gtagain youre totally missing the point this is not a let ls women talk about their privilege space therefore nobody wants to hear it you missed my point i was saying it would and could be a great experience and discussion to have a light skinned women talk about her privilege fromher point of view it doesnt mean they would be bragging about it or denying it im talking about a light skinned person affirming the privilege you already know she hasgtand i can understand why people in an affirming and safer space that is centered around ds women dont want the space centered around the privilegeexperiences of ls womenwho says it would be though light skinned women arent going to benefit from anything there anyway since theyre not her target demographic so just let nature take its course gti understand this and i suspect the women in the forum do as well but as i said earlier we dont live in an ideal world and the  isolutions you proposed completely ignore the fact that colorism exists and that it has both psychological as well as physical effectsit doesnt ignore that colorism exists at all i think youre ignoring the fact that dark skinned women subject to colorism can actually contribute to colorism themselves just like there are racist and colorist black folks of any shade youre just ignoring what im saying ans going on about the effects of colorism i cant take you seriously because it doesnt sound like you actually read what i said i am aware of the effects of colorism however it seems like you want to sit there in anger and hyperinsulate yourself from the outside world which is not a healthy coping mechanism and does nothing to solve the problem healthy discourse can should help and people dont focus enough on that gtpeople need intentional spaces to heal from the trauma you might not need it but i dont understand why it is so hard for you to understandacknowledge why someone else mightagain you clearly didnt read what i said and you are merely being defensive and emotional i never said someone else might not if that is all you took from what i said im afraid were done here where did i say a forum like hers wasnt needed all im saying is she is going about it the wrong way heck what she is doing is self serving at best youre holding chrissy up as this savior for dark skinned women when she clearly has her own motives as well gtim going to invite you to take a minute to reflect on what i and others have said hereyou mean you want me to reflect on things that i already knew while not actually reading or addressing my argument properly and instead read your reply which is basically you throwing your emotions back at me because i did
1550	1	amazing
1551	1	lmfao this is so real and so relatable

1553	1	the same can be said of nearly anythingviolent does not equal bad i feel you are trying to repackage judgement into somthing more intellectually pleasant
1554	1	okay im only asking because if she can get proof from all of the other times he was late or didnt want to pay then the court will be in her favor just because he dont want to pay an extra curricular doesnt mean he isnt a unfit father in some states so im asking so she doesnt waste her time

partners and may have less social capital and bargaining power in romantic relationships this study sheds light on the driving forces behind african american women is interracial dating experiences to determine if they are being driven by african american women is preference to date men a specific racialethnic group african american white and hispanic or if interracial dating  is steered by potential partners is prefence not to date african american womena way to explain how the more educated black women go for black men is thisgtthe education factor could be explained in part by historically black colleges and universities hbcus and the persistent segregation of educational institutions even among institutes of higher education qian amp lichter 2007httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc4509521r41 this segregation would continue to limit the opportunities of individuals to date white men as they go through higher education so although intentions may rise with education opportunities for interracial relationships may still remain relatively low in addition to these factors residential and religious segregation persist limiting opportunities for social contact dating and intermarriage between african americans and whites feliciano et al 2009httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc4509521r17 luke 2012httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc4509521r32 massey amp denton 1993httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc4509521r34even though this study only applies to women in kentucky another reason to explain the disparity between educated black women and more economically disadvantaged black women is thisgtsecond is important to note the statistically significant difference between interracial relationship behaviors and intentions with white men as compared to hispanic men there are a number of possible factors at play in this disparity it could be an access issue such that there is an increased social and geographic distance between african americans and hispanics as compared to african americans and whites in kentucky thus hispanic men are not seen as viable relationship options and african american women report low intentions to date hispanic men alternatively the respondents could have generally held less favorable views toward hispanic men as partners compared to white men bogardus 1933httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc4509521r6 owen eisner amp mcfaul 1981 pagnini amp morgan 1990httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc4509521r39 this may be particularly important for economically disadvantaged african american women as they may be more willing to seek out interracial partnerships with men in the most privileged racial category in the us third potential partners relationship preferences play a large role in interracial relationship behaviors the opportunities for african american women to date outside their race may be restricted as they may not be sought out as potential partners for example the study on white internet daters noted that white men preferred not to date african americansthe study suggests that not only are poorer black women more likely to date out of the race especially white men but that it is not the woman is choices that drive the rates of interracial marriage but the preference of their potential partners for economically disadvantaged women they cant afford to be picky in their dating pool perhaps because they want to find a means of surviving and relying on a stable income their poverty is a hindrance to a better life so it is no surprise they would be attracted to a privileged white man as opposed to a poor black man and especially when the black men in their dating pool are few for the educated black women the study suggests that their preference is due to proximity and not necessarily due to preference even though overall black women with more cultural mistrust were less likely to date outnext

1557	1	gti actually solidified my thought of actually liking him forreal this weekend the next day i see this shitif that is not a sign from the universe telling you he is not the one for you i dont know what is
1558	1	thank you so much
1559	1	gt yes he does have multiple streams of income but the world views him as a pastor and not as a philantropist it is easy to say that people should not be hypocritical but arent leaders held to a higher standard regardless of income status and popularity jesus could have easily came with chariots horses and the likes but he was a humble servant now was it wrong for him to purchase the vehicle for his wife out of his own funds no however it should have been done more discretely instead of blasting it for the whole world to take notice youthis says it very well especially that part ive sat through and read enough pastors and pastoral leadership counselors having this conversation to know that this wasnt really a difficult call on his part the fact that he didnt know or maybe even care is what rubs me the wrong way the most
1560	1	that edit has been there this entire time but ill just let you see what you want to see youve already made the decision to be offended and it seems like you cant not be so at this moment
1561	1	are you on mobile sometimes you have to be on a desktop to access private subreddits afaik
1562	1	i cosign those kocationsob was where id sneak off to clear my head  it is kind of like berkeley with a beachi used to live downtown
1563	1	gtlet is not pretend they dont distort history for their own benefit or know everything tooyeah but some just follow along with it who is they the white people or us gtpart of me feels like this sub can be an echo chamberyeah but when we echo this we get exploited negatively not to mention theres been numerous of times we try to give whites a chance but they end up twisting our story to fit their narrative which often leaves a negative stigma amongst black people especially black women
1564	1	nothing special honestly video games all kinds except sports and rts anime astronomy fantasyish things cons and just general typical stuff

1569	1	your appreciative post is a one off there is tons of misogyny and misogynoir in bf just go look worry about what the men folk are doing im not going to discuss with you if this post is problematic or not you dont get a say imagine if a white person busted into bf with some notallwhites bullshit asking to be seen as an individual that is what your doing right now this is your warning that you will be banned if you keep it up

1574	1	i wanted to mention this but i was too lazy to type it out
1575	1	gta vegan diet is not sustainable or even economic for most people despite what vegans will tell you however it is even worse for marginalized folk because they really cant be picky about what they eat or afford to experiment i agree with that to an extent marginalized folx live in areas where vegan products are not accessible and often far more expensive than in white privileged areas you cant be picky about what you eat if you barley have anything to eat however if black veganism is given the chance and becomes accessible for black people it is far cheaper and healthier capitalism and white supremacy is the source for such circumstancesgt talking down on them is off base also foreign or indigenous dishes may be more or less vegan than outside dishes and it is a part of their culture that should be respected exactly theres a long history of white people making fun off dishes that are different from their cuisine gt ellen a rich white woman had trouble keeping up with the lifestyle even though she would have the best access to the best vegan resources so that says a loti cant really speak on that everyones experience is different and you definitely need to approach it from your own angle i for one dont eat meat substitutes not saying eating them is a bad thing i just eat different things

1593	1	no its going ahead to cancel it would be undemocratic the people voted leave im not happy about it but to have a second referendum wouldnt make sense when a decision has already been made you cant just cancel it because it didnt go how you wanted it would make the situation 10x worse  its david camerons fault for proposing a vote in the first place i dont think any politician thought the country would vote out
1594	1	lol
1595	1	it is important to find what works well for each individual i walk with a cane myself because it is innocuous i also have the muscle to use it as a club im well aware that is not always an option just like not everywoman is going to be comfortable using a firearmpepper spray is the thing though if nothing else it takes little expertise or training and is highly effective at disabling someone it does come with the caveat of wearing good running shoes which is fine it is ok to run just dont do what i did and use it all up on your scrambled eggs

1601	1	dang whats wrong with the gift
1602	1	thanks
1603	1	whats the point of giving them the benefit he showed you who he was from jump its up to you to believe it and keep it pushing my patience with men in generally is itty bitty now days but white men they better not even breath wrong if they dont wanna get blocked
1604	1	your ignorant opinion you did a shitty job at calling yourself upholding is noted and ignored
1605	1	thank you it really does suck
1606	1	personally ive been expecting his name to come up eventually he reminds me of cosby in a lot of ways so im prone to believe it most men just dont deal well with having that much talent and intelligence on top of attention from white men
1607	1	older 50 black men are friendly yep but im not trying to date them  my main interest in meeting men was to get married and have kidsraise a familybe partnerssavvor by south station is a great space for black events for younger people under 30 though im not sure how relationship oriented the men are there but i bet you could find a guy there who would be a decent boyfriend for awhile or if youre just looking for male friendship you could probably make friends really easily there is also def a lively artentrepreneur scene which you can find through fb and ig but again im not sure about potential for serious partnership if youre interest in men is mainly platonicsocial youd do wellbut for dating and starting families the scene here is terrible for black women looking for black men my black female friends and black women i meet are single the most and the longest  even the really attractive intelligent women the kind generous women the outgoing down for anything women it is ridiculous for women under 40 looking for men under 40 it is slim pickings unless you datemarry someone you knew in elementary school or high schooli havent seen black women with many races of men here it is usually black occasionally white or nothing i dont know that boston area latinasian men have any interest in serious committed partnership with black women from what ive seenheard they dont but my sample is small enough that i cant say i know for suresorry for the long reply this is a topic ive journalled about and talked about at length for a very long time so i have lots of words and ready made thoughts about it
1608	1	i was in kyoto in july and i regret not hitting a club or two up  would love to hear about your experience in tokyo
1609	1	porches start at 60k which is within the realm of a middle class purchase even if upper middle class i wouldnt have liked it but it wouldnt have been worth commenting on if that is where your line is that is for you to justify ive already told you where my line is and i know whythe reason being that a pastor shouldnt be coming ion well over middle class purchasing habits especially in a capitalist and exploitative country ampx200bchurch funds are part of the conversation because you said this in response to someone elsegtit is disgusting how many people do not even know what the rolemeaning of a pastor should be pastor shouldnt be driving a lambo having a private plane using church funds to buy the new xbox or creeping around fucking everyone in the churchi agree with this except the xbox lol like it is a 300 game systemgt but   i dont care enough about this to bring this thread into a new day as a christian you should care especially if you cared enough to defend it in the first place because this is an issue for all of us but have a nice day
1610	1	that is true especially with molly since i felt like she was ignored by everyone btw i love your username
1611	1	fuck whole foods and they over priced groceries and their symbolism of modern colonization aka gentrification ampx200band honestly white supremacists dgaf about how much education you have they just see black skin and automatically think thieves smh at this shit show of an anti black world yo smh
1612	1	it certainly seems like it   i find it confusing why the leaders of such churches would be conspicuous consumers  i know local pastors who came to the pulpit later in life who had earned luxury homes and cars in their previous professions thats believable bit the longer they were in the pulpit the older and older those cars got because you could see that thymey werent keeping up with the joneses anymoreit is just as easy to get another less expensive luxury car on a believable salary and rent the ultra high end cars on her birthday or wedding anniversaryi can respect someone working hard and saving and purchasing what they want im concerned that they arent walking the walk im concerned those cars are coming from the coffers of the impoverished  i would much rather see money spent on saving homeless who have been displaced by gentrification  i dont follow his shows so i dont know if he displays the good he does for people but i hope so  i really hope he inspires people to go out and do good more than just donating to this parish sometimes we all have more time than money
1613	1	ill start by saying i agree with a lot of what she saidbut i also 100 agree with you even beyond reddit fighting between blacks happens on a public stage and makes us look bad and other races of people use the information they get from observing these fights against us like its true even black people say that black women are xy and z i dont see her tweet as a fight just a commentary but i bet that if i looked at the responses to that tweet theres going to be some black men and women insulting each other also on the black gossip blogs i follow i now avoid the comments on posts about famous people in irr because it just gets ugly
1614	1	gtthere is no way there is not something problematic with a social media presence going back that longi dont think the issue is the fact that people dosay problematic things as much as it is the way people respond to being called out it seems they take one of two options either have your pr person write a faux apology while expecting things to go back to normal or make a personal sincere apology and try to grow from the experience without repeating the same bullshit
1615	1	the queen literally decides when they all eatwhat they can wear etc im just shocked anyone would choose that but i grew out out the wow id love to be a princess  phase years ago and dont find anything about the royal family even the least bit appealing royaltyruling classclassism racism sexism so she wants to what breakdown the system while actively and eagerly participating idk to each their own maybe shell do some good
1616	1	as youre subscribed to a sub called black chicks white dicks
1617	1	thank you
1618	1	i will definitely do that because i come off as a timid person who constantly gets pushed around and im tired of that i hate men dominating me
1619	1	honestly i didnt invest much i wish i could say i invested thousands but it was very modesthowever everyone i loaned money repaid quickly including any interest  my crypto tanked eth but doge was niftyit was really worth it and i wish i had invested moreeach borrower made a small loan and paid me a lumpsumbtw i love that gif
1620	1	i second queer women of color yo im definitely apart of that one it is a bit dead and it is only person in there posting their youtube videos in there a lot but other than that it is cool
1621	1	lol i saaaame i see this all the time on this sub and im like i cant relate  the most i get is probably white guys saying i look like every mixed black celebrity with long straight hair
1622	1	seems like it
1623	1	thats totally not what i meant  but i understand why you thought that it was more that we focus on the negative so much that we ignore the positives and strides that our people are taking im a huge believer in you can be what you can see and so far we really push all these negative stories and ignore all the things we can do i feel like that is what holds us back and discourages people from trying to reach our goals or even set them it more like if you hear you will always have a disadvantage or bias against you in hiring will you apply for that dream job if you hear that no one wants to be with a black woman will you ever flirt with men you find attractive mindset means a whole lot and you miss 100 of the shots you dont take
1624	1	i feel you on the career path when i decided to go back to school a year and a half ago i was 100 deadset on a particular career but as i continued to take classes my desire for the original plan sort of dissipated 2019 is definitely the year of soul searching and trying to figure out what is next for me best of luck to you in 2019
1625	1	it is not about us it is about him it is very clear he is never actually spent any time in this sub lol
1626	1	how do you even join lol and when i click on links from others posts it says it was deleted im so confused lol
1627	1	because im not a party person persay as long as you give me food water and sleep im good loool
1628	1	it is exhausting to hear but there isnt a deadline to start dating except death  i remember beinf worried about getting a prom date  i went with a palalso where ai am from there is no such thing as a girl being too tall  keep in mind that it can be challenging to determine when a guy is interested especially at that age only the really assertive and confident ones will ask someone out it isnt a reflection of how attractive you are
1629	1	ok so this might be potentially problematic but i am into how much italians are into black women ive travelled a bit and i know being fetishised is an issue but i will take it over being invisible like i have in so many places lol
1630	1	yeah but even there my chest still screaming it aint matching boo ive seen some cream but its likely to be lightening cream and frankly it aint sitting right with me yk putting money in the pocket of an industry who capitalizes mainly from colorism
1631	1	thats the thing idk what my end game would be an email stating i did the program it just seems dramatic we dont work together anymore but after that meeting ive been more vocal about receiving credit my work
1632	1	hmm maybe ill give this a shot the problem is im  always soooo relaxed and lazy after the sauna so the idea of then washing and styling my hair not sure it would happen
1633	1	great days with all the singers is just so stellar
1634	1	awesome yea if they look like the native egyptians then they are almost certainly amazighs there are some amazigh groups that are more white looking and some that are more black looking but two of them that look like native egyptians and are in libya are the tuareg and the toubou i would recommend looking into them as there is a good chance your ancestry is from one of those two groups i hope that helps and good luck finding more information
1635	1	thats my show
1636	1	i mean free time for volunteering can also be a class indicator   tbh for me being vegan is waaaay more convenient than the time investment of mentoring a student   but i get what youre saying also i do have the privilege of living in an area where vegan food is available due to the ethnic communities around me i can also afford to be choosy about what i buy a lot of vegans dont get it because lentils are cheap
1637	1	it is regular popping corn but still on the cob  im curious how it works if there are pieces that dont come off
1638	1	i see some on sephora but they are very expensive
1639	1	i went to one in  virginia very far from goa where indian attire was suggested  the couple even listed shops in the tristate area where you could get some clothes
1640	1	i just cant with cardi and others because she doesnt write her raps its one thing to be a singersongwriter or just a singer because your voice is the instrument but rap quite literally rests on the idea that youre crafting those lyrics yourself this is a genre of music in which you should be writing your own work period youre not a rapper youre a performer
1641	1	those verses apply to all christians not just pastors and some of these dont apply like the proverbs ones how is he withholding good or grain third these speak of being rich in general so if john cant be wealthy according to these none of us should be and he said he didnt spend the churchs money so 20 or 300 xbox if it came from his book sales hes not wrong but speaking of the churchs money surely we expect him to use his actual church salary on himself as far as basic needs maybe thats not what you meant what would yall have him spend his money on if he cant buy an xbox should he give it all away again where is the line and who draws it
1642	1	they dont actually want to fix things  seems like they just like the feeling of moral superiority
1643	1	its a problem if you make it a problem her intention could be anything why assume its a bad one why is it a problem to correct your ignorance
1644	1	your sentence about the tobacco addiction is something i would read on rtumblrinaction loool
1645	1	i think you replied to the wrong person
1646	1	lol i always avoid comments on any nsfw sub but thats good to know
1647	1	lol and it was frunny so i had to put it back in the oven i was feeling myself too much at least the flavor was right
1648	1	yea im starting to learn this too its still hard to voice myself at this stage
1649	1	i know i know but they always have to go there
1650	1	thank you ill try
1651	1	wow im sorry to hear thatl regarding your condition but hope you can find joy in the other things that make you a a selfrealized womanfrom experience i know that some dudes just love to talk and i dont mean that in a bad way but they get good feelings from saying nice things and enjoy the feedback that they receive from saying those nice things it makes them feel good and in theory yes they believe what they say words are a lowcost way to make someone feel great and they make you feel good toobut one of the best pieces of advice that i ever received after years of heartbreak and heartache is dont believe what people say believe what they do like really see what they are doing are they actively making plans asking questions or do they just say something and then go on their way talk is cheapim not saying your guy is all talk at all hes probably just young and still getting things together he says he wants to get engaged because he loves you he does want to spend his life with you but probably doesnt feel the same level of urgency as you do as an older woman
1652	1	pmd you go kick some ass online
1653	1	i googled it to share the link here and it looks like shes started a blog on tumblr about it too infuriating anyway heres the episode httpswwwwnycstudiosorgstorywhyistealdeathsexmoney
1654	1	exactly these sugar babies are sex workers they just dont want to call themselves sex workers because of the stigma these sugar daddies ease them in with a dinner date and a pair of new shoes next things these sugar babies know they are fucking every date in exchange for money and gifts people need to stop lying to themselves
1655	1	thank you this brought up a lot of groups to join
1656	1	gtfeels great after shampoo but as soon as conditioner touches my hair it gets hard and straw like wait youre canadian it could be due to hard water i lived near lake erie growing up amp the water was hard which dried my hair out also wearing a heated cap with the conditioner helps esp with low porosity hair
1657	1	completely random question does new orleans have a higher proportion of households who cook at home compared to other citiesill tell you what when i hear people talk about food on vacation new orleans always gets the most enthusiasm la food trucks are a distant second
1658	1	yeah i agree she needs the kind of treatment you dont get in the united states though
1659	1	yeah youre probably right lol
1660	1	my grandpa died last year i didnt like seeing him uncomfortable seeing our loved ones suffering is hard and so is losing them im sorry for what you amp your grandma are going through i hope you can all find peace in this situation
1661	1	lol its just one of those days it comes sporadically but sometimes in waves
1662	1	i think i get more annoyed because we arent give the same leeway as nbpoc women or white women and i find it so infuriating its so much better for my mental health to not give a fuck though
1663	1	are you having serious conversations about what youre looking for
1664	1	amen sis
1665	1	up to brits to make what decision i dont understand what you mean we dont have a say in them being there im british born here and lived in england all my life they dont have the power or even the influence you think they have the uk parliament is made up of the house of commons and the house of lords the house of lords is bad too because many of the seats are handed down the royals are more like celebrities honestly edit just wanted to wrap it up better without sounding like a prick there are very few british people on this sub ive noticed even here on conversations around england i cant see any british people commenting we may know the history but as of right now the royals are the very very least of our problems
1666	1	can we not blame black women for the behavior of black men theyre adults not children they shouldnt need to constantly be checked in order to act like decent human beings their behavior is on them additionally if you want black women to take on that responsibility the logical conclusion is to stop dating all black men to be safe that is really not a workable solution here what is a workable solution is for black men to start owning their own shit and calling out the fuckery they see other men participate in
1667	1	yeah and i didnt  even see the post when he defended himself till now that was a bad move in my opinion basically doubling down on the homophobia i mean hes said some questionable shit before ya know regarding black women another discussion for another time so i wasnt surprised or anything but i swear he should have simply held his hands up from the getgo and said im sorry for the offence i have caused i accept the backlash and the oscar committees subsequent decision its not that hard kevin
1668	1	i never said it was exclusively a race problem but when a marginalized  group of people almost exclusively occupy the lower financial and socioeconomic end of the spectrum it makes it 10x times hard to catch up with other races  im black and i have had and continue to have a lot of educatiobalvand enrichment opertinuties well good for you so have i i have 2 bachelors degrees and my masters along with published research after all that im still not valued as high as someone who is white with just a high school diploma youre missing the problemit doesnt matter if you have the highest degree in the world black women with higher degrees still make half what white women make with high school diplomas around 17 lesshttpswwwbloombergcomnewsarticles20180807blackwomenstopjobspayhalfwhatwhitewomensdo it doesnt matter that were over qualified it doesnt matter that we got out the ghetto and that we got great educations were still valvued less it doesnt matter that black women hold more degrees we would still have to work an additional 8 months out of the year to make what one white woman makes per year httpschicagocrusadercomevenwithadvanceddegreesblackwomenearnless  it doesnt matter that your educated and privileged it doesnt matter that you worked hard whether you want to believe it or not  you still on average are making less that a white women whos less qualified and you can pretend not to come to terms with it or not but its a fact
1669	1	yup or cousin or daughterwhen it is not even that youre that ugly but everyone else beautiful
1670	1	gthaving an external reason to shrug off the brainwashing that comes from growing up in a sick society im an outsider this is good because my view is much broaderthis is fucking brilliantwhole post really but this is my favorite part
1671	1	its okay to evaluate comedy and advance the art form if youre a jokester advance the craft but dont deny that jokes veil feelings obvious racism and other isms is on display in real time choosing to use the narrative of racists and other ists even under the guise of joking or title of comedian should be sideeyed at the least and irreversibly squashed at the mostbut i mean you keep championing theyre just laughing at the joke tweet out all the jokes racists will meme go wild with the rape jokes cause humor reddit the mess out of your jokesnotopinions because if youre truly hoping to rid society of the pc culture keep doing you in due time when the world has changed because it kinda does that youll be one of those old racistsists people will continually confront and work to make sure inevitably dies out
1672	1	what happened
1673	1	i sat here for about 10 minutes thinking this one over why do we move where we move im going to ask that during christmas
1674	1	this is incredibly dismissive of darkskinned women is lived experiences
1675	1	but getting a piece of jewelry for your wife or buying a car is not a sign of greed i think thats your issue jesus still lived like a regular person it doesnt mean they idolize money and wealth i think youre being too judgmental here the pastor of my church places god as his utmost priority but still has valuable possessions you should look more at what the pastor is doing for his community and congregation than just physical materials how are you helping anyone by being judgy wudgy either if a middle class mom can have jewelry or a car it should be okay for a pastor
1676	1	this is a question for rsocialjustice101 it is not about this being an opinion this language is damaging and offensive edit your uncle is experiences are not yours to exploit or an excuse for your insensitivity

1681	1	im gonna be honest with you here you did insult him though you can express what he did that was shitty to you without name calling name calling is disrespectful and does nothing to solve the problem or add to the conversationyoure not the only one at fault here he is wrong for giving you the silent treatment for 4 days its okay to take some space but you eventually need to talk things out and understand each other tbh i think both of you are wrong and acting immaturearguments should be you and him as a team against the problem not you against him
1682	1	the new crop of politicians coming in soon will be interesting because they will be the first to have a complete digital history as long as their life span there is no way there is not something problematic with a social media presence going back that long

1686	1	gtand that is the problem im sorry but not sorry you say youre not ignorant of who their are but their behavior still inspires your examination of black behaviorif that is a problem idk how you expect others to learn about both sides i want to learn about us but i damm sure need to know what they are doing because they are soliciting in my area on watered feminism power i have no choice but to ask to make sure we are not being overran than we already are gtyou should spend some time looking them up then they explain why there is nothing for us to even be inspired by in their movements i will but until then i might as well ask some questions pertaining to us im not focused on that right now the world is crazy and im trying to make it i dont have the luxury to buy and promote with the pressure i have already gtyou made a literal comparison hereit can be viewed as a comparison i cant help that intentionally wrote it as of what i seen with my eyes now i will say i apologize to you and any other who thought i just came here to compare but that wasnt my intention and i admit i should have wrote that a bit better speaking of comparison i would encourage anyone to compare and to conduct their own studies and opinions to help locate real information you have to start off somewhere that is the first thing you learn in school to compare gtwe have people inspiredfill someone with the urge or ability to do or feel something especially to do something creativeim pretty sure none of them felt inspired but the opposite i am aware of everything else you mentioned i felt inspired to question men being involved i didnt feel inspired to speak about question black feminism
1687	1	historians like nell painter introduced this issue but no one wanted to hear it

1692	1	omg lol
1693	1	right the show has so many action characters and the like i would have loved for her to decide not to date robert and instead make her an extra in the show like she moves to woodcrest there are so many scenarios you could write with that premise alone having her blow shit up in the background or just casually walking her wolves through the neighborhood or something would be great
1694	1	the mitm song is so hard not to sing when it comes on what are some of the others you wouldve chosen
1695	1	south central compton inglewood watts those brothers dont date sisters
1696	1	youre doing a lot of work to make excuses for black men is choices both as leaders and individualswhen men get power and resources they tend to invest in themselves which i believe is one of the main reasons theyve left churches as followers a space they still dominate as leaders women do more to invest in community and people around them that is why you see women starting and active in organizations and sharing on social media and men being quietyou want black women to try to make up for that but black men need to step up and black women making excuses for them isnt helpingampx200b
1697	1	so black people cant have open discussions about problems within the community because white people might laugh at it lmao thats pathetic even online some of yall cant help but prioritize the white gaze
1698	1	yeah ive never seen a black family play cowboys and indians let alone a party themed as such
1699	1	i wouldnt say it is bad it is just that there are precious few black people that is highly subjective to your zipcode though too zipcode matters a ton there are definite pockets where you can walk outside and see a black person who is not a blood relative more than once in a blue moon i would go full summer breaks as a kid without seeing another black person  you might be in one of those pocketsla and oc dont seem super diverse to me compared to san diego san francisco is much more diverse than all the other areas of california ive lived in ive only ever lived along the coastline  beach volleyball amp triathlon  i went to rio de janiero and that blew my mind with diversity
1700	1	good to know that makes the decision making process much easier
1701	1	i love cyberpunk and ive been looking into urban fantasy a bit recently  anything you recommend

1704	1	i just wanted to add a correction herpes isnt an illness it is a virus except for certain locations and when you get it for example at birth or in the eyes it doesnt hurt or diminish one is lifespan
1705	1	i understand believe me and i appreciate that the burden of resentment that youre expressing here is more about your own selfinterest and selfcare compared to the tone of the op which seemed to be rooted in guilt at not being a good member of the poc brigadei would refer to the association of black psychologists or other professional organization eg  for lcsws and get some referals from there  of course a therapist being black doesnt mean theyll be good fit you should interview them just as you would anyone else there are tons of resources out there on questions and techniques to useyou need to be able to trust your therapist and not have that baggage interfering with that trust  the korean women very well might be a good friendly acquaintance or a good dermatologist or a good chiropractor but not a therapist to you given her people is pattern of disrespect and exploitation and your very valid concern  youre not paranoid statiscally speaking she more than likely does have people in her social or family circle who fit this pattern no need for you to feel for guilty for that channel the resentment into the productive action that will yield the best outcome for you as a selfinterested human being who deserves to have a therapist you trust you owe that to yourself you dont owe anything to anyone else on the basis of them being a good person or a person of color
1706	1	sanders says hes not going to run unless there are no other viable candidates i think that the democratic party may end up like the republicans last presidential cycle with wayyyy too many candidates but i doubt sanders will end up running to be honest hes been pretty good about supporting other people and trying to find the best fit instead of trying to be the best fit
1707	1	that man was a poet lowkey
1708	1	why he aint get enough vote the last time then

1712	1	i only visited the cities so no dating opportunities   i did see some ir couples when out and about i did get hit up in clubs the flirting was the same  talking about things in common  no one said anything about stereotypes or fetishes about bwi lived in the countryside where 30 year old female coworkers werent allowed to live alone  so very retro  there was someone i knew and was interested in me there but he was an oldest son and we lived in a provincial area and we worked together all strikes against anything happening
1713	1	those are nice i especially love the combat boots

1718	1	i have never found kh even the slightest amount of amusing his jokes are corny as well as his movies  from all of his latest scandals he appears to be a homophobic racist womanizing piece of trash
1719	1	quincy jones explicitly said this is why successful men of his generation date white women

1724	1	im not saying an abuser is going to broadcast it im saying there are some obvious warning signs to look to before being in i married this guy but dont trust him to bathe our daughter territory or my husband is masturbating in my baby is mouth territory like you dont just go from nothing to masturbating in a baby is mouth i wouldnt marry any person that i wouldnt feel comfortable with bathing our childi know there definitely are some abusers who hide it well but there are many who dont and people just miss or choose to ignore the red flags my cousin was molested and raped by her stepfather when we were growing up and that man checked off every fucking red flag there is some i remember specificallyignoring physical boundaries  checkwanting to be alone with the girls  checkmaking inappropriate comments  checkinsisting on physical contact with us kids  checki actively avoided him as a child because he made me so uncomfortable but i couldnt explain why my mom picked up on it and stopped sending my sister and i to our aunt is house thanks mom then it came out that he was abusing her and it all made sensehe is not the only man that ive encountered and then learned after that they were an abuser but i picked up on some kind of warning about all of the ones so far that i know of the key being that i know of because i know like you said some are really good at hiding it
1725	1	thank you it was truly an interesting drink lol are you celebrating
1726	1	youre wrong though youre taking behavior men of all races engage in and demonizing it only in black men men in general treat women in general like crap that is the society we live in dating nonblack men doesnt mean being treated substantially better
1727	1	aww no worries it happens to the best of us
1728	1	i completely agree
1729	1	hello i couldnt have said it better myself
1730	1	hi there i appreciate you sharing that tidbit about your dad and his financial obligations as a pastor before now i have never taken the time to connect the dots between churches and income that is because in my mind it always seemed as though questioning church was offlimitshow does your dad reassure his church is worshippers when things of this nature come out in the news
1731	1	ive seen this a lot black woman shares experience and how it makes her feel black man shows up dismisses it and puts her down and then you get angry again when she says she wishes black men were allies youre showing up exactly as you shouldnt be with these remarks seeking to understand what its like for black women is good putting down black women just because you feel defensive is bad
1732	1	gtmost of the amerindian peoples who eventually settled in the caribbean came from south america and travelled through the orinoco river do you have sources or connect to that black americans are truly lost and a lot dont even realize the mixture of nations we have some of us arent even africans but pure natives or have pure carib pure american native genocide wasnt too complete bc it survived through the africans that was brought here they live in majority of us now if not all gtorinoco riverdid the caribbeans travel through that
1733	1	one of the mods over there
1734	1	i think if you still miss your ex after a year then something is seriously wrong you should consider seeing someone about it
1735	1	cliffsinsecure is audience is 62 whitea minstrel show is entertainment that mocks black people there were some black performers who performed minstrel shows under the direction of white people to her that is what insecure is it is an example of modernday minstrelsyyou have these foreign blacks fuckin yvonne orji is nigerianass fuckin issa rae who is half senegalese she is a fuckin halfrican you have these people who are dressing up in a fuckin caricature of what they think black american culture is and their putting on this show of black americanness ooh girl ooh chile this lit bippity boppity boo blam blam it is all for white people you cannot tell me this isnt a minstrelsy showthe dialogue is forced and stilted why do you think white people like this shit so much anything white people like this much is a bad thing if theyre not being made uncomfortable and they arent challenged then it is a bad thing anything that is mainstream is bland and suspectshe reads many comments from a followers who agree with her or stopped liking the show after her criticism just because insecure is popular on social media doesnt mean people are really watching it social media amplifies insecure is audience they make fun of slavery on the show and rape they use the word nigga in a weird way she uses dacs a lot which means descendents of american chattle slavery something about crabs in a barrel african people dont care about black americans why do they feel the need to pretend to be black americans why dont they tell their own story about being african then she goes on a long rant about cynthia erivo calls her a bitch several times being obsessed with americans and wanting to play serena williams in a movie  that is as far as i could stomach
1736	1	im not assuming her intention im making observations she entered into a space not meant for her asking a question that she already had an idea of the answer to if she wanted to correct her ignorance she could do it by googling but ok
1737	1	i came here to specifically say this
1738	1	yeah no one thinks of these things and some people are gonna complain regardless i got nothing against small churches and totally understand anyone that grew up in a small church where you literally know everyone not feeling comfortable in a large one where you may only know a few people to each his own me being introverted being able to slip in and out on sunday and not talk to a million people works for me and i give because those lights aint free im coming to get my word i can give back in return so the church can function and provide services to the community i didnt grow up in church and the megachurch i go to now i found out about after driving by a billboard i was baptized like 5 months later so in that case the marketing that some say church is shouldnt spend money on worked i love my church but im not married to it it is not perfect the pastor isnt perfect could it tighten up and function off less im sure it could and id have a problem with that if i didnt see and participate in all the ways the church gives to the community ive worked some long 12hour august saturdays giving away backpacks food and free health screenings in the the poor part of town each year but if anytime i see something changing that i dont feel comfortable with ill dip
1739	1	you summed up my thoughts perfectly as an aside i hope to be able to explain myself as eloquently as you one day im going to make sure i spend time at the writing lab on campus next semester
1740	1	yeah i briefly wondered if this was a troll based on the onslaught of complaining about black men posts today  i havent necessarily abandoned that thought
1741	1	im in canadaill seen if i can order it from that site thanks
1742	1	essentially but there is a bit more than thati identified 23 types of men who are into me  he fit into one of those types he was in the cycling type  once i knew what to look for i could pick them out of a crowd more cycling swimming and weightlifting exposed me to a greater number of men who are into me runners arent into me so i scaled back a bit on that
1743	1	the entire program is on my laptop equations tables graphs code everything the presentation was an update for the team i no longer work with so more than just the program i just dont get why my manager allowed him to take credit for that specific part like wtf
1744	1	glass ive never heard of glass piercings before im so intrigued
1745	1	best of luck to you as well and i hope you find clarity around your purpose and next steps
1746	1	oh i get what you mean it is not just marginalized folk though a vegan diet is not sustainable or even economic for most people despite what vegans will tell you however it is even worse for marginalized folk because they really cant be picky about what they eat or afford to experiment you would also have to eat more food to get the proper nutrition and calories you need since the healthiest vegan food is not very calorie dense  vegan products as far as i know from my experience tend to be more overpriced than their non vegan counterparts besides almond milk and even then regular milk is slightly cheaper  talking down on them is off base also foreign or indigenous dishes may be more or less vegan than outside dishes and it is a part of their culture that should be respected even ellen a rich white woman had trouble keeping up with the lifestyle even though she would have the best access to the best vegan resources so that says a lot
1747	1	sjw whinerspeople who see race in everything
1748	1	so i know that being somewhat consistent is common but im just going to through in whatever i like and see what happens im huge into art i was an art major before computer science and i want to talk about different aspects of art while also chronicling my art journey ive been intimidated by other mediums but i just want to give everything a tryi also want to make vids about virtual reality and computer related stuff in general google has these really cool diy kits where you build a system that has a smart camera that can recognize objects one girl on yt had one and it not only picked up that she was holding a cat but got the type of cat correct tooi also want to have a list of random shit ive always wanted to try but havent anything from making some time intensive dessert  trying modeling writing a book or even designing a phone game i want to just put myself out there and see what im good at and what makes me happy i cant know until i explore everything that i can
1749	1	it is very difficult to do such a thing the best bet is to probably try and start buying from black farmers and black businesses however we have to make those things financially viable for people which is hard there needs to be black vegans who help out other black peoplea lot of these things come back to how we should support blackowned things
1750	1	i think those things definitely help it is probably a lot easier to get an art degree when youre not concerned about money because it is a tough field to try to make it i do think school can be a great place to make connections though even if you dont come from an affluent background there are some artartrelated degrees that can turn out to be lucrative like medical illustration ux design or art therapy at least where i live but they dont seem like popular choices it took me a whole impractical degree to realize this but i think it is really good to be strategic about what we study in school and how we approach our university experience especially if were interested in a career that is hard to get into
1751	1	thanks for the clarification so latino is like a blanket term that can be more specified like afrolatino or whitelatino i just read his twitter a bit and he said his dads mexican seems as though his mom might be as well
1752	1	how do you quantify things im not sure how you calculate or obtain those kinds of numbers
1753	1	i really enjoyed spiderverse the little things like miles not knowing all the words to the song delighted me
1754	1	hate you
1755	1	an ebony
1756	1	thank you
1757	1	no i am i want to get somewhere serious im just not sure how to navigate that but being myself is sound advice although a big challenge
1758	1	yeah but if it doesnt work youre going to wind up in a patoff with an old lady and ive watched enough sketch comedy to know someone is going to get hurt
1759	1	that is fucked up maybe it is a similar story in every country this is why dv should be taken serioisly
1760	1	none of this is new  callers have been doing this shit for eons
1761	1	i would start by sayin then g the minimum to him  he is riding on your coattails and just going to exhaust you  dont want to be the angry black woman  he will win just by sympathy  forget documenting and reporting him to hr too  just ignore him and continue to be the best
1762	1	gt those are two examples of distortions in the post 1 is overgeneralization and 2blaming youre right that we shouldnt do thatthat is the irony of the whole thing her post is doing everything she is pointing out and worse edit i wont even talk about the fact that she happily lumped this sub in with lipstick alleygthas anyone actually gone and charted the number of positive vs negative post on here i think it would be some interesting data to look ati dont think wed ever decide on a standard lol edit i also think the negativepositive binary is entirely too simplistic to reflect the way black people process and address our problems i think that is part of the problem behind ops perspective
1763	1	oh ok
1764	1	please do it was such a treat
1765	1	no i live in a college town and ive been to bars but theyre not really my scene
1766	1	its not about him talking about me being black it was more of him mentioning the stigma that black girls are thick even tho im thin and how he prefers thicker black girls like what is the purpose of saying that to me
1767	1	ah okay i thought theyve been playing the new edition story everyday afaik
1768	1	so yay weve got one fancyroyal black lady nowthats literally the entire sentiment in a nutshell does it make a difference not really but its still compelling because there arent many examples of women like her in the 21st centuryi think its less about the glorification of white man saving us and more about us being able to see ourselves in that role for oncei wouldve been equally as happy if she married a rich ass black prince whos mother was one of the most famous people in history and had an elaborate highly publicized wedding  sis had to work with the prince she got there arent a ton out there
1769	1	thissssss
1770	1	why dont you see yourself as black
1771	1	gtoh she wasnt jealous but she was delusional im was lowkey popping but i seriously hated myself back then
1772	1	gtif my hard work is just being credited to affirmative actionthat is what im sayingi feel like they look at us in successful positions just because of affirmative action now
1773	1	i disagree i try to incorporate it in everything from surgical knots tenting to teaching math to kids braiding is such an intangible part of black cultural history and a useful practical skill for all black people  including men and i quickly suggest some classes
1774	1	i think he has the court of public opinion confused with personal relationships he is probably used to the people in his life putting up with his mess and doesnt understand that people outside his bubble wont do that
1775	1	we love and support our black men over here
1776	1	where did i say not to take risks where did i say i assume that black women cant do anything
1777	1	i deadass second this lol
1778	1	the caucasity of that statement
1779	1	this is brilliant
1780	1	yea and then when that caused a little backlash he said it was nothing wrong with that either
1781	1	i dont think theres anything wrong with asking a friend to accompany you as you meet up with a person you dont know that well
1782	1	i didnt know that  i may have to reconsider the name then
1783	1	not that i know of as of yet hopefully soon
1784	1	issa is a black american if youre not going to count her as one because she has one african parent then you have to do the same with every black american celebrity with a non black parent as well
1785	1	aww im sorry lol youre sweet thank you so much
1786	1	thanks
1787	1	thank you for your excellent and honest post please ignore the downvotes you are speaking the truths
1788	1	me too  i live in the sf area now it is the most diverse place ive lived   most of my life was very much like the sitcom blackish or fresh prince of bel air
1789	1	black women are doing majority of the work because theres less men involved statistically the living is women then men that is an issue right there the huge issue is the men that we have children by youre telling me 100s or black men who are aware are responsible of 1000s of men doing for being ignorant
1790	1	seriously i felt like it with this veil lol thanks
1791	1	thanks for the recommendation ill try to watch some tonight
1792	1	girl are you ok
1793	1	thats great if you dont care but i do care because it affects my reality the jobs i can get how much i get paid the places i can live how i am treated by medical professionals my overall stress levels and the level of bullshit i deal with daily and who legit doesnt care so you go to the doctor with your mother and overhear a nurse calling her a nr you dont care right edit and it is pretty goofy to me that there are legit people downvoting like they truly have no care about what nonblack people think ok so when you dont get hired for that job because the owner is prejudiced dont you dare open your mouth to complain after all you dont care what nonblack people think which means you dont care how the words stereotypes prejudices and actions of nonblack people result in systematic discrimination against you gtfo with that
1794	1	oh ok hang in there
1795	1	gt what trolls thoughtroll is probably not the correct term for the type of person im talking about shes not trying to screen out those general type of internet trolls who just go around saying offensive things for shock value shes screening out the type people who come into the forum with the goal of spreading the belief that colorism isnt a problem and that focusing on it is a waste of time and energy chrissie has been fighting those type of people in the comments section of her youtube channel for years she knows how that type of thing can derail the focus of a discussion so she is preventing that altogether by screening them out youre right that the same thing can be accomplished by just having more moderators but isnt it  much more effective to just stamp out the problem before it starts kind of like how its more effective to reduce crime in a community by putting more resources toward education and employment with the goal of preventing crime in the first place than it is to just send in the police to arrest everyonegtdark skinned women all dont think the same way i hope you dont think that no they dont all think the same but they do have a lot in common the goal here is not to create an echochamber its to create a space where people who are similar and face adversity as a result of the attribute they have in common kind of like your fave subs rblackladies and rblackfellas gtwhat she is doing is basically a form of reverse colorism and the creation of hbcus the naacp and any other black only spacesorganizations are reverse racism so what im sorry but this doesnt bother me gtshe is being way too radical people said the same thing about mlk so again this doesnt bother me if anything it means that chrissies headed in the right direction gtyou dont run and hide in real lifeare people who attend hbcus and join organizations for black professionals running and hiding
1796	1	not saying that this is how it should be but men typically love women that cook just because of momma recipes history knowledge etc all that comes from the momma so it is not a shocker me anyway that a man expects a woman to cook just because that is how they did it originally at home africa if we go further back in history what most people dont know is that the tribes didnt have that gender inequality ish going on women hunted and men they both cooked  but that tiny knowledge has been ripped because of you know what the only one to gain that type of access and knowledge is threw a woman in the 1900s women stayed home while men went to work i hear that sentence all the time what i dont hear is the thanks you is that they contributed back then  my grandmother told me  women had women gatherings teaching their babies spoiled etc back then only the abusive black men followed the traits of white men the mindset of a healthy black men then was why does my lady need to work if i work instead i can spoil her with flowers jewelry money this mentality is damn near extinct the cleaning children and cooking was tasks a lot of women wanted to do not expected especially the women who was being spoiled with a man whose trying to provide what makes today different is that broke mentallyemotionally sick men are expecting these tasks and developed half the mind of a nigga and white man to proceed to intentionally strip down a black woman that is what is common so youre speaking what i know already that group of black men from 1800s1900s is less of them now in the 21st century the only sexism i see is those who demand or against not expect
1797	1	that is got me excited too i think im going to take my nephews with me i read a review that said it is the first animated movie in a while to try to do something different
1798	1	i was raised in south central compton and inglewood my 5 brothers rarely dated black women now that were all adults ive relocated to the pnw my brothers still live in los angeles county none of them date black women so id have to agree with  urocksteadyrudie
1799	1	i dont think that banning hate is progressive its important that you mod according to those specifications to ensure a space that feels safe to expression i meant no disrespect
1800	1	why dont you and 6ix9ine go discuss the state of hip hop i mean that is your king right you do follow him he is the lyrical genius that was able to rhyme keke fefe and free free
1801	1	dont focus on the downvotes plus i could have done a way better job of making my pointthe real concern is how people engage culture traditions styles and the like it is troubling how today we get fingered for being uncouth but tomorrow it is the trendy thing being pushed by someone who doesnt look like you me and the rest of the team that is bogusbut if someone is appreciative and respects these sorts of things then cool you can tell the difference they dont give you mushy answers or hit you with well actually
1802	1	i dont think you have to go searching for them like that i think calling out men in your life who are acting badly or intervening when you see a woman being mistreated by a man in public is enough im sure youve been around men that made misogynistic comments or mistreated women before calling out that bad behavior when you see it is important
1803	1	again youre romanticizing women in those days didnt have equal rights to men they could not leave they were more house slaves than anything
1804	1	congrats it is hard to wait so long isnt it im optimistic that it is going to happen someday it is just maybe going to have to happen in someone else is uterus and im not quite ready for that yet

1806	1	i hope so these people are pissing me off and i dont want to see 80 of them again
1807	1	buying for the school districtincreasing demand for homes in good school districts is part of what depresses home values in black neighborhoods and prevents us from generating wealth i read an article recommending that black people abandon their neighborhoods for this reason i wonder if i can find it good discussion material edit havent going that article yet but here is one in what im talking about httpswwwbrookingseduresearchdevaluationofassetsinblackneighborhoods
1808	1	im not super into politics so correct me if im wrong but didnt he not get in because the rest of the democrats basically did him dirty and backed hilary
1809	1	sorry i should have stated there is no problem dating outside your race love is love but i just cant stand when some black women saying i will only date white men so proudly at least keep that to  yourself stop embarrassing us black people we look so desperate because of these people proclaiming their love for other races  it is disgusting honestly this selfhate is so bad
1810	1	wouldnt this be a subject of family i mentioned all of us and role in this chaos
1811	1	we automatically ban people who post in problematic white subs some are overtly racist some more subtle the second a user makes a post in say the_donald they are automatically banned and cannot vote here even if they are subscribedin addition we screen all comments for problematic white appology bs and are quick with the ban hammer on those cases
1812	1	with censure female friends yes most times if theyre male though the wait staff is usually nice i never even thought about it that much until you just mentioned itedit swiftkey keyboard on crack ive never typed censure no idea why it would change female to that
1813	1	yes and some of the comments call it out
1814	1	if theyre going around saying theyre not considered black then obviously people are saying theyre not black you cant tell me no one questions the blackness of people like that you cant have it both ways and say nobody is saying theyre not black
1815	1	either these are white people in disguise or theres some real coonery at work

1822	1	i dont know can we say the same for adults who dont have the capacity of adults if it is a yes how can we protect them but keep everyone safe at the same time
1823	1	i yi yi you let black men disrespect you and decided the solution was to stop dating them all together rather than curving the trash ones unfortunately for you men as a group are problematic nonblack men arent any safer and if your only solution to the root issue of having weak boundaries is to date another race youre still going to get screwed over
1824	1	im not sure why this matters but no we went our separate ways after high school i went to college and found that the black guys that were there almost exclusively date white or asian girls i have a different white boyfriend that ive been with for almost a year and if things continue the way they are we will get married and have no babiesedit spelling
1825	1	my post has not been well received at al and ive realized that i havent worded it correctly when i was saying everyone was anti black i was referring to implicit biasesdoes it bother you on any level that your partner might hold negative implicit biases towards your race and if so how do you get thru itsometimes these messages are unavoidable we are confronted with them every time we turn in the tv walk thru the magazine isle etc they are so pervasive that black children have already internalized them and weve all seen the studies where they associate whiteness with superiority heres some info about implicit biaseshttpkirwaninstituteosueduresearchunderstandingimplicitbiasimplicit biases are pervasive  everyone possesses them even people with avowed commitments to impartiality such as judgesimplicit and explicit biases are related but distinct mental constructs  they are not mutually exclusive and may even reinforce each otherthe implicit associations we hold do not necessarily align with our declared beliefs or even reflect stances we would explicitly endorsewe generally tend to hold implicit biases that favor our own ingroup though research has shown that we can still hold implicit biases against our ingroupimplicit biases are malleable  our brains are incredibly complex and the implicit associations that we have formed can be gradually unlearned through a variety of debiasing techniques
1826	1	agreed
1827	1	i feel like the lyrics themselves were explicit and that shouldve been a sign cardi never marketed herself as for the kids
1828	1	hey congrats on working towards med school it is something ive been thinking about as wellhonestly i find online dating makes the romantic side of my social life easier because of the clear roles thing if were talking it is because were interested in each other  there is no wondering or having to have an awkward conversation about it that being said im going to start group therapy in the new year and try doing more structured group activities ive spent a lot of time avoiding things in order to protect myself but i realize that behaviour is harming me
1829	1	whew speak on it
1830	1	i am super glad my dad doesnt do this it would be weird and im someone where if you touch me out of the blue i jump clean out of my skin
1831	1	thats good to hear im usually not a fan of threads like this black women are queens and shouldnt be tied down to a group of men youre still young only 28 you have plenty of time to find a husband
1832	1	thank you
1833	1	i teared up reading this
1834	1	i do believe my cousin because she has shown me pictures of her and her friend with the guy out for dinner and is very much talkative and open about him in a such a way that it doesnt at all seem like she is trying to hide something all 3 are in a group chat and they only go out with him when theyre both available to go but i do recognize that is not normal hence me posting here to get more information and advice on this lifestyle so i appreciate all that you are telling me it does sound like i want a boyfriend and i think later down the road i most definitely do but at this point in my life i want something half way more like a business transaction i want to get something out of what im giving and i want it to be a mutually beneficial relationship and this seems like the closest thing i could get to that but it also sounds too good to be true if i do pursue this route im definitely going to proceed with extreme caution i dont want nice things from them i want to do fun things with them like going to a jazz club but i hear what youre saying and i am taking this all in and it is helpin me question what it is im looking for so thank you for your responses
1835	1	i liked htgawm more for conner and oliver actually  i started liking alfred because of tumblr and lipstickalley lolol

1846	1	this the world is still your oyster as an undergrad your performance will lead you to any law school you want to go to which typically should be t14 for greatest impact and value
1847	1	there is something pathological about it like when an alcoholic blames everyone else for their problems rather than looking inwards
1848	1	yes
1849	1	you mean like pairs
1850	1	so you arent attracted to black men because theyre black if race wasnt an issue for you why do you keep rejecting the black men hitting on you but have a problem with black men attracted to you because youre light skin
1851	1	yah  i can show you where to get them if you want
1852	1	id try the curling sponge httpsyoutubepqo8w4naodo my mom has a short 4b4c fro and it works for her my hair is too long to try ithow are you using the gel typically you have to do finger twists with it to define the curls
1853	1	i thought that this was a safe space for black women too really disappointed in some of the responses i got under this post but its all good i love my boyfriend dearly and i have never ever looked at his friend in that way why anyone would assume that  because of this discussion is mind boggling to me
1854	1	i think about this a lot actually for me i think it was the combination of several  things a modern day fairytale scenario that weve all been pitched since childhood who marries into royalty anymorehow many films have had this same plot  the obsession the public has with princess diana since the nineties we had to get the full circle story to see who her adult son marriedthe fact that mm was an atypical choice of spouse for british royalty older  americanpreviously married not royalty and black the fact that a black woman is officially a member of the british monarchy and that has pissed off so many racists also maybe im secretly obsessed with the amount of power that this previously marginalized woman now has white people have to vacate the floor of a building if shes present there thats thrilling to me finally money she got super rich really quick she secured the bag of all bags
1855	1	gtwhat is with the self hating people here recentlythese types of posts have been a thing for a while now because reddit is the way that it is i think it is much more likely to attract black people who have self hate issues
1856	1	its time to stop giving the benefit of the doubt i used to do the same until i got fed up now i dont deal with extraneous bs
1857	1	gthowever it doesnt mean hes not helping other members of his church or the people in his community it actually does at a certain level especially at the level he is spending we make choices and he chose to invest his money in an exotic car instead of helping someone or practicing good stewardship it was his choice but it was a poor decision for a pastor he chose a service job there is a reason the bible says that not many of you should presume to be teachers they are and should be held to a different and higher standard than the average person ampx200bgtbut what theyre asking is whats the arbitrary amount before they look bad 1000 2000 theyre simply playing devils advocate jesus never said riches were bad or that pastora should never have valuable possessions as a christian you should keep that in mind like i said though the line might not be precise but it is well under a 200k car  it might make you more comfortable to think people criticizing him are just playing devil is advocate but some of us are making criticisms because we care more about the church and its effectiveness than defending a man who makes silly financial and poor leadership decisions it sounds though like you should read up on jesus teachings on riches probably starting with mark 10 he gave entirely too many warnings about them to brush this extreme situation off as some arbitrary critique over a couple thousand dollars
1858	1	gtwhy are people still pretending to themselves sugar daddies arent simply sexual predators like weinstein or crosby every single one of themampx200bi feel like the quality of men that fund these arrangements is a topic that doesnt get discussed enough there seems to be this perception that there is this healthy supply of older decent well paid emotionally stable men who just happen to want to play the sugar daddy role the amount and kind of safety precautions sex workers have to take should be a heads up from the beginning
1859	1	or they believe they can bind everyone together lmaofolks sick thinking a mix baby will cease racism there is just stupid reasons folks get in these relationships
1860	1	exactly
1861	1	hopefully theyll have an online subscription service because if you gotta get cable to get cleo tv it is not gonna last
1862	1	gtold asian ladies this is facts i either get over the top compliments from them or that intense disapproval theres no in between
1863	1	no the term isnt used in day to day swahili in tanzania or kenya at all it is just fake swahili i think that is why at least here in tanzania from what i know people dont seem offended by it or concerned i see the points of disney claiming ownership but i am not concerned because it is not like the phrase is used day to day at allin fact i have never ever ever heard a tanzanian person say it seriously
1864	1	i dont know i dont think dating predators has much to do with the hood in any form she just sounds more like she has issues with how she relates to men considering her father is issues it is not too surprising
1865	1	exactly lol i was the only one at the time that said no so her argument could be the majority of black people dont see a problem with that either way im sure she will get the hairstyle because she can do whatever she wants of course i just dont approve
1866	1	right i almost dont care that she doesnt write her own songs thats just good sense to me to have a team do it maybe in the 90s it was a thing when most upcoming rappers couldnt afford a team lol
1867	1	exactly and we deadass had a thread recently where some were saying they hate when black men call them queen but suddenly they have no problem with his nonblack dude calling them my black queen smhim sorry but some of the users here are too transparent
1868	1	yes trolls was a major reason she stated
1869	1	wow i remember reading that they were estranged but not why they were no longer on speaking terms another fun fact rebecca walker and meshell ndegeocello have a child together
1870	1	gtim not even trying to guess his intentions im evaluating his decisions as a christian leaderand therefore you are guessing his intentions by doing that even inadvertently your previous comment shows that youre worried that he is not giving back to his congregation or to the needy but you dont know that for sure his purchase is wrong because it is wrong not necessarily because of how many people in his church are eating gt stop nobody is judging pastors with iphones theyre judging pastors who live or want to live like theyre rappers and sports stars also did any of these poor people make a vow to god to lead lol yet people support those very rappers and sports stars and dont hold them to higher standards since theyre public figures it doesnt matter if those poor people made a vow to god to lead i am a christian too show me a bible verse where jesus said pastors must disavow material possessions he only talked about greed however having valuable possessions does not equal greed that is my point youre not the only one capable of buying things that you can afford or saving money pastors can do the same thingampx200bgt youre completely mischaratarizing criticisms and im starting to think it is because you know this is wrong nobody is asking him his marriage or the church to be perfect theyre asking him and the church to at least try to live up to the teachings of the man they claim to follow im not i see many nonbelievers and even one believer here that believe this i agree that this is wrong but youre being hyper judgmental of all pastors that have material posessions and that is what i dont like  if you dont know how much they paid for something or whether or not they are making sound financial decisions then you shouldnt be concerned it is not wrong to have material posessions here and there even a luxury car because yes there are ways to get a mercedes benz without spending the price of a college tuition on it i feel like people of you arent fully aware of the church is teachings either gt i know he is blowing at least 3k a month on an extreme luxury purchase that he could have been doing something else with regardless of his intent i agree and you shouldve focused on that rather than on the needs of his congregation because as afawk no one has come out and said theyre hungry or needy in his congregation it is a good way to play devil is advocate because once we get inside the minds of these pastors we learn how to destroy the problem at its sourceampx200bampx200b
1871	1	oh yeah no hate on them aiming to acquire the bag but im focused on functional strength first and foremost and want inspiration in that department not going to lie and say i dont care what my butt looks like but it is not the only thing i care about  derail
1872	1	ive never worked in the restaurant industry but ive had friends who do one exfriend had the nerve to tell me that maybe black people would be treated better in restaurants if they tipped better that stereotype is truei just asked her do you not think your prejudice and preconceived notions come through your interactions with black guest if you see and treat us negatively why do you think you should be rewardedi cant stand the entitlement to tips some waiters have regardless of service they have given to give half ass service and expect a black person 2030 tip just to prove a stereotype wrong naah
1873	1	i just started listening to the horror of delores roach and im hooked im on episode 3
1874	1	because the problem is disrespect we wash our mouths out with soap and then what there is always something else it is your hair your lips your fashion your gait your weight
1875	1	i do too at least femmes that want to be with other femmes
1876	1	source
1877	1	yeah i had to resist the urge to respond to some serious ignorance here it is definitely a mix though reddit is a cesspool of paternalistic white people but a lot of us are caught up in bootstrap mentalities but also in not letting other black women express frustrations and imposing personal methods for coping with the weight of racism on others
1878	1	gtthats just you and your opinionthis is not an opinion it is literally wrong to blame a whole population of black men you can say half majority or such but to say every single black male is shit is crazy im protecting what is right dont tell me what im protecting without confronting with me on the subject hell i fear women like you are going to say my son aint shit and he is one of the most kindhearted babies ive encountered among plenty others who grew up to be outstanding black men gtplus the posts that were made within the last 24 hours didnt even shit on them they just said they were tired of themdid you really just make that blanket statement i dont screenshot so shall i give you examples from users who hate or discredit every man with pigmented to his skin then you said in the last 24 hours  that is bad gtthey have that right and you cant tone police no onethey have that right dont make them right im not policing no one you can think or say whatever you want im going to do the same and say youre wrong i hope half of you dont have sons you know what i take that back bc im not that type of person i hope all of you have sons and realize how precious they are and what they can be yall word choices descriptions and tone are disrespectful to those who would and will protect you be there for you comfort you im not discrediting experiences im discrediting the stigma of all black men are bad you just showed me what type of person you are by saying im protecting black men  like duh majority i met protect me can i not return the favor seems like youre just protecting one sexgender instead of protecting your race mind you little girls and little boys see these posts imagine what the hell theyre thinking when they see this ish grown ass women telling the world how they feel about them this is pitiful and i love yall and all but im not here for it im not here for it at all we dont watch what we say we dont care what we say we just do and say we dont even acknowledge those who done good and can do we can share experiences every day 247  i have them too but to just categorize all black men like they some cattle are you sure they are the only ones messed up my goodness im triggered
1879	1	that is how i took it
1880	1	we could make a discord server
1881	1	ok well then i misread the her asking you out on the date part my apologies
1882	1	yeah one of my friends came over and hung out for a while and held him while i got some stuff done it made a big difference
1883	1	it is the same ratio as all other diaspora colonial nations in the caribbean the wealthy 1 cubans are white the poor cubans are african you just only see the wealthy ones cause they are the ones who refused to live under communist rule and fled to america all the wealthy jamaicans are white too they just still all live in jamaica so americans never encounter them and are shocked when they hear white people with jamaican accents
1884	1	had less when i wrote that lol
1885	1	gt look put together that is it that is what im trying to do and ive never quite thought about my uniform i will look more into it  i swear if i could give you a gold award i would thank you so much for all this advice about to save it to my notes d
1886	1	the pick mes and race handmaidens really showed up in full force yesterday  on a sub centered around black women they wanna center everyone else and step on eggshells for what maybe they should take their own advice and ignore posts that rub them the wrong way thats what black women get told to do right
1887	1	i might check it outthanks
1888	1	because 1 this isnt an isolated incident and 2 an apology rings pretty hollow when you post that people have made up anger over this its harder to say he owned up to it when he proceeds to do other shit and then gets whiny when called out on itthe fact youre gay is irrelevant to the conversation you dont speak for those that are upset by this and hes not being kicked out in the street hes just not getting one gig and any business has the freedom not to hire anyone on those grounds
1889	1	lord ive been there before sometimes we do embarrassing things for the d
1890	1	i miss it  have fun
1891	1	yea i dont think im up for it either it doesnt sound like a field to dabble in i didnt realize it is essentially a career path that requires research and commitment im just glad i asked questions instead of jumping in head first
1892	1	im not suggesting bottling up the pain or putting on a happy face im talking about challenging your mindset genuine confidence within yourself and belief that with hard work you can do anything you set your mind toi think background definitely makes things tougher but still not impossible and i believe that positive stories and examples for people is even more important for people with difficult backgrounds my belief is that you cannot be what you cannot see my father came from a background just as tough as that he was able to make it out of a toxic family and poverty because he had mentors to show him what was possible now that hes successful he goes back to his community and mentors young men in similar situations many of his mentees have been able to make it out of their situations as well because of his presence as a role model he shows them what is possible and proves that they can do it too because its true they can and they doand please do not dismiss my hard work by saying im gifted intellectually or smart i am not i do well because i work extremely hard to do well in school i am constantly studying reading and writing every day to improve my craft i got my internships because i worked hard to find opportunities for myself and took advantage of all the resources available to me at my college
1893	1	i only made it to st louis and dc this year st louis really doesnt count because i live in kansas city lol next year im hoping at the very least to visit new orleans colorado and somewhere out of the country with beautiful beaches
1894	1	my niece actually pulled a toy garden shovel on her older brother and said dont make me cut chushe was 3 he was like 6 like wtf i should have been a reasonable adult role model and intervened but i fell out laughing
1895	1	you cant be a sugar baby if you have feelings about him being with another women you cant play his game better than him because he has provided you with significant resources and you have provided him with companionship its not an even match i would distance from him if i were you and cut your losses take the value that hes given you and move on im sure you can find someone who can advise you as well as he did drop him
1896	1	never pass up a sale unless youre at old navy therell be another one in 2 hours
1897	1	he has an album coming out in a few days
1898	1	thanks for the info i was doing some research and saw the decline charts with bitcoin i dont think i have the time to strategize which currancies are the best while im an agent do you have recommendations as far as investments or which companies sites apps etc to browse im using yahoo and investing they seem pretty decent for my basic knowledge
1899	1	if he doesnt take you out then he isnt dating it doesnt matter whether he spends anything or not it matters that he is proud to he seen with you that came from my momper dating coaches if youre clubbing ir at a meet market setting avoid the guys who are approaching you closer to last call  they are desperate the ones who approach earlier in the evening may also be after a hookup but they think youre legit attractive  late night they just want a creature with a human vagina and suspect you have one allegedly the opposite is true for women  the later in the evening the hotter the guy has to bemine to give is that if he fails to make an impression it is time to stop meeting him most people dont make an impression on me if he doesnt make one he isnt worth seeing again
1900	1	i believed you the first time
1901	1	i did pineapple water before it was so sweet but i prefer pineapple smoothies instead
1902	1	he did apologize for those comments years ago i dont think kevin actually gives a fuck honestly until someone tried to hurt his pockets in my opinion but if we cant have an honest discussion instead of banning people then whats the point  i understand that many lgbtq people may be offended but if someone hurt you and they apologized years ago are you going to continue bringing it up or are you going to move on if he hasnt changed fine die on that cross but if the person has grown then are we gonna let them grow or condemn them for the rest of their lives we live in the social media era im pretty sure we all have said fucked comments about any race or group but as adults we grow from our mistakes
1903	1	gt men get to be men women get to be women in certain racesthere are a lot of people mostly black men and some black women who dont abide by this so honestly the word is become a big red flag for a lot of people the linked articles in the first one explain a lot of that your post made me ask questions because even though you used male you also used men and capitalized male while only using female and not capitalizing it it sounds like splitting grammatical hairs but it is something a lot of misogynistic black men and women do personally im not a fan of using words that dont specify humanity for any black person man or woman
1904	1	go for it its the easiest piercing ive had to deal with so far
1905	1	he also said it was just made up anger on his instagram and i 100 blame himplus were talking about someone literally unable to make a real apology to take a super high paying gig hell live hes not a victim
1906	1	aint that the truth but i just wish our most common greeting was something else
1907	1	she is starting to see it for sure and she is definitely getting it hilariously her dad asked her last xmas as he was driving back to her mom is house wouldnt it be nice to spend all christmas with me one year and that lil girl said nope cuz then my mom would be sad without me if you wanted to spend all christmas together you should not have broken up the family dad so i need to spend it with both of you we were like dammmmmmmmnnnnnn
1908	1	tom was amazing wasnt he i dont even care about physique but the way the camera panned to his muscles biceps etc they knew what they were doing
1909	1	holy shitthis right here
1910	1	in order to maintain large expensive building and a large congregation you often need expensive equipment like projectors computers etc to preach to the congregation and minister to them especially in this digital age without money a church cannot function i am a member of a small church and the pastor depends on the congregation to pitch in for everything but it is extremely hard not everyone will even pay all the money goes to chairs new instruments computers etc a mega church will have even more bills to pay especially if the place they rent isnt even theirs the expensive branding is merely a consequence of preaching the gospel people like preachers that are recognizable theyre using their advantage to simply being their message out there some pastors are also full time due to the fact that not everyone wants to be a pastor for obvious reasons so they have to choice but to lead a whole congregation by themselves but at the same time they need their daily bread and meat like everyone else the people you see in the media are the worst of the worst examples there are plenty of churches especially big churches that give back to the community but those churches dont get enough attention its actually harder for smaller churches to give back to the community because they dont have that many members and therefore money megachurches are actually better in a way unfortunately there are pastors that abuse the system but that goes against the word of god and other members of the christian community do not stand by them the church is not a monolith theres so much pressure on churches to go the extra mile for their members and their congregation and sometimes the congregation isnt even grateful or if they dont do enough or even too much members or visitors will complain its tough to maintain a church and i feel like the general public doesnt know this they just think pastors go to church on sunday morning preach and rinse and repeat but its much more than that theres nothing wrong with having paid staff and pastors the problem is where their priorities lie
1911	1	yeah i agree shes definitely a victim of the justice system just not in the way people initially thought
1912	1	that looksdifferent lol so its actually real corn but preserved in some sort of way
1913	1	nah im good luv enjoy
1914	1	hmm i expressly wrote that not all black people posess those features and i also point out that i chose those features because theyre the most often shat on again reread my post because i dont wanna argue with you over a strawman its why i asked you to quote me because it seems as if you hurriedly read it and just went over that part in trying to be offended edit also why are you offended that im loving on features that i posses as a black woman i have dark skin nappy hair and big lips i am well within my rights to love and prefer those features as most beautiful im really trying to figure out how you can be that offended by what i wrote unless its that you didnt really read what i wrote or you dont like it when these features are celebrated as a feature of blackness period in the latter case id ask you to really look into why you dont like it when people uplift a certain type of beauty that is under appreciated what we are not gonna do is alllivesmater the beauty standards that oppress black women with specific features associated with blackness
1915	1	definitely worth it imho
1916	1	i was about to post this this is the only place i see nonwhite folks posting nudes and it is free of all the racist foolishness
1917	1	ehh i think it can black panther has culture that is why we relate to it the other movies stuck to the plot and created better fighting scenes for me it was the fighting i was annoyed at and felt that people died too quickly i do however believe there should be more super hero movies dedicated to us bc we lack in that department
1918	1	im in the midatlantic area panjde i imagine there are different flavors of the same thing all around though

1921	1	never even heard of rblackit id like to see it i swear i saw a black feminism sub that was private too but whenever i search i cant find it
1922	1	it is convenient who wants to spend so much of their morning routine on hair or spend an additional hour or more on styling on wash days or if i go to salon spend most of my day there not me also there are plenty of hair textures on the market that resemble black hair i wear wigs that resemble my natural hair just blown out i can dye bleach and straighten it without worrying about damage to my own hairi know im not the only one who does this is it still selfhate
1923	1	you see i love kaiba so i always wanted him to win no matter what lmao i even have a blueeyes white dragon tattoo on my back i got when i went to japan the first time  but yes ishizu is a great role model and i love that she is confident and people respect her dueling abilities and credentials
1924	1	yup blackish is even more popular with white audiences only 20 of its audience is black these stats come from 2017 nielson datahttpswwwnielsencomuseninsightsnews2017forusbyusthemainstreamappealofblackcontenthtml take a look at the chart at the link they have viewership stats for all the popular black shows and only 311 they present have a majority black viewership most people took this data to mean duh authentic black stories do sell and diversity is a win plus television viewership is becoming less segregated overall i think this is the right take on the subject
1925	1	lol i honestly dont really have one i just use a facial scrub and moisturizer ive been looking for some skin care routines online
1926	1	thanks i needed to hear this people and their stupid racial hangups are annoying but i just gotta stay unbothered their bigotry is their loss not mine
1927	1	no one is doing anything to you no one is disrespecting black men i dont understand the sensitivity to the word tired bfellas is a safe space i automatically assume i am respected and appreciated as a black woman in that space if i were to see im tired of black women id be chomping at the bit to read what op had to say that led him to feel that way and would be happy to offer my perspective devoid of feeling offended if you can reread her words and just remember this is a safe space for all black people i feel pretty confident you wont feel so attacked as saying were doing you dirty like someone is trying to embarrass black men on reddit is a bit extreme i dont feel you understand  the context and feelings behind op is post it saddens me that instead of being met with understanding there are many so busy being offended when no disparaging remarks about black men were made beyond op expressing a situation she keeps encountering is exhausting her synonym for tiredwhy not offer your insight into the behavior she experienced rather than getting in your feelings because she didnt express herself the way you feel she should have using the exact pc words that are acceptable to you it is okay to acknowledge it happens and offer your insight im sure many of us would adore hearing and i mean that with all sincerity and zero sarcasm gotta say that cuz it is the internet mofo is pessimistic af online lol best and happy kwanzaa to you edit spelling editing my edit
1928	1	i dont which why i literally said yall can do you doesnt change the fact that whats happening in the space is problematic point me to a post on bfellas that isnt darkmanns objectifying bullshit that 1 specifically says bad things about black women 2 has a lot of upvotes and 3 is supported in the comments you wont find it and saying that this is off one post is also a lie there were at least 34 posts that had bad things to say about black men specifically just yesterday this isnt new from bladiesand since you do police to space im saying this because i hope you consider how shitty it looks when people that are our sisters mothers aunties cousins ect hop on a internet forum hosted by whiteass reddit have their top post be im tired of black men we can literally compare the two spaces and see what would be acceptable black men demonstrated youre not going to come in their space and bad mouth their kinfolk but yall allow that here its not about man v woman its about black man v black woman and in a public space like this its unproductive and just damaging to our community you can try to frame it as venting all you want but at this point youre the space in which this energy is created and distributed white eyes look here and go yep black men aint shit even black women say it
1929	1	gtvcu students rallied behind the art professor i had previously interpreted that as students rallied around the black professor there is a lot of black people that live in richmond

1941	1	theyre not made for nonwhites theyre just a fetish for nonwhites
1942	1	gthey straight up do not do nuance when the topic is race or culturewhite privilege they never have to learn about any cultures other than their own so when theyre confronted with it theyre remedial in their understandingeta should have read urhombus2httpswwwredditcomuserrhombus2 post before i typed what i did lol great minds
1943	1	same so underrated i keep encouraging my friends and family to watch it
1944	1	establishing generational wealth for one family at the expense of hundreds of families if anything this is the worst of the lot
1945	1	dead  this replyhttpstwittercomjoaneecestatus1076261466901303297s20 im gonna use that picture for all the pick mes i encounter from now on
1946	1	exactly
1947	1	oh well with meghan markle and mixed people in general in the us you start to run into the one drop rule this rule states that if you have even one black ancestor then youre black although it is not an actual law any more it is still how a lot of americans perceive blackness ironic considering that it would make a good chunk of white people black
1948	1	i think youre in to something about not going through high school in this environment i head an awful elementary and middle school experience lots of racial bullying and depression and i just started refusing to go to school unless they parents pulled me out in 7th grade i dont think i would have made it out at all if i stayed there in highschool my brother barely did and his self esteem is still in shambles at 30 years old i often wonder how i ended up so relatively well adjusted after the fuckery i went through
1949	1	sending you encouragement today education is a stressful but rewarding profession i hope everything goes well and that you have a blast with your tiny humans
1950	1	my concern is that it is not just a poor financial decision it is a model of his decisions as a leader this is a man who sat down with a racist xenophobic violent president for a seat at the table the way his marriage works this came on the heels of him saying he was too immature for his wife and how a christian life should be lived even if he didnt break a direct biblical command it is enough for me to see him as unfit for the position he has and to question the words that come out of his mouth regardless of how they make people feel
1951	1	i agree 100 i am so tired of only ever seeing dark skinned men with lightskinned women especially when you dont see the reverse of that equation can we please see a dark skinned woman with a dark skinned man how difficult is that
1952	1	there is always something especially when you throw spouses in there last year a close mixed friend of mine had to deal with a bunch of questions about what he really was and how she at least knew he wasnt white from a coworker is wife
1953	1	why wouldnt i have seen them
1954	1	i will thanks
1955	1	people already touched on the private sub issue so i wont rehash that but i do want to say the mods here take steps to prevent white lurkers from effecting discussion too much we cant stop people from subscribing but a significant portion of our subscribers are banned from here  meaning they cant comment or vote on comments unlike other black subs we automatically ban all users who post in problematic white subs which cuts down on the bridging immensely
1956	1	can i come through this screen and slap the taste outta his mouth for you
1957	1	how do we not own hairstyles we invented you sound dumb fuck off back to unpopular opinionsedit you were extra large mad over this comment lolhttpimgurcomrj1kpatedit 2 racist troll with multiple accounts httpimgurcomztcplgfedit 3still going httpimgurcomggeiv9d
1958	1	i understand im so sorry youre in such a tough position
1959	1	i got my license in a compact state  i work for the federal government in tidewater  working in an office or clinic is not high dollar where i live  the money and hardest work is in the hospital setting
1960	1	this right here
1961	1	okay another comment i like i hope you are not internalizing self hate with me gtthere are africans and jamaicans who very much the dominant gender dominate gender or ethnicity dominantmost important powerful or influential you dont have to be powerful and wealthy to be dominate gt men have to be responsiblethat is a broad statement yes majority arent the most respective male but you still have that group that is being overlooked at and i think my is statement is being overlooked in this post i agree with the statistics of black women that is the thing i agree i dont disagree with 98 comments on here i keep getting broad statements of what men are doing when majority cant even vouch for themselves bc theyre either being over ran by the population ignored dead or in prison so the numbers is unknown as to many men are conscious and aware of the issues pertaining to black female populations we are not being ignored by them that is for sure but it is scary that we dont even know an accurate amount of those who is willing to fight with us and keep other men and boys in line
1962	1	taylor swift or her handlers is famous for nuking her social media if politicians do it right theyll be finea lot of people like to play this gotcha game more than they care about the politician is actual beliefs if it is racism they fixate on the slur instead of the policy
1963	1	im latched onto certain kinds because i would have never done that youd take it as if im talking black women in general why are you keep stressing the word responsible when im simply focused on how relationships form in this day of time that increases the chances of meeting broken men they dont just make these personals up and think it works no a lot of men in their 20s and teens are being influenced which may help shape a man personality and perspective on life women and children if men didnt have this type of opportunity who would be around them toxic people are only smart in choosing vulnerable people that is the only thing theyre smart at the minute they find someone who falls off as desperate looking for sex willing to cook clean willing to take out on dates and treat them a certain way etc they are in until they get bored or ths vulnerable realize it too late toxic people are not smart bc a lot use the same tactics shall i show you screenshots of women testimonys or interviews from journalists recording these sorts of problems
1964	1	ok your edit is straight facts i dont see an opinion there
1965	1	unfortunately all of the incourse scholarships that my school offers require you to either be a stem major or require you to have grandparents that have worked at the school for x number of years which is impossible for black people because my school only integrated 50 years ago ive been looking those scholarships up and down for 3 years and that is the bulk of them
1966	1	youre welcome
1967	1	gt i never knew what a little free library was until todayive been trying to start one in my neighborhood but never knew what they were called till today  it is such a dainty little name
1968	1	california perhaps
1969	1	do you do twists with marley hair as well ive been trying to get into braiding my own hair
1970	1	this is my first thought too this isnt about trusting the dad it is about trying to protect her daughter from her own abuse stuff like this isnt always logical
1971	1	what are you talking about
1972	1	even jobs with great healthcare coverage come with huge additional costs to the employee  premiums keep going up every year without coverage actually improving  shit where i work im already paying 120 a month just for my medical premiums and its going to increase to 140  oh you have a kid and need coverage for them too  thats 34 times that amount  all while you pay a medicare tax in your paycheck so technically you are paying for healthcare twice  like someone needs to really come at these companies for these costs  because i cant be paying all this and you still want to charge me 80 for a generic prescription
1973	1	he can get it
1974	1	no i havent read this one

1976	1	white guys say this shit to me plus an extra helping of transmisogyny so life is weird
1977	1	yes when im with white friends i dont exist ever its colorist and i guess unconsciously biased racism thats my opinion i hate it it makes me have low self value
1978	1	i know that person sounds like an idiot
1979	1	lol free speech its an internet forum run by moderators who have their own set of rules if you violate them you deal with the consequences freedom of speech does not equal freedom from consequence
1980	1	that sounds amazing
1981	1	this one is a nice reach as well all it took was one tweet that seems like it is sarcastic and one tinder profile before
1982	1	thank youdo you participate in these i hardly know where to start with these already existing can you say some changes has happened with attitude integrity body language etc i dont see enough boys or men participating in these things and this was my point with this organizations or groups existing but arent getting recognized or known enough
1983	1	tough in what regard im appalled that more often than not these types of underhandedly racist individuals hold management positions that in certain cases can cause people to be accused of things that have the potential to get them arrested all because they were shopping while black and coincidentally helping to line the pockets of those that see them as thieves its sickening
1984	1	my partner and i also live together and share bills for me the timing was off because at the time i was about to go through some career changes i was applying to graduate school in and out of state and there was uncertainty about where i would have ended up finances was the main reason though i didnt want to have to consider his income for financial aidgrants plus i dont want a 2 year engagement while i finish up graduate school planning a wedding and going to school would have been too stressful for me i totally understand about wanting to be claimed it seems like you have talked to your partner about marriage before maybe another conversation about it and your feelings may help some guyspeople can be clueless about proposing and even if you both live togethershare a life they still might fear rejection
1985	1	yeah this isnt uncommon but they all get introduced to my block list
1986	1	balding isnt a negative indicator of health though it is a natural genetic predisposition that can kick in no matter how healthy and virile a man is
1987	1	link to the black guy proposing to a racist sounds interesting
1988	1	wow i have never heard of these shirts before who would make something like that wtf
1989	1	how
1990	1	the majority of black men are not in prison what the hell this sounds like a white supremacist talking point
1991	1	yes i dont know if im searching wrong but there seems to be an overabundance of british media with mostlyallwhite casts and not much in the way of african content
1992	1	and jfc im reading on what you are saying about slavery and jim crow like the colonizers had fucking guns and people couldnt go against like seriously ughhhh
1993	1	i will see her posts sometimes twice a day i would love to have discussions on dieting and health as black women especially since im a vegetarian with an incredibly southern family but thats shit is just spam
1994	1	did he really say that wow since when does being a husband pull a paycheck
1995	1	wellp before i didnt know any better current boyfriend was the whole package when we met and i learned that i had definitely been working too hard in my last relationships hes the youngest guy i was ever with but in terms of maturity he was the most grown ive taught him little things here and there and weve grown together but my exes wanted a mom not a girlfriend i was always mom wife porn star masseuse cheerleader secretary and every little thing they needed its what i knew from watching my parents so i assumed that was what a relationship was ive learned not to do that after being completely run into the ground by these dudes i just wanted to feel important to someone mostly weve been through my people pleasing and constant giving in therapy so i know to reign that in
1996	1	what is crazy is both those defenses are better than what she actually said lol
1997	1	theyre pretty antiblack over there though especially towards black men the only reason their posts seem somewhat okay is bc they feel like theyre in a similar situation as black women in regards to dating etc they use what they perceive to be similar situations to reinforce their own toxic ideas about their relationship towards asian women otherwise i dont think theyd care at alleven in that thread alone ive already read some wild stuff in regards to black people
1998	1	thank you i thought i was going crazy tbh
1999	1	there is something romantic in simplicity like this i agree lol
2000	1	thank you congratulations to your friend both schools seem great ill have a tough time making a final decision haha
2001	1	my greatgrandpa only used a fully anglicized name i dont think it was the name he was born with  i have a pretty good amount of data on my greatgrandmamy grandma never could get more info on her fathers past and it seemed to frustrate her  there is no one living anymore who knew him personallywhy i think he immigrated himself is because how strange and foreign he seemed to my grandma and her siblings i do need to research the area because ive been told that he started a boys school
2002	1	honestly i think most of the people against it are lurkers most of them know it will be harder to spy on this sub if it goes private i think the regulars wont really have an issue since they are already here nothing would change for them
2003	1	so true whenever the nonblack people why are you here  posts  come up i always cringe at the responses the users here are not a representation of all black people but a lot of the non black lurkers have stated they come here specifically to learn about black people which is weird im sure a lot of them will read a comment by some random user who may or may not be black and apply it to all black people this isnt a place to learn about black people we dont all think the same also if you have to read this sub in order to interact with black people you have a problem
2004	1	for viewing you dont have to do anything tbh for posting you have to take a photo with your username showing like on a piece of paper you hold or something
2005	1	ah gotcha i felt largely the same as you growing up but i still think there were things i missed out on even if i want effected to the same level
2006	1	umm im not sure if there are plans to talk in the future it wasnt discussed i just offered my support and nothing has been discussed since he hasnt reached out since me telling him that so i dont know honestly im sad the relationship ended but his mental health is way more important than how i feel i just want him to be happy regardless if im in his life or not hes unhappy and i cant do much about it sadly i can be there to support him but only he can make the change which is the hardest to accept im  just accepting its done even though nothing has been said about dating in the future because i dont want to get my hopes up and its not fair to me to wait for someone when i dont even know if hell want to be with me later on if its meant to be it will be but right now i need to focus on myself i would be open to dating again but not soon
2007	1	definitely i wonder if they consulted anyone on the chicagopolitics part of it because mcqueen is not american and the script writer gillian flynn is the author of gone girl although mcqueen is black neither of them would be experts per se i know it is a remake of a uk mini series from like thirty odd years ago though so i wonder if politics was a part of that storyline and just happened to carry over well to chicagomodern times or if mcqueen and flynn added that inedit just read that flynn lives in chicago so i guess she is in tune with what is going on there
2008	1	yep i had myself on my bike and me right before a marathon i had my sharpie  from a triathlon  i had myself as spirit captain from the marathon team  i actually dont think i had any selfies i had a couple pro photos any time a friend said i looked nice i had them take a photo  photos for scale eg on a bike are coolim 510 im heavier than i look so i had a ton of photos  i also had a cat so i included his photo i only had one or two photos of me abroad  paris amp rio i think there was one photo of me wearing sports team stuff
2009	1	total mischaracterization of what im saying an intentional move to disregard the issue at hand
2010	1	feeling the same way really regretting watching this alone at night
2011	1	if this is about the petty paige thing because if so petty paige defended j and all his bs
2012	1	just no
2013	1	im not sure that sub exists
2014	1	yeah that is a plus and sad that it has to be said but it does since there are so many parents who dont pay child support or keep their kids fed with clean clothes though when you have millions like he does what could possibly be your excuse to not make sure the kids have what they need
2015	1	hey girl just a quick clarification latino is technically an ethnicity in this case hes a white latino but still i see where u coming from
2016	1	how old r u
2017	1	to answer your question it is clearly influenced by white supremacy true that person is responsible for their actions and consequently must answer for themselves but theyd be on about something else if it wasnt for white supremacy
2018	1	i never told them to stay in their lane out loud i fought with some white dude about the relevance of kwanza back in 2009 and exhausted my emotional resources for combat i rarely respond to this stuff nowadays but it still sets my brain on fire with anger got me wishing i was a fire bender so i could smoooke em
2019	1	shameless promotion accepted i love blackness and queerness
2020	1	no more lime two cool for school or something like that  i just realized this didnt explain anything  hes turning 2 so 2 themes are cute lol
2021	1	gurl preach i get so sick of that any time i go out  i was told that when i was getting some food at chick fil a this dude was like smile it looks good on you like no im trying to get my food and go it is so sexist and demeaning
2022	1	yup all they do is pass it along to the next generation im sure she is generation z or whatever generation is after millennials
2023	1	well when you think about it in order for a black man to become toxic like that theres have to had been women allowing this behavior to proceed but often times a lot of black women dont catch on and become emotionally unstable or end up with a child with a toxic ass black man a lot of times and ive seen loads of black women attest to this so if it isnt popular in here i guess it depends on the demographics and personality seeking black women choose the wrong men who fetishes them and exploits them on social media and we can do the same thing often times we have those black women who promote toxic extremism on facebook ig and twitter men and young me  take this as a sign to be extra alpha and toxic what im saying out of all that is a lot of women in black culture empower toxic men whether they intentionally know it or not and it just feeds dysfunctional i wouldnt say get american black men but men of color is a better way to broaden the options
2024	1	can somebody explain this to me i thought it was age but he is the same age i am how do they even fake justify it
2025	1	i need to delete my facebook before i get famous also surprised he doesnt have a good pr team they wouldve helped him nip this in the bud a long time ago
2026	1	gt my tinder profile used to say i get it boys youre fluent in sarcasm lol i wonder if this is an age thing and some of these 35 men havent just picked it up or held on to it too long
2027	1	im hoping so i had been looking on rosegalcom i think
2028	1	is that trevante rhodes
2029	1	no worries sis im not american am bermudian but the shit show is spilling over and it is fucking reprehensible i have a cousin in the states who was called an uppity black and was told hed be dealt with after trump was init is sad because these people being so loud is affecting and changing how the world viewed a country in only 2 years the best thing american did was elect obama and he brought so much respect from the world to americathis new lot that has risen up thinks that fearangerhatredridicule from the rest of the world is respect and now we look in and wonder what happened and why and hope that the glimpses of the tide turning for american continues and sooner or later they end up ok
2030	1	this video does some good explaining why they dont as well as a lot of other things that make the monarchy not look so goodhttpsyoutubeyie2dlqjb8u
2031	1	right
2032	1	good luck
2033	1	i clearly mentioned leadership and stewardship as well as career choice poor decisionmaking and setting bad examples
2034	1	i want to try out temporary wallpaper but im so so lazy
2035	1	gt question how do you know these men have issues with hypermasculinity the men in these groups are down to earth thoughbecause theyre raised with it even women have expectations of men that are founded in hypermasculinity no one is exempt and they need to take responsibility gtwhat i meant by trend is people ignorantly claiming they support or with the black feminist movement but use the term for their own propaganda in a way it can be used in means to destruct and disrupt a race if you have a few people who can market their page correctlythis isnt new or unique to black women either gtit is not a choice if they are not aware especially young men i know for sure they dont even know groups like this exist awareness falls on older men who are awarelike the ones who think they dont want to be lumped in with the others they can do the work to be the solution instead of trying to separate themselves from the problemgtthat is the thing they are doing that but it is not receiving any recognitionthe ones who arent like the rest need to step up and do the work just like we had to instead of expecting black women to pick up after them there is not one thing in this area black women have done that black men cant do too i sat and watched how few black men supported terry crews when he was assaulted and made fun of they need to do internal work before expecting us to step in even more or turn our spaces around to center them
2036	1	omg thank you im definitely going to try and find a pair
2037	1	yeah it likely is actually sorry
2038	1	chrissie already does all of the things youre talking about she created a platform called divine dark skinhttpswwwddsmagazinecom where she talks about fashion beauty dating tips etc for dark skinned women she promotes dds heavily on her youtube channel shes had her youtube channel for a while now and knows that just creating a space like that isnt enough to keep the trolls out there are a lot of people who think that catering to dark skinned women is divisive and counterproductive chrissie knows that its divisive and she doesnt care her first priority is creating a space where dark skinned black women are valued and appreciated and if she has to be divisive to do it then so be it
2039	1	validating people who actually feel that women and poc and lgbt are below them is actively harmful there are people who use comedians to justify their real life hate normalizing saying thinking and acting on stuff like that is a massive problem because the only thing keeping some bigoted people from flying their bigot flags is shame no shame no deterrent
2040	1	gti feel like art degrees are for people with connections and fuck  you money which the vast majority of black women are notthis is one of those hard truths we need to be more open about do them but after you get your own fuck you money find other lower cost ways to grow in your art in the meantime
2041	1	cultually yes it is an art i also advocated lesonshowever i think op should not beat herself up about not already knowing ultimately she can live a full life without ever knowing how to braid her own hair hypothetically she could shave her head tomorrow never let it grow out and never need to do ittldr  the op shouldnt beat herself up for not already knowing how
2042	1	that is not how any of this works just ignore it and itll go away is terrible horrible very bad advice for literally everything
2043	1	that is horrible if he married her in only three months im more inclined to you dodged a bullet not him
2044	1	i really think it is just that they arent actually that good at comedy they might have some natural talent for getting attention and a few laughs like they were the funny kid in highschool but they never grew beyond that with hart and seeing how his wife is reacting i think it is been a deliberate life long choice not to grow and to avoid people and things that push him to do better
2045	1	breakeven  you can let your repaid money sit there like a piggy bank  there isnt 100 repayment guaranteed so lending to the same folks repeatedly is a good ideathere are other organizations that charge interest but you have to lend more eg iirc some have mimiums of 1000  you can start kiva with 50 or less
2046	1	gtromantic relationships are not a portal to love and happiness i coped by realizing that no one was going to save me meeting someone would not make me happy if i wasnt already happy with myself i focused on finding loveintimacy with myself in friendships and family in work in my studies in animals i realized that part of decolonization was unlearning my huge focus on romance i think we are socialized to get so much solely from romantic relationships as a means of patriarchal controlthis is the honest truth i am happily married nowim 42but i spent plenty of time on my own and in bad relationships i will tell you the thing that nobody is going to tell you i have had some of my loneliest periods while in a romantic relationship people dont talk about it but everyone assumes just because youre with a partner that youre automatically blissful because you have someone to spend time with you by default but even if the relationship is good you need friends family etc to be a wellrounded and actualized personampx200bget off of social media most people only post the highlights and this will cause you to become miserable if youre comparing yourself to people is curated versions of who they are
2047	1	you dont really care if i have a nice day you just want to have the last word im not minimizing anything im putting things into perspective there are billions of christians around the world all with their own perspectives and lifestyles

2051	1	but you said you were tired of it did you read my analogy if youre tired of people ordering vanilla ice cream it means you want them to stop ordering it and get another flavor same thing for this thread and thanks for the downvote
2052	1	i dont know if its a joke i kinda assumed it wasnt cuz he has a white gf and the girls he posts arent black or are light skinnedi just reread it is as a joke tho pretty funny
2053	1	hahahaha are you jamaican my mum usually calls terrible handwriting crab toe handwriting
2054	1	there is multiple trending topics on this sub im not hip to all of them but googling donald glover wife donald glover im looking at you has shed no light on this discussion
2055	1	i do think that holding onto one is past mistakes is childish and unproductive to have to consistently bow down and address past ignorance over and over must be tiring he is an imperfect human just like you and i if the academy doesnt want him then so be it just as he has made so
2056	1	that is not really the point im making i dislike those posts for different reasons im just tired of people pretending to act shocked that nonblack men are antiblack women they make it clear each and every day that they dont respect black women what more do people expect it is not surprising that hey demean black women what is surprising is the amount of black women who give these asswipes the time of day and continue to do so after dealing with that bs

2060	1	you know movies and tv shows choose to cast light skinned children because of colorism right
2061	1	only visually appealing unless you watched the rest of the show it really left a bad taste after every episode and interview the more he spoke and admitted things that did not show a healthy relationship the more i realized their relationship only looked pretty
2062	1	i meant to type that joe biden is dem establishment politician not sanders why do you want him
2063	1	i agree i like the post that someone did recently where we did the dozens because she was sick and wanted something entertaining i liked your lighthearted post earlier like you said something light instead of just endless oppression and dating posts obviously as black women we are going to encounter oppression and so there will be some posts about oppression assholes struggles same with dating but all of black life isnt struggle and dating so more lighthearted stuff and like you said too more life improvement stuff
2064	1	yup black men just do bald better

2078	1	kiehls has great moisturizers and cleansers
2079	1	i just came across this comment on a random internet article about the john gray stuff and i think it captures what we both are saying pretty well wanted to sharegtas an evangelist i must quote the apostle paul when he said that everything was permissible but not everything is beneficial with that being said the bible tells us to not let our good be evil spoken of i agree that getting the lamborghini was not necessarily the problem but the negative speculation behind it due to pastors already living questionable lives with regards to church finances yes he does have multiple streams of income but the world views him as a pastor and not as a philantropist it is easy to say that people should not be hypocritical but arent leaders held to a higher standard regardless of income status and popularity jesus could have easily came with chariots horses and the likes but he was a humble servant now was it wrong for him to purchase the vehicle for his wife out of his own funds no however it should have been done more discretely instead of blasting it for the whole world to take notice you cannot dictate what people is opinions are if you make what should be your personal business for public display furthermore pastors should practice more modesty when it comes to their standard of living because the world is viewing us all through the eyes of a microscope and we are to represent christ not our own selfish ambitions regardless of how much money we have evangelist k l rich
2080	1	if you have all the context you see that pearl while shown to have grown fond of rose  literally is forced to do rose is bidding against her will

2084	1	thats a good idea and have check ins
2085	1	i really wanna talk about colorism and the fact that dating is entirely different for light skinned women compared to dark skinned women there is a huge disparity in who gets dates and who ultimately gets marriedlegitimized i was at a museum earlier today and easily 34 of bmbw families were mixed race women or light skinned women with keen featuresbut we cant have an honest discussion about that here the bf lurkers negativity impact discussion here more than the white lurkers yes i said it

2096	1	thisim kind of in a similar boat even to go so far as im not working right now i have income coming in but im basically a house spousethe reason im not working is treatmentresistant depression anxiety and ptsd unfortunately listening tofollowing the news creates a stress response in my body that is hard to come down from it is just something i have to accept i want to be more involved politically but not to the point that im willing to add the stress on top of the stressors that i cant controlbeing a black woman in the usbecause the women in my family die really young im about to start volunteering with a community organizer who is going to run for office ill do whatever she wantswithin the limits of my selfcareto help her get there i volunteer at my old job lowincome school about once a week i helped a friend get the word out on her gofundme and husband and i both donated because she is getting a bullshit eviction im also fielding leads and basically doing what i can to help her and her toddler stay safe right now until they find a place i would let them move in but we have zero extra space whenever someone needs help i offer to help if i canfeel moved to do so ive helped people move stuff given lots of rides fixed things etc i feel a lot of guilt because im not more informedup to speed on what is going on but i do vote in an informed way and i try to do other things to help ampx200b

2111	1	i dont get it either my mother and i visited the holocaust museum a few years back too and i definitely viewed it as a tragedy so im not sure the same view cant be applied here as well
2112	1	yes and it is a delightful trolling please by all means bring reason to let flow images of beautiful black women across my feed who am i to argue
2113	1	yep you can look at trends in their communities on and offline and tie them directly to psychological and mental health issues that is true for everybody but most of the rest of us had to face those facts a long time ago theyre still deep in denial that is why i think it is so important for us to be critical of their personal and cultural influence on us weve got enough to deal with already
2114	1	ok then that must suck to have pressure to stay within their race when aw some are notoriously known for being in relationships with men of european descent their frustrations arent far fetched right bw some carry the same frustration with bm some when the see the same thing bm being with nonbw i mean thats why the original post was posted and shared it became a talking point to vent and relate in different communities at the end of the day it seems these communities share the same struggles but cant openly relate to one another without backlash cest la vie
2115	1	haha yeah that wouldve been funny
2116	1	your friend was jealous of you and it sounds like she confused love with lust
2117	1	let is agree to disagree this was a good early morning conversation though
2118	1	5 on it has always sounded eeriemournful to me
2119	1	yeah
2120	1	gtit actually does at a certain level especially at the level he is spending we make choices and he chose to invest his money in an exotic car instead of helping someone or practicing good stewardship it was his choice but it was a poor decision for a pastor he chose a service job there is a reason the bible says that not many of you should presume to be teachers they are and should be held to a different and higher standard than the average personthat is the problem you assume he cant do both with 200k it is a lot and that is my total college tuition but you cant assume his intentions at all they absolutely should be held to a higher standard than the average person but its not a crime or a sin to want material possessions in itself especially if you dont know how much the pastor saved up or paid for the said posession at all if we dont judge poor people with iphones why should we judge pastors with one my pastor still has a computer a flat screen tv a smartphone etc it doesnt mean he is not managing his finances well or not helping members of his church you cant say that unless youre a member of his congregation my point is you cant assume his intentgtlike i said though the line might not be precise but it is well under a 200k car it might make you more comfortable to think people criticizing him are just playing devil is advocate but some of us are making criticisms because we care more about the church and its effectiveness than defending a man who makes silly financial and poor leadership decisionsit sounds though like you should read up on jesus teachings on riches probably starting with mark 10 he gave entirely too many warnings about them to brush this extreme situation off as some arbitrary critique over a couple thousand dollarseveryone of us here that are christian cares about the church and its effectiveness but it doesnt mean people like you and other christians and nonbelievers go too far in their criticisms of the church the church has to be beyond perfect but you even judged him because of his relationship with his wife a pastor cant admit he has marriage troubles now i am aware of his teachings on riches but you shouldnt twist them and take them out of context like him yes 200k is a lot of money for everyone and looks irresponsible but you dont know his intent and whether he is also helping his congregation and are only concerned about appearances when you should be concerned about both
2121	1	gtif you want a safe space for dark skinned women just form your forum around that and market yourself to your target demographic  over time you will attract the audience you want in an ideal world this would be the case but a disturbing percentage of the population does not respectadhere to stated boundaries if it is an open group there are always going to be a large amount of trollshaters in the group taking up timeemotional resourcesgt if a light skinned person comes to the forum its no big dealthis is not necessarily the case ive seen almost every serious conversation by ds women centering the experiences of ds women on the topic of phenotype coopted by ls women whinging about how hard they have it nobody is saying that ls women dont have their own struggles but stay in your laneampx200bfull disclosure i think im just somewhere in the middle but i do read the conversations because if it impacts my sisters  it impacts me
2122	1	wish i knew where to even start looking for it but i once read an article  about a study that found white upper middle class middle aged women had the highest rates of being shop lifters
2123	1	i dont understand why you feel like it is your duty to absolve black men of any and all personal responsibility for their own damn actions but youre seriously starting to get on my nerves black women deal with just as much if not more crap than black men and yet the majority of us arent acting like this they have chosen to be manchildren instead of doing better it is not just their circumstances
2124	1	agreed i love naptural85 and can watch her now with no issues but when i was still struggling with acceptance her channel actually made things worse i kept trying to style my hair using her hair techniques and when they failed for me because we have different hair types it made me hate my hair more
2125	1	oh god i remember that it is like they cant imagine a little black girl being the catalyst for anything positive plus  hello reading comprehension rue was always described as dark skinned loads of people just glossed over that of course
2126	1	agreed
2127	1	this is very true and interesting my mother southern has always warned about talking too much in public especially on online forums his comments are unacceptable and he should have simply apologized that being said many of my peers will not be able to achieve certain levels of political or public notoriety due to the terrible things they tweeted posted etc when we were teens i am blessed my mom encouraged me to be super politically correct online but what will our generation do i am 28 many of us have grown to be fully accepting and kind adults but we had to have a growing process in order to get there do you think cancel culture is helpful or hurtful to our progress
2128	1	wtf happened there how do you ruin wreck it ralph
2129	1	gt we still are in those statisticsthen center us in the question instead of black men gtmy comparison was intentionally meant to spark up a conversation pertaining to our men not coming up through numbers due to the lack of them not being present or uninvolved for whatever reasonwhatever reason is the issue they dont want to and that is evident with the organizations and groups they choose not to start and what they choose to share and not share on social and how quiet they get when even another black man steps forward with problems it isnt a numbers issue gtall of us need to be aware of what white feminist are doing theyre doing funky shit if anything i know more about them than us because of the trend they are setting and theyre making effort and demands on our properties in the southif we need to be aware of them it is in regard to how they impact our lives not how they interact with white men gti have to come off with a more friendlier stance and watch what i say you really dont you just need to center black women
2130	1	nah
2131	1	that is a fabulous book i must reread it  i find it prudent to take books like that then apply the lessons to different demographics and consider how i could better have handled situations
2132	1	what is the method
2133	1	i know all of this rationally i know about valtrex i know that if it is hsv i will probably have few if any further outbreaks and i know that the stigma is why the people i know who have it purposefully dont tell their partners but i cant shake my emotional reaction i tell my partners about having hpv even though basically everybody has it i was too old to get the vaccine when it first came out and by the time the age range was extended i was already diagnosed ive never had any outward sign of it but after years of abnormal paps i was finally told i have it and that is never been a big deal if it is hsv i will be forthcoming with my future partners because i know not speaking up is what got me here in the first place thank you for your supportive comment i needed to hear it even if im not close to believing it yet
2134	1	i think what bugged me was that i was playing a ranger with high dex acrobatics etc because i wanted to be a tiefling version of legolas i wanted to do some neat tricks to attack some enemies in a dungeon and all i remember was you cant do that  this isnt 4e or pathfinder where stuff like that is easier when i played pathfinder and tried doing some of the same things the dm simply said okay roll for whatever it was and that was that i dont remember what my husband specifically said but he said something like the system for 5e doesnt allow for freedom of doing cool tricks like fastball specials or something along those lines
2135	1	ahh very true culture can play a role in who is expected to propose i agree with you on that i personally dont plan on proposing to my partner but kudos to women who do
2136	1	this ref should have been fired long ago
2137	1	q dont we support lgbt or is there a black lgbt
2138	1	no but im constantly hearing about it what do you like about it
2139	1	same here lol
2140	1	i agree that dark skin isnt inherently ugly i wish others thought the same too but the reality for many dark skinned black women is that they will be treated differently in social settings based on skin tone alone
2141	1	black marriage wasnt strong because it was good it was strong because the women had significantly lower earning potential old relationships in general had higher success rates simply because women literally couldnt survive without men due to structural inequality now that a man is money is a plus instead of a necessity women will only stay if the marriage actually benefits them it usually doesnt men in general expect way way more than they offer
2142	1	i do believe in it thank you so much d
2143	1	tbh i just hear this often from other black women on reddit and other internet forumssocial media so thats how i assume it is i also get a lot of interest from black men but im only half black and whenever i try to say that dating has never been an issue for me im quickly shut down because my experience is different as a mixed woman which i understand and agree with my opinion is more towards black women who feel they have a hard time dating because of their race while purposely shrinking their dating pool by exclusively dating black men
2144	1	what is that
2145	1	your inability to show empathy over selfishness is concerning you ok sise typo
2146	1	i might one day but only when its necessary i did have a good time in sf and i felt a bit more comfortable in la mission but being from the south and being around majority black people they helped me notice even subtle antiblackness i would visit again but i want to be with a bunch of other black folks lol which part of the city your grandpa is from
2147	1	thank you that is wxactlyyyyy what im saying
2148	1	yes ive found some great music on there and im always so impressed with the sound quality
2149	1	oh yeah that is what i meant by willy nilly that a lot of people have some vague idea of good theyd like to do and think creating a nonprofit should be the first step but there is a lot of ways you can help your community within existing nonprofits and even outside of the nonprofit sector
2150	1	gthe also started only watching black girl porn after we started talking nowmaam
2151	1	congrats i guess
2152	1	not even she was capturing those victorian area girls no afro in sight just teased hair
2153	1	it is this sub as a whole
2154	1	dont feel bad i grew up the same way and now that i have kids its extra hard when my daughters were born my aunt told me while youre taking care of these kids dont forget about yourselfi dont know if youre a parent but the same principle applies are all your responsibilities handled cool now do something for you it doesnt have to be extravagant hire a cleaning crew for your home so you can kick back and relax go out to eat at that new restaurant buy that camera equipment
2155	1	ooh thanks im adding that to my reading list
2156	1	i guess we will have to agree to disagree on this one
2157	1	i am not sure at all but i would say yes lol i wouldnt be surprised our food culture is huge here
2158	1	it is understandable it is part of the job i hope you have better days and put the folks on ignore in your head when they talk that mess again
2159	1	wasnt there a toxic asian sub that literally crowdfunded a porn with a white woman for exactly the same reasons listed in that thread when it comes to pursuing white women as a form of sexual conquest all men of color are implicated its only easier for black men because they are hyper sexualizedmasculinized white men do this too but their conquests are obviously more racist
2160	1	maybe lol who knows the only place ive been to was paris they are super anti black and i didnt focus much on the dating apps during my time there i am also interested in spain too and i have heard stories from black vloggers in spain of their experiences on tinder and other dating apps they said spanish men were fetishizing them and focused on their skin color i dont know have to wait and see lol these are the few vlogs i watchedampx200b1 this is coming from an african girl and she is telling it like it ishttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5je7c0v6l5eamplistplhxljtux6mox8wi3w8oorvxoppzmkjtvxampindex2ampt0s just click the sentence and it will take you to the video2 this girl is from nyc and she went to italy for tourism and leisure purposeshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsco8pjafqb8amplistplhxljtux6mox8wi3w8oorvxoppzmkjtvxampindex23 she goes into detail about italian men and what the dating scene is like out therehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv6qcqoxmitqsampindex6amplistplhxljtux6mox8wi3w8oorvxoppzmkjtvx
2161	1	im so deaaaaaaaad remind me not to cross you
2162	1	bless thank you my heart can rest easy tonight
2163	1	gt it is literally wrong to blame a whole population of black menbut no one did that sogtmy sonboom that is all i needed to read every black woman ive ever come across that act like black men are perfect and dont you dare say anything bad about any one always has a sonfunny cause these same women have no problem oppressing other black women and telling them how they are even though they are women and these women are someone is daughters women like you are more harmful than the most racist white manbut go off i guess were just ol bitter angry black women and black males are so precious
2164	1	thanks
2165	1	i just dont like the idea of it i dont want to ask because i want to be asked ive spent my whole life being told no one would want me then being traumatized with that same message so i want to be wanted i dont know if thats sensical  i dont want to ask someone for their love i want them to proclaim their love to me if it was me asking it would be the same thing ive been doing in every relationship ive been in prior i want to feel worthy desirable and valued i would not feel that way if i did it i cant even wrap my mind around trying to do that do you offer him a ring do you buy your own ring then put it on i feel like that would embarrass the hell out of my bf especially if were out to dinner or something and i just put him on the spot like that and the roles are reversed
2166	1	interesting i went to a private school and my counselor saw my potential and even forced me to take an extra ap class i didnt want to take i hope they dont think every black person is jay z or something
2167	1	gtbut it is just a diet ampx200bcant tell them that
2168	1	this is a decision up to your friend some nursing mothers do not feel comfortable exposing their nursing child to any level of alcohol and that is fine it is not a waste of milk if that mother doesnt want to risk exposing their baby to alcohol
2169	1	thanks for responding i totally agree it is frustrating when things like this go viral it really does detract from pertinent issues that affect affect us
2170	1	i  dont blame ms marie
2171	1	i think it is the vague boring way it is been taught as a single subject especially in the states with the aim of balancing a checkbook that turns people off early advanced mathematics is sufficiently complicated we dont need to mystify it but even then it is really no more complicated than writing music weaving or braiding least of all the complex geometrical patterns in fact they are all related i could go on and on because real math like art is boldly true lol
2172	1	or youre getting healthier changes in perception that allow us to see things we didnt see before is an enlightening growing experience it is important to grow
2173	1	most of them tend to be but it doesnt stop them from looking depending on their position in the clergy since it tends to be more women than men in church the men may have more to choose from but there are sincere men in the church if you look hard enough just make sure that you have more than one churchreligious place to call home in different areasexperience 20 years as a jehovah witness now exjw over 3 years
2174	1	ah
2175	1	broke college student but id like to know more plz
2176	1	i think his first accuser is a black woman it seems like her allegations were largely ignored until the white women came forward
2177	1	yes this is my issue too in some cases i am read as black biracial or just plain hispanic in my location people in my country are very common so many are familiar with our look idk if everyone would agree i am black but i am impacted on some level by anti blackness it also weird being seen as more african than mestizo and white latinos and facing microagressions on that but still mixed
2178	1	i would have ghosted his ass so fast
2179	1	lol thanks it is really just the lighting my skin doesnt look half as good in person lol
2180	1	i really wished those marriage studies took phenotype into account the results would be very telling featurism and colorism affects our communities to a greater extent than i think wed like to realize
2181	1	idontevenknowi told him he is crazy for exploiting this group this way if he was going to do it it is best to do it around a black centered group he post in an unpopular opinion with a bunch of white and non black folk of course they ass gonna listen to your crazy delusional perception of black women
2182	1	sort of ive started and lead most if not all of them our membership is mostly younger students or folks in my year they look up to me and ive advocated for many of them in my situation so theres only so much i can put on them without scaring them and theres no one who is able to advocate for me besides myself
2183	1	thank you
2184	1	exactlyhumans need this cure
2185	1	im disappointed in myself for not thinking of the pokémon theme song until now
2186	1	yes definitely a favorite of mine
2187	1	very true perspective
2188	1	im not blaming black women im saying both men and women need to stop playing games period
2189	1	gtneckbearded motherfucker took two minutes out of his basement wow marathon to type that
2190	1	i thought so too until i read through his post history i think he is just hateful
2191	1	that why they are on the app and they lack charm  more the latter
2192	1	gt i will tell you the thing that nobody is going to tell you i have had some of my loneliest periods while in a romantic relationship say it again for the people in the back there is nothing worse than being lonely while in a relationship even with a wellrounded social group there were times i felt alone within my relationshipi have been in good relationships that had bad times and the feeling of being alone within a relationship was more heartbreaking than being single period now that im single i do still feel lonely but honestly the peace i get knowing that no one can stress me like they can in a relationship is worth itop dont be fooled by what you see in social media or even by what people tell you they wont tell you the hard parts of being in a relationship
2193	1	right almost like she is robotic maybe shes not great in front of the camera but she seemed so disinterested and dry  agreed always team serena
2194	1	that sounds amazing considering that we have been experiencing crazy rain for the past month the weather here is so depressing id love to move somewhere with the heat etc but in southern africa and by the coast  if south africa didnt have such high crime levels im sure id be there now maybe namibia would be good but hey for now its just a dream
2195	1	that first line is methis is excellent advice
2196	1	how dare he buy a lambo isnt about envy though it is about your spiritual leader endorsing materialism conspicuous consumption i have a huge problem with a spiritual leader engaging in such foolishness and could not accept such a person providing me with any kind of leadership let alone the exploitative nature of the relationship between him and his parishioners working class people tithing so your wife can ride around in an obscenely expensive luxury performance vehicleit is obscene flexing like a rapper with money you conned from someones grandma is not enviable
2197	1	i feel the same about gay and gaybros
2198	1	theres a reason the only time free speech as a talking point comes up mostly for white nationalists and comedians blatant bigotry and ironic bigotry for those that dont feel comfortable being blatant yet
2199	1	there is no war just angry people on the internet
2200	1	thanks
2201	1	shes one of my favorite actresses its a shame her husband cheated her she seems like a really nice beautiful woman
2202	1	honestly preach i get particularly bothered by moc not being supportive of us doing what we please my significant other is white and ive heard plenty on how im basically betraying my race when i see black men on twitter and other platforms shitting on black women being ghetto uneducated angry loud violent you name it dont call me a beautiful queen or whatever woke bs you want to spout and then try to criticize my choices as a beautiful queen because you werent my choice this time around naturally ive had issues of white men while dating  of course  but i honestly thought the people that looked like me would be a little more supportive in my autonomy racial freedom is only applicable to black men apparently
2203	1	and the city i live in is black as hell a lot of the city culture is rooted in blackness whiteness isnt a good thing at all because its linked to white supremacy
2204	1	he is keeping real hush about it the trailer is supposed to be released on christmas eve thoughedit i lied  httpsewcommovies20181220jordanpeeleusfirstlookphotos

2206	1	teachers are judged more strictly the bible is very clear about that am i going to go protest his purchase no but he doesnt get the claim the im just human defensegtand some of these dont apply like the proverbs ones how is he withholding good or graineven if he is leasing the car it is a smooth 3000 a month he is a sitting servant of god and his choice to spend that money on a vanity purchase is also an opportunity not to help someone most decent pastors draw their income and purchasing lines at middle to upper middle class for that exact reasonampx200bgtand he said he didnt spend the churchs money so 20 or 300 xbox if it came from his book sales hes not wrongyou responded to a comment about spending church money on an xbox that is what i was responding toampx200bgtbut speaking of the churchs money surely we expect him to use his actual church salary on himself as far as basic needs maybe thats not what you meant what would yall have him spend his money on if he cant buy an xbox should he give it all away again where is the line and who draws itthe church is money and his salary are two different things just to clarify what i was saying also who is yallive already answered this but youre tossing out extremes to avoid addressing how extreme his purchase was if it were a benz or even a porche nobody would really be talking dont paint this as if anyone is trying to deny him basic needs or even moderate luxury he is stepping into a lifestyle even most of the 1 dont dabble in
2207	1	chucklefuck
2208	1	i dont think thats creepy at all appearance isnt everything but the way you present yourself says something about you its human nature to make these snap judgements unfortunately we dont live in a utopia
2209	1	its weird how black people claim white people dont see a difference between mixed and biracial lighter skinned black people and darker skinned black peopleespecially since white people love expressing how beautiful they think mixed babies are
2210	1	yea you have to have a pic with your name and date on it then 48 hours youre accepted or not
2211	1	well  you have just sent me into a buying frenzy or i will be getting into one soon  this is all just so beautiful   ive now created a black business folder on my internet browser
2212	1	youre correct i didnt know what the comments would look like but i agree save me damn it we can always make babies but what you cant do is once im gone replace me as a motherwife
2213	1	a cleaver thing to is focus on specific women especially black women that youve met that have had certain traits maybe even stereotypical traits and not generalize all women of any race into one box  for example its probably not a good idea to say i met a black woman and she loved fried chicken so much hahaha so funny but they can turn the stereotype upside down on its head while talking about a specific person like she likes fried chicken ahaha but so what not only  black people like fried chicken thats crazy man thats crazy i love fried chicken and i dont care if im black so what anyone can eat fried chicken i love fried chicken a nuance like that is essential as a comedian youre making fun of the actual stereotype itself rather than letting a racist stereotype overpower your act youre also clearly calling the stereotype crazy not making offensive jokes doesnt mean you cant make jokes it just means youre not talented enough to come up with jokes in the first place there are comedians out there that dont make offensive jokes and thats because they probably know how to use nuance
2214	1	in a way they are you literally have blacks who cant speak proper english have decent clothing stuck in dumb situations and so forth which is preventing a lot from achieving life goals they brought nasty hip hop back to promote sex money women gangs and poverty we victim blame ourselves for not keeping an eye on our children but forget these higher white people have the system to the point social media random teachers music television etc  teaches our children when they are away from our homes this society is built for dark skinned women to spend and dedicate more time to school and work than her own children and men if they are good men anyway not to mention forces mothers stress out about their babies and children some of their practices involes drugging their children so they can do better at school and work everyone does not have the mind power like your mom i bet the percentage is still high with depression self harm drugs sickness etc than those who struggled more to achieve a better job or education that puts them through more pressure once they pass stage 10 i believe if we just crush all outside interaction with races who mean to harm us and work up our own nationality we dont need to struggle more
2215	1	note that my question was not about how people identify as i asked what constitutes as being black to you according to your reply you think black is a race i accept your perception howeverif indeed black meant race to all then solely curious would have been accepted by her peers as a black person therefore it appears that black means different to different people and learning about this  difference is the point of my thread
2216	1	this sub is for content that interests black women and for discussion that centers our perspective content doesnt have to be explicitly about black women
2217	1	i want 2 dope queens back so bad what happened queens phoebes did you guys get in a fight i neeeeeed you
2218	1	your opinions are unpopular because theyre oversimplified to the point of absurdity youve latched on to a certain kinds of women as somehow being responsible for toxic men just by dating them that is not how any of this works shifting blame to the people who date toxic people is completely side stepping the actual problem the vast vast majority of toxic people are smarter than showing their entire hand  from the beginning they trickle the mess in slowly once theyve already start to build something because they know it is harder for people to leave youre really trivializing this entire problem
2219	1	im not youre minimizing them but i see why now again have a nice day
2220	1	greetings  thank you for the education  my husband were briefly stationed in scotland  i still dont understand british politics

2226	1	not to intrude but isnt it a bit toxic for you to be with a man that doesnt want black children that makes me question what are you to him a fetish men that think dont want a certain race or certain skin tone of babies typically will not treat their babies with love im actually hurting for any of your unborn children because they cant help the shade or their skin nor have any reason to

2248	1	i said meps not mps last i heard there were grumblings from brussels about cancelling brexit in the event of no deal and arguably referendums arent in line with the representative democracy of the parliamentary system especially when it was a nonbinding referendum especially especially when the major probrexit side was taking money from russia
2249	1	i wouldnt be surprised if that were the case reddit is awfulits also weird because the same complaints listed in those tweets about black women white men with yellow fever say about white women the antiwhitewoman part of that thinking comes down to pure misogyny rather than racismi think the most twisted part is when men of color pursue white women as some fetish its because of internalized racism against women of color all of this mixed with misogyny of course its a clusterfuck and to a large degree in this case white men are responsible for the racist underpinnings because white men fucking suck
2250	1	not sure how legit this is or not because starting with  i grew up in a black family is highly suspicious to me but assuming you are genuine and not just trolling i think this because when it comes to getting hired nothing is truly based on hard skills even in stem despite the narrative that is been pushed by stem job creators and companies there are plenty of qualified candidates with the right educational and technical credentials the  only thing standing between any qualified stem candidate and getting the job are individuals with their own biases and they are really only judging you on soft standards once you get beyond say a phone or technical interview are you a fit for company culture do you know how to communicate well do you already know someone in the company who can vouch for you in other words are you going to shut up do your work not cause trouble for the company and make the company money now apply race and racist stereotypes to any of these soft standards and you might understand why these stem spaces are so heavily white and asian and male if im a white guy in a mostly white company whose mostly been around other white people all my life i might deem you a bad fit because you seemed like you had an attitude and who would even be able to claim it was about race no one people are still using their middle names or changing their names so that their resumes wont be trashed or judged because they happen to be named alizay and that is before even being looked at  this doesnt change just because alizay is applying for a stem job
2251	1	team naija  and same it is nothing more than a dish storage unit lol
2252	1	every single argument youve made has already come from white people in defense of colorismprotest of intentional spaces as well as people who dont see a need for womanism when feminism already exists im not going to debate the same tired old bullshit hereampx200bgti cant take you seriously because it doesnt sound like you actually read what i saidok i dont know what to tell you on that front i did read your responses i just dont agree with most of your points ampx200bgt it seems like you want to sit there in anger and hyperinsulate yourself from the outside world which is not a healthy coping mechanism and does nothing to solve the problem im not angry but so what if i was anger has validity and so does an individuals desire to remove themselves from harm again same old tired bullshit i havent experienced this level of derailing in a looooong timeampx200bgthealthy discourse can should help and people dont focus enough on thatyou dont know what people deal with in their daytoday you dont know how much healthy discourse people are engaging in all day every day irlim in favor of giving people a space where they can seek fellowship commiserate and relax if this vetting method is going to be what it takes to allow her to do so in the space that she creates im all for itampx200bgtwhile not actually reading or addressing my argument properlywelcome to the internet friend i read what you wrote and only deemed a small percentage of it worthy of a reply the idea that there is a proper way to address your argument implies youre somehow entitled to my timeenergy  you are not
2253	1	i think it is up to each person to do what they want to optimize their lives and that there is not necessarily a right way about partnerships or finding yourself i personally find it condescending and annoying when i say i want to find a partner and make a genuine effort but get harshly mistreated or dealing with shitty people and i get a bunch of platitudes about why i shouldnt try why it is somehow my fault or people literally in relationships telling me theyre not a big deal or everything in life when im well aware theyre not everythingthat is not to say people cant be unhealthy about it but i hate being told to stop trying you wont get anywhere in life apart from dumb luck if you dont make an effort to seek out things you want or need maybe you dont need to spend every night trying to find a partner but you can be a well adjusted conventionally attractive well off and secure person in a good position to be in a relationship and still not get anywhere
2254	1	what is your family last name origins have you talked to any elders from there there were indeed tribes that are african mix fighting for rights they are some fighting for rights as native americans majority of those in the south has family to earn that right to be treated as a native or native african itll be cool to look into that my fam are from the coastal parts of georgia fl and sc youll find some gulla geechees seminole and other bands of creek and cherokee indians this brings which tribes were allies with africans and europeans because for example my family are allied with the irish but on another side they were slaves under the irish it is just a bunch of twisters that arent really recorded we all need to get in touch with the elders or those who are aware because were all related to one another some of the natives in my family migrated to the west indies before the slavery so you should get some answers just by centering yourself around those people these people will tell you which lineage youre from just by your name bc of how small knit they are but once again it is not known because it is not talked about the only thing is known is were african descendants when really we hold a lot of keys and answers to who we are my family whom i never met before in my life still keep in contact with those in africa till this day it is just crazy how so much information is lost and how they try to hide who we are and what we are entitled to
2255	1	i guess because ive read some of the experiences not only on this platform and they simply dont ring true for me ive never felt like i didnt want to be black or wasnt black enough telling me i wasnt like other black people has never been a compliment and i never thought i was different or better than other black people simply because i might have interests that are not stereotypically associated with black people oh and i always try my best to give the nod as well i might not get along with every black person i dont think that is how it works but there is something special about being in good black company it puts me at easeall that made me wonder where others are coming from
2256	1	what about your own ethnicity made you uncomfortable do you think the outside viewopinions about your ethnicity or group played into the way you felti do wonder what it would have been to have grown up with an actual black community around though in the town i grew up in there was only one nigerian family on the other side of town
2257	1	on top of this being a horrible reflection of internalized racism i dont understand why peoplesay this kind of thing out loud do they think folks will respond with congratulations
2258	1	it might not be as bad as you fear to be the only poc and the least experienced i was for my group and some nights i was the only girl on top of all that and people were absolutely lovely i adored my group i stopped going because my dm was a bit railroady and were moving on no no weird looting keep going and combat in a 10 person group is slow as all fucking hell but not due to any issues with others i had the same concerns as you before i went
2259	1	yea i always thought that the whole point was that most of the characters are ignorant and problematic  also a pretty good representation of a small town company atmosphere though obviously exaggerated especially michael scott
2260	1	youre right im being histrionic but i have pretty good intuition for these things since i cant get to the gyno before the lesions are healed i took lots of pictures to show her when i go in it is not looking so good
2261	1	youll love it the elders are still keeping it alive there their language is beautiful and theyre peaceful people they also told me more people dont know about it and spread the darn word because a lot are missing their family
2262	1	yeah i think they were called instead  ive seen them repurposed and rebranded lately as a fertility aid and then also made in black for period purposes

2267	1	you really have to ask your doctor at point blank as to why they prescribed a over b or think you have disease y instead of z  they either have a well thought out  honest answer or something else that will let you know their intentions
2268	1	i often use a diy mixture o keep my skin moisturized and it helped me deal with my dry skin issues i use the loc method not only for my hair but also and especially for my skin when i get out of the shower i make sur my skin is still damp not fully dry and seal in the moisture with my diy mixture of coconut oil olive oil shea butter and vitamin ei let my skin absorb the moisture and oils for a few minutes while i brush my teeth and what not before wearing my clothes sometimes when it is really cold or when i feel like it i will seal the moisture with my diy mixture of oils and vitamine e and lock all the moisture in with a cocoa butter cream i have yet to try natural diy soaps and perfumes
2269	1	bless you im not a parent but i help with my brothers and try my best to help to minimize their stress load im realizing im way too hard on myself my therapist reminds me often so thanks for the reminderim going to go look up a prime lens it is reasonably priced and within my budget

2273	1	i agree even panther fought better in civil war the fight choreography in civil war was absolutely incredible but as a whole movie experience i dont believe there is five marvel films better than bp im not saying it has to be your number one i fully admit there is room to argue that some of the others guardians civil war heck even antman are betterbut when you look at how great the film work was the world building the villiain and the representation which i think should count for something in a universe where we literally have 3 4 heroes named chris black panther is top tier material even with the final fight potentially being the worst fight scene in the entire mcu right now i mean i can understand that tom hildston is a handsome guy but loki as a character is kind of a joke that ive never understood i still dont get why more people arent annoyed at doctor strange being a carbon copy of iron man with a better and more interesting final fight
2274	1	in the former life situation i was in every circumstance that i had a chance to sue there were several i was convinced by my father not to sue

2279	1	congratulations
2280	1	thank you their experience is just as valid as the op there are many black women who are not approached by black men or have negative experiences dealing with black men romantically and they shouldnt feel bad about sharing their experience just like black women with the opposite experience should be free to do the same without coming for the black ladies that dont share that experience just like you black men dont approach me i went to a predominately black high school and there was one white guy and he was the only guy that approached me during that stage of my life
2281	1	see thats what im afraid of i keep whipping out my tub accidentally then shooting trying to figure out how to put it away i ask ride my horse like an asshole according to another character edit my gun not my tub see my thumbs dont cooperate

2284	1	thanks for answering i edited the last 2 questions if youd like to answer
2285	1	your points here i also agree with and my first point didnt contradict the one in the original post i personally know of our kind whove gone viral amp whove been exposed to stuff that ordinary folks couldnt even begin to think existhere youve brought up appropriationyep theyve been taking our hustle also known as us just being us and getting paid off of it the reasons for this i havent a clue
2286	1	me too context applies since i came to north america and reddit as well ive realized that black wasnt just for dark color people eg arguments about public figures like meghan markle so i am just curious to learn why people use black as an identifier for themselves and othersor even if they dont
2287	1	i think the hype will be real once we get a trailer which i imagine has to be coming soon with the movie coming in 3 months or so i read more details about the movie exploring the consequences of unplugging from technology looking forward to seeing how that plays out
2288	1	nah youre right to be annoyed i hate when you tell someone something and they have no problem telling other people what you just told them when asked about someone else is business the correct thing to say is you should ask them

2292	1	youre speaking the truth and insecure self haters can only react with downvotes thankfully this toxic internet culture is far from realityive seen so many beautiful black couples getting married recently and most of the black women i know are dating black men which also means black men are dating black women  so taboo i have a healthy balance of mentally healthy black women and men in my life its not a bunch of self haters who constantly push a antiblack womanman agenda i love seeing black communities that reject colorism and self hate
2293	1	black to me covers anyone who is african or of african descent when im identifying with all black people worldwide and yes jamaican is when im specifically identifying with jamaica for my culture

2302	1	because i never fit in and unlike a lot of lighter folks i know who tried super hard to compensate with more stereotypical behavior i stuck with my books and didnt bother when i was a kid they told me i  isounded white and the girls did the whole bullying because  ishe thinks she is cute thing i even had one tell me i didnt scar the way she did like i was a completely different kind of human smh blackness was always a set of behavioral rules and expectations to me more than anything else it was only when i got older and started achieving things that people started talking about how black i was and how i have all these community responsibilities to give back i get that people see me as black and will treat me like a black person but race isnt a part of the way i define or see myself ive just never had that sense of belonging or acceptance
2303	1	i think im going to see that movie tomorrowwhy do you need more female friendsi feel ya on the crap weather  we boston have been having gorgeous sunny day after gorgeous sunny daybut temps max out at like 35f

2307	1	he sure did but it looked like the claw of love and pride
2308	1	it can lgbtq spaces can often be overwhelmingly white and white gays are in no way immune to racism the only ones who are happen to be the ones who have made the effort to educate themselves on intersectionality and are actual antiracists it is why i quit dating white women my last partner was white and she was deeply problematic on this issue she even compared fatphobia to racism i made a promise to myself i will never ever have that power dynamic in an intimate partner relationship again ever id have to screen very hard for antiracist credentials prior to even considering it again
2309	1	didnt mention morals though if you want someone to stop doing something you want someone to stop doing it its common sense if youre tired of peoole ordering vanilla you want people to stop ordering vanilla so that you can have other flavors otherwise why are you still subscribed
2310	1	thank you i will definitely look you up
2311	1	i just feel like she sounds dumb and her mediocrity is overlooked because shes a sexual object but what do i know
2312	1	females really on this sub
2313	1	please point out where exactly i blamed you for everything
2314	1	yeah but that is not what op is saying theyre saying dont be shocked when a black person has a different political view than you and they should be allowed to have a different view it is things like you cant be black and a trump supporter that leads to black people saying shit like they dont consider me black enough they think im a white man in white spaces
2315	1	this one of my closest friends had a mastectomy last year breast cancer and got an implant so shed look symmetrical again vanity maybe but i dont think theres anything abnormal and wrong about trying to make your body  and life  feel as normal as possible after dealing with that kind of trauma
2316	1	how does another person is grades diminish your accomplishments your accomplishments stand on their own are you still in school now i think your position will change when you finish school and enter the workplace
2317	1	yeah it looks nice i just keep justifying why i should wait another month to get it

2321	1	sorry about the breakup but this is an opportunity for such growth you may not even recognize yourself in six months wishing you a great 2019
2322	1	i dont know but it makes me think of how howard dean had to drop out of the election in 2004 because of his scream but then donald trump gets elected after saying he grabs women by the pussy what is and isnt enough to be cancelled makes no sense sometimes
2323	1	im sorry hope you have all the support you need love is eternal so you and you grandma will always have that may she rest in peace

2326	1	any black man who can allow a nonblack woman to say that to him in bed is sick i dont care if it is donald glover or a nonfamous black man weird and sick
2327	1	i think you replied to the whole thread instead of someones specific comment  just wanted to let you know ive done it on accident before too
2328	1	they do it is just that the bad ones end up representing the entire group ie generalizing there are black men that act the way op described there are tons do not there are black women that act the way op described there are tons that do not people in general have a tendency of focusing on the negative and using that while all the positive interactions are less focused on what is funny is this rarely happens with white men this op could have had tons of bad experiences with white men but i doubt she would generalize them since white men are afforded the luxury of being looked at as an individual and not representing their group
2329	1	she still slept with a taken man she is no innocent way offset is i am surprised they lasted this long
2330	1	i hope youre right but then look at the stereotypes tyler perry lokes to propagte in his movies him being the first black owner of a movie studio and everything
2331	1	it doesnt apply to college admissions what
2332	1	because the us and other major powers are just as guilty if any one nation starts doing something about it i have a feeling itd destabilize the status quo pretty quick which imo needs to happen but centrists and conservatives love the status quo so and the nations most affected by this colonialism are the least empowered to do anything about it
2333	1	ahh i get you now the shit surrounds us so its not easy to not think that at times but balance is a must you got a link to that video sis im gonna search for it but a link would be helpful for the lazy e or bro
2334	1	i think its more along the lines of a black person would be a fool to support this than someone losing their blackness which exsts regardless m and thats the case among all non white straight men not just black folk
2335	1	absofuckinlutely try having family that works forin the church i was there 3060mins before 8am service depending on how much the choir needed to get ready through to 930 bible study then 11am service which would end somewhere between 130300 depending on how many people caught the spirit then fellowship in the kitchen afterwards because by this point everyone is so hungry theyll wait for a plate as someone that used to be praised in church for being silent and still during this 8hr weekly trial this kid giving zero fucks makes him my hero haha
2336	1	buying a car is never a way to establish intergenerational wealth a car is a depreciating asset even a lamborghini is a depreciating asset buying a car that is not a depreciating asset would mean you would have to buy a vintage car with an unimpeachable pedigree that has been maintained to the highest standards or you would have to buy a modern limited run ultrasupercar of the supercars that costs over 1 million dollars and then never drive it and keep it in a museum so no this shady pastor is not setting a good financial example for us negroes because 999 of the time buying a car is not a good financial investment that will build wealth   and if you wrote this to say that just because these pastors seem to be rich means that are setting a good financial wealth example for us then i disagree with that too because i bet most of them are in debt up to their eyeballs all that glitters is not gold

2341	1	racism is not the right word here at all ugggh
2342	1	i dont think so you phrased your post as in bm are always the issue when something goes awry in relationships also even if what you said were true it would only be a function of the fact that bm and bw interact the most not as function of devaluing bm its like saying people who drive cars get in more accidents than people who walk its obvious but its only a function of probability i think the black man holds the black woman in the highest regards in most respects and that is why i took issue with your post
2343	1	oh that would be cute two cool for school with a rock amp roll theme two legit to quit would be cute too
2344	1	wait im confused why is someone posting on here and on the asian incel thread why are black women in the asian incel community

2355	1	yes youre right it wont solve any problems or help my career situation it is not the money or gifts im interested in it was the idea of having more established successful partners to do things with i genuinely thought the situation could be fun or at the very least entertaining but my skepticism is what brought me to reddit to get feedback on my situation after hearing people is responses im recognizing that most situations are hard work and not the type of work im looking to invest a lot of my time in thank you for your response
2356	1	free entry has 2 floors and a back room the upstairs sometimes has special performances and you have to pay a small fee 1020 the music is usually hiphoppop dj or a live performances in the back room its fun great place for a date or small group of friends the website httpswwwpianosnyccom will show the upcoming events
2357	1	i cant assure you that he is but judging from what i see i can say hes likely to be predominantly white
2358	1	what are you watching in the meantime
2359	1	not really i read several accounts of women with straight hair trying box braids and they all talked about pain not only that but it slips so much that it comes out of the braids in seconds
2360	1	oh ok my bad
2361	1	shame on her then yeah it probably comes from a neurotic place of whatever abuse she is been through herself but we all gotta grow up sometimeif anything youre looking to the future a future where generations will be unmarred by such abuse
2362	1	i thought the black professor was the art professor
2363	1	im sorry girl  i know that pain and ive been there i remember being 18 and hating my body please know that it does get better and one of the best things you can do is not to consume too much media with the perfect body archetype it sucks that it is so present today i was 18 a long time ago i cant imagine the pressures young people go through today with twitter and ig and youtube bombarding them with perfect bodies
2364	1	nielson rating articlechart httpswwwnielsencomuseninsightsnews2017forusbyusthemainstreamappealofblackcontenthtmlim not sure whether or not it has been posted i think i was way more interested in the amount of black viewership or lack thereof than anything even moreso when i noticed that a huge portion of black americans watch shows like real house wives id figure the script to be flipped more whites interested in that but reality tv is hard to stomach for me so im biasedher point about having so many white people liking something meant for blacks struck a chord though i am actually super surprised the black american viewership is where it is i really dig insecure although i do agree with a few points how having african identifying or uk blacks tell a story that a black american could tell as far as main characters  im conflicted thereas far as the minstrelsy bit i think a good deal of what is shown in insecure are things blacks deal with or have dealt with on some level other people too i think it is a step away from the impoverished struggling black trope we are used to seeing which i dig or something that isnt a tyler perry concoction i dont think it is pandering but i can believe insecure hits a different demographic
2365	1	what is a symptom for depression exactly looking weird or having a cat sleeping in your neck or bothp
2366	1	prejudice hate why is it hate racism prejudice and self abuse when one speaks about building black communities and you have all these other ethnicities doing it becoming nations and building contracts with the government the government our communities have no wealth no power or opportunities because we are constantly giving our worth to people whose focus on mental enslavement and money ive never said separating ourselves but being equal basically i have a stance of true equality equity like malcolm x not mlk we dont have equality if we are stuck in slums and poverty equality isnt getting better jobs better european education better living opportunities in modern european build homes spending money and putting wealth into their pockets that is not prejudice or hate our numbers is low but our statistics is high that is not equality that is not freedom that still enslavement and im not even trying to debate about it as much bc the numbers dont lie about the financial struggle lack of parenthood lack of education lack of health services lack of jobs lack of every thing no one still havent responded to the sections i mentioned small communities in the south are built with asians japanese north africans south africans jamaicans middle eastern etc everyone has some type of structure but us
2367	1	its not a problem for me  its a problem for all the little black and brown girls who learn that their natural hair is not good enough and its better to have european hair  i dont see a lot of wigs made of kinky hair on my instagram feed  we need to think about what message we send our kids
2368	1	honestly thats such a good idea im surprised this sub doesnt have a groupme chat or something
2369	1	i agree that black men have been affected by eurocentrism and i didnt mean to turn on black men i dont hate being african but i once was insecure about my skin colour my personal reason for being insecure in my eyes was hearing stories like i just mentioned within my community and online even from my own father who is black im sorry i didnt mean to generalise maybe it was more of an expression of my personal experiences i would never defend a racist nonblack man just as much as i wouldnt accept the same from a black men
2370	1	i think people have their own ways of being attracted to other people but i do think a ton of us are also talking ourselves into attraction and settling or maybe even performing attraction the older i get the less attractive and interesting i find men in general not in a sexual orientation way but more like this is boring now i have older friends who still act like a sweaty muscular 25 year old is something to get excited about i see it i get why he is hot but it just does next to nothing for me i think that is why ive never been into strip clubs just why it is also why when i am attracted to a man especially physically im completely thrown off lol but maybe it is just what demisexuality over time looks like
2371	1	if you took the time to actually read the issue is optics1111ok and not the fact that a lot of black women are tired of black men openly bashing and putting them down in favor of light skinned andor nonblack women i see where your priorities are and they dont lie with black women saying black women are ugly is literally incomparable to saying im tired of black men but go off i guessalso lol at antiblack misandry you know its extremely sexist to quantify the worth of black women by saying yall are supposed to be our mothers sister nieces as if our only value is the fact that we are attached to yall your ass is showing here and knowing that i can see why you resort to silencing black women as opposed to listening to us you can take that misogynoir somewhere elseif that post shows a lack of solidarity between us guess what its because there is colorism sexism and homophobia play a role in that instead of talking about the problem youd rather silence us in and force us to shuck and jive so that whitey dont know guess what chuck white folks know regardless look at a large portion of black male celebrities dripping in misogynoir you wanting to silence black women only deepens the issuesim glad youre banned good riddance you can go silence black women and put on a fake show for white people all you want and in blackfellas yuh know a space thats actually meant for youalso look at the edit that op made your argument is trash my guyi accidentally deleted my response multiple times and i am frustrated
2372	1	gt but what is a pastor supposed to do once a church starts growing turn people away have church outside in an open field and church staff provide real jobs for real people its trickybuild a modest building that doesnt rival convention centers and hotels there is middle ground here that people are completely ignoring i think partially in bad faith gtbut i believe he should be paid for the job he does and responsibility of his congregation that is on his shoulders and not mine preaching counseling hospital visits etc thats a lot of heavy work and i want the lights in the church to be on when i get there lol a church is an organization real talk takes money to run like onei was raised in the church and am very aware of what it costs to run a church and what pastors do as well as others in the church i believe pastors should be compensated but never at a level where exotic cars are on the table plus if his responsibility is that big the support he receives should align with the seriousness of what he is responsible for extravagant monetary support is one of the last things they need gta church is an organization real talk takes money to run like onethis has little to nothing to do with what pastor is paid since pastors seldom do the work of keeping a church going this is even more true the larger a church gets john gray isnt out there doing the admin work

2375	1	trump and his associates have a massive scandal on their handsim not downplaying the costs of war and it is incumbent that we as a society grapple with how our military is used im no fan of the axis of evil bs bush tried to pull on usnow when it comes to undermining  confidence in public institutions trump has bush powell and rice beat by a country mile that includes war on a false pretext
2376	1	lol wouldnt be surprised tbh
2377	1	i agree with your comment  i am not sure where the downvotes are coming from  stay strong confident and positive
2378	1	pretty much this this subreddit gives so much time to peopleideas it supposedly doesnt like there is so much miring in negative energy and it is sad if a black man did this with asian women the energy would be different as it should be
2379	1	im open to this conversation here its actually helping me understand what could be causing alot of the anger in our black men and mistreatment towards us and others
2380	1	i have those thoughts all the time
2381	1	ugh yes i actually recently had a black man tell me i should have just been patient and waited for a black man to come into my life he said  we just be fucking with white girls when were immature no one really wants to marry a white girl theyre just easy and constantly throwing at us yall are a lot of work and you gotta wait for us to mature to be ready for youthe crazy thing is he said this while we were in conversation with a latina girl and she still tried to get w him
2382	1	absolutelynot saying otherwisewhat i meant is not invalidating others experiences maybe i should update the postand i was under the impression that privacy just meant that mods had to approve who joined
2383	1	im going to be honest i had to relook at privilege definition and it was used correctly i can say i never thought of that but wouldnt that be considered a natural right since they only controlinteract by strength and superiority through tone and body language which is natural and natural can be positive or negative and also we have a lot of toxic men but at the same time we have good ones that are being wrongly convicted or accused which is high am i missing a link or something on how to lessen generalization or categorization black men as a whole because we all know all of them are not like that but yet theres a small few who dont care or even acknowledge that little fact one lady on here stated black men are not participating enough to do so and im telling her and everyone they are but theyre numbers are so freakin low the number of men who are willing to participate is staggering and it is funny how they admit they fear they will get rejected just by showing a face a huge exaggeration i feel but i cant speak on ones feelings internally so accurately
2384	1	she definitely betrayed her but i dont think she did it for herself i think they still mostly had that mentality of serving their masters they hadnt been free for very long and it is difficult to shake off a lifetime of abuse and subjugation especially when the house workers were around the owners  the majority of the time unlike the field workers who were able to detach themselves a bit more
2385	1	why do some of you insist on playing stupid like this you knew exactly what she meant
2386	1	i worked for 2 years in a furniture store and it  shocked me how  many women would just steal the incense and fragrances those items ended up being the only things that were security tagged and there were luxury furnishings and seasonal decorations easily triple the value that werent tagged and were never recorded as stolen
2387	1	i feel you this group is for only dsbw though maybe a general black ladies forum one day it is hard to feel secure on reddit the demographic is over 90 nonblack
2388	1	lol yeah they are weird cant deny that
2389	1	sorry i shouldve explained nd means neurodivergent  so anyone of an uncommon neurotype this could mean people who suffer from mental illnessdisabilities etc
2390	1	i do and was clear about that i have no issue with large churches megachurches are by and large a problem and a mark on the religion in multiple ways even if you might like yours i believe that the larger a church gets the better chance they have of running afoul of the true purpose of christianity mostly because money power and capitalism are real temptations i also believe that the larger a church gets the more leaders need to be held to account for those exact reasons
2391	1	i use to find asian men very attractive and i loved me some kpop and dramas until i saw my baby in blackface for a commercial nothing has been the same since
2392	1	good luck with brexit im hoping you land on your feet
2393	1	me too thank you
2394	1	whoa what did this person say ive never seen so many downvotes in this sub
2395	1	let us know what you think
2396	1	youre correct the correct term to use is sex gtalso i am not placing said oppressive men as a separate social classi didnt say you said that i just asked you a question i didnt take your words and twisted them i used them to ask a q to see your view point gtif a black man is a good man he will not be phased when we criticize men as a social classhe will and is phased when you have women categorizing him as a whole
2397	1	it could be my latex allergy but the fact that there were 3 very clear lesions they were localized only around my vaginal opening my lymph nodes were also inflamed and i didnt have any irritation in my mouth leads me to believe it is not an allergic reaction but there is a small chance it could be that i have delayed reactions and the irritation began a couple days after i last had sex the good thing is the guy is going to get tested too he hasnt been tested in many years and could have been carrying it without symptoms and passed it to me so well see
2398	1	that still brings up the situation where a nonblack person can use nigga if the people around them are comfortable like other nonblack people or a black person who doesnt care i find that problematic is it ok to say it if the person who is not comfortable wasnt there but then found out a later found out
2399	1	jesus fucking christ
2400	1	the only problem is that the mediapublic doesnt seem to let things go depending on the person and infraction

2402	1	i love to challenge the i dont see race people by asking them would they color obama and bill clinton with the same crayon

2406	1	agreed re serena her hbo documentary series actually made me like her lessbut her mans more
2407	1	either that or ignore until he starts acting crazy and use the screenshots to get him kicked off the site
2408	1	she killed her debut role in 12 years a slave i still think about how that character made me feel
2409	1	thank you so much for fighting this
2410	1	youre right i didnt even think about that in my mind i was just hoping for some opinions on if im overthinking this or something but wow thank you for making me see it from the other side i hope i didnt offend anybody
2411	1	gti find it confusing why the leaders of such churches would be conspicuous consumersit is because theyre hypocrites who dont practice what they preach
2412	1	there is nothing defensive about my response but youre clearly on the offense here funny how you never pull this shit in bf btw the majority of mods are black women we dont all come from one place or look one way and yes mods here do have black sos it is fucking obvious if you actually look there are like 50 other black subs you can settle in to but this sub is not your punching bag if you wanna be an asshole do it elsewhere if there is a dark skinned nonamerican woman who would like to mod here hit us up in modmail
2413	1	i cry i dont mean to cry it works i dont do it on purposein an argument with significant other i win if i crycobbler says he cannot fix my shoes if i cry hell try to do it and succeedshoe store doesnt have my size cry and theyll find my size for mebody shop says they cannot  do a repair any better cry and i get 50 off what they did accomplishpulled over crying could be dangerous here and i tried not to but apparently i had a tail light out and a couple things else wrong i got a ticket for only one of them and an aww you remind me of my wife  i also once got lets go to the autoparts shop and ill show you how to fix iti guess it works because i really dont do it on purpose it backfires because people think they can hug me if i cry especially in a retail environmentim 510 and used to bodybuild so i dont know what it is it seems to be men of all ethnic groups too maybe men are low key prepared to deal with tears by acquiescencing at least when they arent committing a crime that could be a factor
2414	1	i didnt think you were writing the newsletter i meant could you share the newsletter as a resource
2415	1	yeah she didnt like i wanted to go natural so she had me going with her to a hair appointment where they tried to relax me without my consent i washed my hair beforehand so they couldnt and she was pretty much done with me as an employee after that this sounds crazy looking back lol
2416	1	for me personally 4c they look like shit and dont work an hour after the wash and go no matter what ive done to it or what products ive used it looks terrible even if it looked slightly good at first no thanks
2417	1	same it just adds to the many reasons i dont want kids
2418	1	nah i know it is not a black issue im not saying it is exclusive to black people just that some particular types of black people have done this to me whereas i havent dealt with this sort of touchiness from people of other races and not to that level usually my problems are indeed with white girls trying to touch my hair and occasionally the asian girl who is from a visiting country my asianamerican friends have never done this shit just the foreigners who dont know yet not to do that to people and one latina i know in her culture though girls only touch their friend is hair and her and i are friends i let it slide once onlyi love my people but i dont like getting betrayed like that
2419	1	what about the timing couldve been better im curious because for us theres literally nothing that being engaged changes except me finally feeling like i did it we live together we split everything except the rent marriage on the other hand has to wait a few years because of his job and we discussed that im totally okay with thatthis is the first relationship where i havent pushed things along before hes ready for them i had a habit of doing that because ive always really wanted to be married like rushing i love yous and living together this is the first normal paced relationship ive been in ive never brought up engagement or anything because i wanted it to be his choice now that hes mentioned it multiple times im chomping at the bit wondering what is taking so long i want him to do it because all through school i asked guys to date me or to even notice me and it didnt happen i took the initiative because no one took it with me im tired of that i want to be claimed for once
2420	1	these are three of my favorite foods and i feel sorry for you
2421	1	asking whether or not something benefits black men is the subject of black men not family and certainly not black women
2422	1	as i said to someone elsegt uhh we dont have that type of relationship its an emotionally abusive household and speaking up is just going to go badly for me so id rather not
2423	1	in my opinion it doesnt it is just more explaining to try and soften the bs oh the black man isnt really racist it is just white supremacy none of it matters they dont like black women point blankand no since ive been here anytime someone mentions a racist nb male it is just met with hostility like it should be and the person is told oh so nicely that it is her fault or the entire thing is just usually dismissedbut sure let is continue to discuss why black males dislike black women like we havent already or like why it even mattersand again they arent discussing this we shouldnt either there is plenty of males that like black women for various reasons focus on them
2424	1	lol it definitely is not and the last thing this sub needswants is another influx of my non black bf called me a porch monkey while his family threw bananas at me should i leave him type posts
2425	1	yeah it is super offensive
2426	1	exactly end thread lol
2427	1	and thanks no smoke requested
2428	1	gt like obviously you understand the purpose of needing exclusive spaces because youre herethey can still have their own exclusive space without being at the mercy of a woman who deems you dark or even black enough gtto me you sound like white people who argue that racism is over and that if black people want to get ahead in society we need to stop acting like victims and pull ourselves up by our bootstrapsyoure talking to someone who grew up in a predominantly white society and was never fully confident in her own skin i dont know how it sounds like im telling you to pull yourself up by your bootstraps you are saying that an exclusive space for dark skinned women is good im saying i agree with you however i dont agree with the method of making it exclusive how does what i say even remotely sound like saying racism is over i know firsthand that it is far from over i never even said colorism wasnt a big deal i already know this gtin my experience theres no way of getting through to people like that so im not going to waste my energyin your experience of what meeting 2 3 people if you feel you have limited energy then quit your day job if you care about energy so much
2429	1	gt however when i really sit down with cognitive distortion and see if im going any them when analyzing a situation i see some truth to the positive patty horseshit and i dont think there is anything wrong with this i think it is something we need to get better at or actually find our own version of my issue is when there is one or two posts like thisgtbut i have seen the post along the lines of soandso implied black women are ________ and followup discussion that has is usually filtering catastrophizing personalizing and stating  ishould statements about soandso those are distortions even feeling undesirable is technically a distortion cause that involves filtering out your positive qualities and focusing on the negativeand it then gets 1 painted a blanket problem and 2 something that is somehow the root cause of the majority of our problems the extremely popular pinned post right now is about black being beautiful and ive regularly seen posts praising black professionals artists encouraging financial literacy and education for months now there is even a weekly positivity post i see more of that type of post and more positive response than anything related to stereotypes it is completely possible to encourage people to leave off negative thinking processes without unfairly suggesting an issue is common or implying that if we all just fixed that our problems will turn around the infrequency of the posts is pretty strong proof that the majority of us simply dont deal with with internalizing negativity at that leveland yet we still have issues with racism the connection isnt as clean as op seems to want to paint it i can see how op possibly wasnt clear all her personal examples make me suspicious though but i also think she was feeding off of and into a stereotype herself that shouldnt go left unchecked
2430	1	the problem lies in that my now late father and my grandfather both attempted to find out more of my family is history by going to jackson back in the 90 is to find information only getting lost along the way  the closest thing we had as a clue is that my older brother father and grandfather share the same first name as my grandfather is father and his before yes 5 confirmed generations of the same first and last name  now this was before ancestrydna so attempts at doing this again have been difficult mostly because he is in 90 is were all separated by time and distance  i would love to get at least a record of what his dna ancestry is but i still need to find the time
2431	1	i wholeheartedly agree
2432	1	your post historyloli hope youre a troll and not just a vile person
2433	1	yeah that is fair i wouldnt necessarily put him on the same level as the pimp though
2434	1	and asians are even on their side too
2435	1	thank youi hate linkedin too but i cant lie it is been really helpful really easy to have all my connections in one place
2436	1	ok just fucking ughim multiracial predominantly hispanic and black and the colorism and racism in my own damn extended family is astounding and incredibly disappointing i overheard an aunt on my father is side referring to norteños as peasants and she wasnt trying to be remotely malicious she just actually thought that it was acceptable to say shit like that i never heard anything racist towards black people but i wonder if it was because they didnt feel that way or if my dad would have kicked their ass if they ever said anything hint it is the latter so many of my latinx classmates in high school were overtly bigoted towards black people and honestly vice versa it was ugly at my school just a bucket of crabs trying to elevate themselves by pulling everybody else down
2437	1	i am op lolim on a wait list for a black therapist in february so well see what happens the therapist im seeing now is queer and so am i and its been helpful in that sense the black therapist is straight so i dont think theres any winning in that situationbecause of the racial and homophobic trauma ive been through i find it hard to trust straight people or other poc which doesnt feel so healthy for me no therapist will have lived thru my experience so at some point it seems like ill have to take a deep breath and just trust its hard im not in usa so unfortunately there arent many black therapists and the ones that are available are costlyive decided to continue seeing the korean therapist for the time being because i dont know if its right to discredit her based on her people you know shes antioppressive so as long as shes educating herself on these issues and shes not shown me a real reason not to trust her yetdoes that sound like a good ideathank you for your insight it feels so good to come on this subreddit and yall to people who can relate to me
2438	1	wow a relaxer every 2 wks thats a bit much nonetheless initial relaxer always last about a week if the person is wrapping their hair up at night usually after a week or so probably would then need a wash and style againalso those women you see with their hair looking great 365 probably spend 100s a month black hair is so much to take care of does she do her own hair
2439	1	they dont post both places they lurk here and post there i dont know why they do
2440	1	ohh well maybe thats best i know i dont know you but you seem like a very mature person to have such a positive outlook towards it
2441	1	i just think it is crazy the only white women i find attractive are gwen stefani maggie off the walking dead and marilyn monroe i dont see why so many men of so many different races prefer basic blonde hair stick women lol i cant say it makes me mad as much as it baffles me lol
2442	1	when rshoplifting existed it was basically just white people using their privilege to easily steal shit had no shame im so glad that sub got shut down
2443	1	it is so aggravating
2444	1	youre welcome
2445	1	gtwhat is funny is this rarely happens with white menthis op could have had tons of bad experiences with white men but i doubt she would generalize them this is falseblack women deal with sexism and racism simultaneously from with white menand we are quite aware of bothgtthere are black men that act the way op described there are tons do notbut how do you know there are tons of black men who do not act in the way op describedop has probably dated tons of black men as have many of black women on this sub and their mothers aunt is grandmothers great aunt is etc you however unless you are not heterosexual have not dated or had to deal with black men romanticallyso how can the generalization be invalid statistics show that black women date outside their race significantly less than black menif you read the comments on this thread and the many just like it you will see similar posts just like ops so clearlythere arent a ton of black men who dont act the way op described
2446	1	please go do that shit and leave this sub alone
2447	1	yes congrats
2448	1	i love that one its refreshing just hearing her be her unfiltered self
2449	1	some parts of new england are yes and certain citiestowns in the greater boston area also yes we also have tons of immigrants which i lovegrowing up here as a first generation american almost all my friends were also first gen americans or immigrants themselves so i didnt really experience much racism during my formative yearsbut the population has changed a lot in the past 10ish years and it is now become something i encounter  i dont feel unsafe at all but unwelcome and discounted so i mock people silently p it cheers me up and keeps me from walking around woundedrealllllly hoping all that answered your question hah
2450	1	why i dont know her so
2451	1	i really think the way were portrayed in the media and social media is not helping that like yes instathots make your money i am not mad at you but people need to realize they have many dimensions not just their looks and realize there are many other kinds of black women who also have many interests and ideas were more than our bodies
2452	1	yeah i see this as light ignorance not so much racism white women of course would only go for what matches their hair type i didnt know horse hair was a thing it kinda works both ways in this case
2453	1	and is filing a lawsuit not an option
2454	1	i have a station just for them
2455	1	yep eyes on the prize use the money and pick his brain for career tips dont let the networking get messy though use him for his contacts but convert them to being your contacts so he cant blackball you and keep the feelings out of it play but dont get played and be safe cuz who knows who all he got his junk in
2456	1	i just hopped on twitter and looked at trending this discussion is actually trending with 17k tweets which is unbelievable it was
2457	1	gt age aint nothin but a numberlol thanksgt i might have to check out fever raythe sister half of the band it was a brother and sister karin dreijer does a seriously creepy and depressing song called still light that you may or may not want to listen to as well  i dont know if it is just her or her and others who form the band called the knife that is the name the song is under
2458	1	omg that sounds so amazing since you have brought up networking opportunities im actually planning on collaborating with alumni or staffprofessors that can discuss pathways if this isnt possible i want to be able to get current university students to mentor the first year students sort of like a buddy system i will take the resumeprofessional side on board as well could be useful having those workshops and thank you so much for the kind words ive honestly been thinking about this for the past 3 years so its really nice to see this come to life
2459	1	i understand that it isnt fusion but they cant dismiss the interpretation because the parallel is too strong similar to how maybe a writer doesnt realize they did something with racial or gender coding they made a thing that brings together people that some see as something casual and addicting others see as personal and should only be done with certain people that can also be done because it can run the risk of corrupting you with a notstd if you do it with a corrupted gemthe writers can explicitly say that it doesnt represent that but theyre the ones that wrote this without realizing what theyre writing and i think that is a common issue the show has they dont realize the implications of half of what theyre putting downi get that steven and connie didnt just have sex on screen because underage kids sex is all kinds of no but i guess the writers have to do better than say it wasnt this thing when theyre the ones who opened that can of worms to begin with it is similar to all the people in michael bay films people read as gayit is still there from the writing even if it was unintentional that and this is the same kids show that directly references slavery war genocide what might as well be gem nazism among other thingsso i think the show is too far in to excuse itself with being for kidsbismuth is great but what bugs me was that steven looked so uncomfortable over them fighting when he literally fights all the time and theyve trained all the time toothe moment the black woman wants to fight the diamonds knowing she made a weapon that will spare the lives of any innocents since she was a former slave herself suddenly violence is bad
2460	1	because men are trash and also racist there is no reasoning for it hun its up to you if you think they are telling the truth and if they are they need to prove it too you i am just saying what i know
2461	1	haha i think its because people are unsure what black factually means whether it is good or bad as in the case with your colleague and to whom it applies
2462	1	for real worlds apart and we can all still connect nobody in my immediate family celebrates so im just going to spend the days being extra mindful and embody an aura of pure blacknesshappy cake day
2463	1	lmfao yesssss backyard bill
2464	1	haha i dont move either unless ya speak up if you dont say anything im just gonna be there longer until you leave or say excuse meit tears my nerves up when people do this when im waiting in line its like they only want to walk across the line in front of me
2465	1	i think a lot of people see or treat love and marriage as two different things i get the logic and honestly that is how it is worked for forever the emotional expectations are relatively newif were being honest almost nobody checks to see if women are loved and cared for or not even especially in marriage were praised for being good sacrificial wives and seldom for choosing or being with a partner that enhances our lives or who we work well with some people are just really driven by that social feedback it makes sense at a certain leveli also think marriage is one of the few things women feel generally comfortable asking for in a relationship
2466	1	right like im tying to geek out about my new videogame and have a real conversation while buddy over here fetishizing me come on
2467	1	yeah high school is hard enough already and i think it is more fundamental in shaping who most of us are as adults than people commonly acknowledge for girls especially it is a time when a lot of mental health and self esteem issues can start to really manifest i know that is where my idea of where i fit socially started to cement but it is also where i did a lot of development academically especially how i saw myself as a student and how i viewed equity in the world i dealt with enough racist teachers at my public school but since it wasnt majority white it didnt feel like me against the world it just felt like a couple of racist assholes among others i cant imagine what i would have gone through if id been in a private predominately white school i look back at some of the early stage mean girls from my middle school and shudder to think what they grew into that is really messed up about your brother i had a couple of male family members who went through private school too and let is just say only one made it out kind of ok the other ended up in jail his self esteem is still really rocky too i personally wouldnt send my children to that kind of high school theyre designed not to be a realistic reflection of what the world is white people send their children to those environments specifically for that reason and the fact that they funnel into similar social groups and spaces i imagine it is much harder to change course after that point
2468	1	my definition of middle class is making more than 60000 run of the mill corporate job or business owner whose products are resonating in their local market spaceon a side note i seldom hear lower class in reference to income it is usually only in reference to behaviortoddler dies in hot car while mom shops inside mall

2472	1	ooooh minicomic sounds dope
2473	1	i think it was good that you didnt leave her alone with him i would honestly never leave my friend drunk or high with a man tbh but those situations can get scary i honestly wouldnt know how to defend myself against a bigger aggressive man other than like pepper spray you seem like a great person
2474	1	thanks so much
2475	1	you dont have to ban people for it though you can just upvote and downvote
2476	1	i really find this pov interesting yoitsyogirl and i think more women should consider that being the case as to not have their ego feel too bruised or their time too wasted leftblanewe always here the hallmarknarrative that sometimes we are in people is lives to make them better some people are in your life for a reason and some for a season etc and that some women groom pun intended their man for the next person he is supposed to be with however no matter how true even that logic can still be damaging or frustrating when going through the motions in real time ampx200bbut reality is in situations like these it really could more or less be out of desperation and not so much love not that i wish that on any person if there is one thing ive learned about men is that contrary to popular belief they do not like being alone they might like acting single but they do not like being alone
2477	1	gtall i can hear is pull yourself up by the bootstrapsthat is because that is all it is it is scary how many upvotes that comment got especially when it sounds like it could come from your average racist trump supporter that is probably who is doing the voting though
2478	1	convince to make a snapchat for her comedy an acquaintance was obsessed with using a snapchat filter that made her voice high pitched and called her alter ego fluff i almost never have the sound on for my snapchat so i watched them and eventually she gave up the alter ego other than that lowkey fight whichever family member friend that is convincing her that shes funny
2479	1	sign up for the mailing list theyll send you a coupon off
2480	1	she got into yale
2481	1	and none of that says tired of doing something is code for telling other people not to do it and has something to do with their moralsnice try though
2482	1	wait ive noticed the discussion thread but not much discussing actually happens from what ive seen people just comment what they have to say and people upvote a lot its not much of adding to most of the comments if that makes sensei havent seen the relationship one ill check that out though thanks
2483	1	i like to follow various subs from different demographic groups as well as different cities far from where i live gives me a good perspective on other people is views for example ive been following rbrisbane even though i live nowhere near australia  just been fun seeing what politics and news is going on elsewhere in the worldtypically i dont participate ive broken the rule a few times as in this case since i thought i could contribute on the issue but when i do i make sure i at least announce myself
2484	1	oh shoot  thanks
2485	1	hows xavier i think my boyfriend has that on his list and thats what i was thinking with howard just being in the political atmosphere but i am very interested in the all girl environment with spelman its just so much more expensive and i doubt ill get much aid from them
2486	1	you can also explain to your family that you want to stop celebrating it
2487	1	exactly
2488	1	curious about dating and how the clubs were did you get hit up a lot how do they tend to flirt as opposed to here and did you go on any dates
2489	1	omg thats crazy its almost like we definitely feel pain the same way other people do i dont know why but i feel the need to not verbalize my pain or downplay it something has to hurt a ton for my to complain about it im glad the dentist fixed the program and your visit was free
2490	1	back foul demon we are godly here lol
2491	1	tell me when you find them
2492	1	nah cardi doesnt strike me as the type to lie and finesse for publicity she is too raw for all that it is definitely real and i hope she doesnt go back to him
2493	1	when did i say you couldnt im saying theyre still allowed to exist as much as they want because not all black people are the same if a black female decided thats trump is the best president america has ever had even if i dont agree with her at all shes entitled to her opinion especially as a black person we arent all the same and its harmful to expect us to all be the same
2494	1	i guess
2495	1	same i love my brown and hate looking washed out in winter time
2496	1	you seem much more upset than i can understand
2497	1	gtit sounds like the trauma you experienced is causing you to associate those feelings and distress with an entire group of people i think you should speak with a therapistnot an entire group just some people within that particular group i know some dont do that but ive noticed plenty have it is seriously annoyinggti also think you should work on your assertiveness you need to be able to speak up and establish boundaries with people so that you dont feel taken advantage of in social or work situationsi think youre definitely right about that part what also adds to it is the fact that i struggle to say anything at the moment i end up easily triggered by the thought of it later on
2498	1	is it temporary if it is the majority of the time when does a wig go from protective style to just literally the only style one wears
2499	1	throwing her attempt to travel in her face was the last straw he is been late other times and would get caught up and she wouldnt say anything but in all honesty he makes 50k a yr lives with his momma and has almost no bills so all his excuses are moot she has filed the paperwork in the past when he called off their wedding after she bought the dress of course butttt they got back together after that until she finally realized that this back and forth of 15 years was not going to come to a proper ending
2500	1	his apology post is bullshit when he also talks about made up rage and pair that with the fact that these werent isolated incidents
2501	1	gtpersonally  i just feel like youtubers have been recently dictating what is real black so seeing this forum with it is test triggered me again as my family is a range of skin tones and were all black since as far as i can telli understand what youre saying gatekeeping has beencan be problematic as well there is definitely no easy solution
2502	1	i had to stop watching his shows a while back it is a minstrel show turned on its head eww
2503	1	i understand your perspective as well lord knows my first wig my first dye job my first sew in my first box braids my first braid out my first faux locs etc were far from the best with that being said though what you consider cute could be what i consider a mess and vice versa i also have thin hair and think wash and go is look cuter on people with thick hairdifferent strokes for different folks
2504	1	are bookish and black mutually exclusive  i think that mentality pretty much sums up the problem black people hate the notion of being black because all the negative imagery that go along with it  couldnt somebody find her language damaging because she is insinuating that being black isnt being bookish   im not from los angeles so i dont know  im from harlem  is there not a culture of learned black people in los angeles  i  was reading all the time and my parents put me in all types of math geology clubs   there were a lot of west indian indians africans in these clubs too  white parents didnt force their kids into nerdy school events the way immigrant parents did   it could be a los angeles thing
2505	1	if youre not a pokémon a person i dont know it looked like a pretty immersive experience it takes a lot to get me to watch somebody else play a video game for two hours
2506	1	asking questions is definitely the best route your response is spot on no kid wants to be told how to feel especially when they dont understand it if you ask enough questions shell start to understand that she can question things in general and it wont take long before she realizes who is in the wrong its also okay for kids to be upset when they dont understand the situation fully it doesnt mean you have to give all the details to set the record straight just let her have her feelings and be understanding while helping her remain respectful
2507	1	you played right into my hands kaiba how dare you insult my familygirl was done with his shit even the villain just assumed she would win and points out ishizu hasnt lost her touch i always knew she had a darker side
2508	1	did you not read my response the title is literally connected to what i wrote come on seriously go read it again take a moment to digest the words instead of being so unnecessarily argumentative
2509	1	you said you didnt see where anyone was trashing black men im saying having the title of your post be im tired of black men because of a tweet by some dude on twitter that seems like a joke and a tinder profile is definitely trashing black men
2510	1	im afraid of being like my parents and getting angry all the time
2511	1	i was born in 96 so i was 34 years old that year i dont like street harassment and im just going by stories of what i hear from other black women i do like italian food though and would like to see milan rome and maybe naples this is cynthia baileyhttpswwwgooglecomsearchqcynthiabaileyamprlz1c1chfx_enus807us807ampsourcelnmsamptbmischampsaxampved0ahukewjrkup50otfahviqq0khfb5bmqq_auidygc btw
2512	1	wtf u trynna say
2513	1	gtactually there is plenty of data showing that the assumptions are because theyre white to the point where it is illegal in the us for realtors to say stuff like this neighborhood has good schools because it is well documented that that is code for black people dont live hereshow me that data you cant complain that black schools are not getting enough funding and then get mad when people dont want to send their kids to those schools even if i dont get your point you were the one making a blanket statement without any nuance that is bound to create misunderstandinggtsaying that good schools can be white is different that acting like white schools are good good schools can also be blackin this society white schools are the good ones at least usually no one is denying good schools can be black but youre acting like there is enough of them 80 of this country is white there is not going to be enough room for good black schools which is a problem african americans are trying to fix you cant have it both ways it is not like there is necessarily a good black school down the road gtim talking explicitly about black people who will move into proven mediocre white school districts for good schools but would never consider the often cheaper good black private option in a black neighborhoodswell the original op worded what you said differently plus not everyone wants to pay for a private school that will increase their tuition every year even financial aid can only do so much if both schools were public schools and the black one was better that would be different maybe the mediocre white school has a better bussing system or better after school activities plus your situation is a very special situation and not something that usually happens to families considering the demographics and history in the us
2514	1	alright i understand your viewpoint and that makes sense apologies
2515	1	i feel like part of the reason women look for emotional connection and feel used otherwise is because of how normalized it is for men to be complete trash in bed if women could reasonably expect an orgasm in a casual encounter it would be less upsetting to be propositioned but anyway black men dont understand because they often dont do empathy they expect it but refuse to give it
2516	1	gtso what is this post suppose to do invalidate the other poster  gt  gtwhy cant be respect both experiences without trying to shit on black women for head pats from black menwill the same energy be kept if there is a post venting about black women posted in rblackfellas they would only be talking about their personal individual experiences after all
2517	1	write it off if you want but nothing youve posted here is anything an ally would do
2518	1	you know what women who are adamant about their sexual satisfaction are usually called bitches and hoes again this is societal women didnt actively outsource their sexual pleasure this is not a conscious individual decision made in isolation with little to no consequences this is the result of living in a society where women have been treated as property for centuries many of the original control mechanisms have yet to be fully dismantled the negative societal repercussions for women who stand up for themselves are still very much in place i will never in life forget the guy who legitimately fixed his mouth to tell me i didnt need to come every time we had sex women speaking up means nothing if men feel they dont have to listen yes we could all get vibrators and leave men high and dry but that is not a functional solution the solution is for men to own their own inadequacies instead of playing the you let me do it game
2519	1	you should take your pathetic arse out of my thread thanks
2520	1	that sounds very interesting
2521	1	yeah i do it took me some practice to get it done like this but ive finally got it to where i can make it at least somewhat decent lol
2522	1	that is who i main i never wanted to be a lucio main but no one ever picked healer
2523	1	by creating and maintaining them ourselves
2524	1	i like men of all races actually
2525	1	thanks
2526	1	yeah but i saw it as the black guys in the movie were heroes meanwhile you got crazy ass white people tryna murder everybody i think they did it as good as they could
2527	1	she did just put a song out with tekashi and kanye sis is canceling herself at this point
2528	1	gt our hair is not problematic stop the self hate if you have been dealing without your own natural hair since childhood washing twisting and throwing it into a bun should be a cake walkum excuse me where did you get the idea that i think of our hair as problematic i dont know about you but i love my black hair
2529	1	it is not in a negative light it is a whole other thing of weirdness basically wishing they had the balls to swear off asian women
2530	1	what exactly is your point i made 20 an hr as in intern nine years ago theyre interns not volunteers you dense cabbage
2531	1	exactly you cant just say that and then not explain
2532	1	gtim so confused when did i say i went to meet his familyi read it wrong gtive been with him for 6 years this isnt the first time his friend and i have had discussions discussions relating to black people or in general if you had these topics relating to this subject and his views havent changed its pointless in debating with him the moral of my comment is dont waste ya time if he has that weird desire just let him be in his corner
2533	1	i think people need to realize that even priests are not morally perfect or superior they are just trained as though they are they have higher standards placed on them and rightfully so so its only normal that people expect more from them but they are not a substitute for god and we should not treat them like one someone should not become a pastor or priest if they cant fulfill the necessary requirements and i dont want to sound like i am justifying a priest living a life of sin just because they are humans however they are people and they should be allowed to make mistakes provided that they repent for them and undergo the necessary consequences and provided that they do not commit those and other mistakes again especially because of their presumed integrity and standards that they must follow at their position  again a priest should not be a priest if they are prone to making those mistakes but if they do it doesnt mean they are beyond redemption they should also not abuse their authority to silence people who question their actions and motives as that is a form of pride with your example of the priests the catholic churchs actions regarding the punishment of priests has been controversial so thats a whole different issue
2534	1	dont waste a second of your life worrying about trash written by cretins on the internet
2535	1	hell tell me im the one and well have so much fun
2536	1	gt quasifetishistic anthropological research fodderthis phrase is the perfect encapsulation of how it feels they watch us like zoo animals ampx200b
2537	1	even so as a representative of his church it is inappropriate for him to purchase that gift you could be right that is it is a gift to say im sorry but it is still wrong he has no business buying her that car book deal or not
2538	1	how do you know that they are exaggerated there are so many statistics to back this upalso our different location age etc and other intersections all affect our experiences
2539	1	wellintentioned for sure but the world would be a better place for whom  for reckless people who treat their friends like cannon fodder  certainly not for black women  the world would be a better place when we exercise sensible compassion for others tempered with radical compassion for ourselves  the only thing that is simple is how dangerously this couldve turned out for the opeta it is important not to confuse concern with criticism i absolutely understand op is instincts but i unapologetically advocate for women and black women in particular to center themselves  i would be remiss not to encourage reflection
2540	1	yeah everyone in the room kinda went quiet after she said that
2541	1	i just imagined a 15 year old version of me telling the kids at school that i listen to taylor swift looool
2542	1	thank you and congratulations again
2543	1	maybe because you dont want to date a racist black man just a thought
2544	1	its not it is more gotchya journalism similar to when kendall jenner was wearing an afro this divide and concur shit is pure evil
2545	1	i had the exact same epiphany my first few days on reddit swindled again
2546	1	gt i dont know what im doing id love help haha yea  exactly this is most good parents who just want to do right by their kids
2547	1	yes indeed
2548	1	me too i was about to defend the elder scrolls series
2549	1	period
2550	1	thank you too many of my female relatives have the same story i fully intend for the generational curses in this family to end with me
2551	1	you just said a lot people wanna make it so hard for us to transcend our bodies
2552	1	why are they so creepy i thought this was a thread for black women lol the stalking gets so real with them sometimes
2553	1	good point sounds terrible though  but maybe doable for a little while
2554	1	nah a colorist black man wrote it it was their wet dream
2555	1	i guess so but i still dont think its anyone is business no one ever asks my white friends why they bleach dye and do all sorts of crazy things to their hair so im not really sure why relaxing my hair is a big deal to someone ive only met a handful of times
2556	1	they assumed it because theyre lazy in their thinking
2557	1	yea what does it mean
2558	1	being offensive is not enough reason to apologize oh okay
2559	1	it does not compute butthat is just the dying fear sounds of those old white men
2560	1	i just downloaded it and matched with two people we will see what happens
2561	1	congratulations on dumping the dead weight  in a way i got rid of one myself i dont do silent treatment also kudos for taking your stuff back even though youre not here yet welcome from a unicorn austinite at that we still exist but were hard to find
2562	1	charlamagne proclaims to be a faithful husband but yet he preys on the ignorance of others who follow him with that black men dont cheat bullshit its become a mantra of his these days and clearly his sheeple are taking it to heart its propaganda its a pass to continue to being _not shit_
2563	1	honestly
2564	1	basing it off lifestyle is dangerous because again thats how so many of the people i know who are in the top 1 think theyre middle class because they technically struggle too and theyre constantly surrounded by people with that same lifestyle its necessary to have defined borders when it comes to income inequality or else we cant have a conversation at all
2565	1	alright well if shes choosing not to interfere and hasnt for 65 years what makes you think she will all of a sudden i get where youre coming from but our future right now is dependant on brexit deals not whether the queen will dissolve parliament she wont her being able to or not is irrelevant because she wouldnt do it never im not a royalist or anything like that im just not bothered about them and there are more important issues in the country right now knife crime in the capital acid attacks in the capital the grenfell tragedy and of course brexit aka were fucked
2566	1	gtbecause theyre raised with it even women have expectations of men that are founded in hypermasculinity no one is exempt and they need to take responsibility that is a huge statement you have there any sources that has been conducted by us it least all men arent raised with that and what type of homesettings are these found in better yet if you dont feel like showing me anything is there any particular words i should take up on my own gtthis isnt new or unique to black women eitheri didnt say it was new or unique our name isnt dragged by the dirt consistantly and is being more recognized then any other political issues besides blmgtawareness falls on older men who are awarelike the ones who think they dont want to be lumped in with the others that is why i said they are trying to spread it the word did you not read the part i said theyre posts their groups their speeches books opinions are instantly being shut down hell im talking about the good men here and my post is being shut down by asking i dont agree from taking away all the hard work we accomplished im just asking do we support or willedwilling to add them ongtthe ones who arent like the rest need to step up and do the work just like we had to instead of expecting black women to pick up after them there is not one thing in this area black women have done that black men cant do too again did you read the part where i said they are working but how can they get recognition with so much going on already females are piling up into these groups then the men themselves bc it is a low population of black men already which is why i provided some links that support my views and thought and you have some smaller groups 515 men vs thousands of us  who just work in silence bc theyve been rejected for so many times and it isnt bc of how they speak or approach either you literally have women that just degrade them and not listen when they listenunderstand us these men seriously dont have a chance their content isnt being shared enough and it is not too many of the good ones we have improvements that not even white people are comfortable with and im proud of that the numbers and those who dedicated are the ones who will make it with time
2567	1	fair enough but i meant our communities as a whole beyond reddit but then again i know the disagreements amongst us do not represent all of us and vice versa
2568	1	im only bringing white feminism up bc that was what inspired me to ask the question i didnt have a few meetings i had a few perspectives on how they operate gtyou dont know what theyre doing or why theyre bringing men in white women are notorious for putting on a front and using any and everybody to boost their imageagain offended theyre bringing in men for numbers they are trying to collect us all for their own rights their forefathers didnt allow them to do youre testing my intelligence pertaining and even assume a lot stop it because im not ignorant to the white race and their politics groups gtim not really sure why you feel you need a white perspective on this issue especially since weve been doing this longer than they have in a much more difficult environment on this issue i didnt need a white perspective for black feminism i wanted a perspective that provoked me to ask a q another assumption ive known we done it longer i just dont know the details gtwhat is offensive is being compared to them at all when there is absolutely no reason to even mention them in a discussion of how black women and men interact i didnt compare i gave an opinion and a view of what i saw in their community which once again lead me to ask questions what do we do with our men in this movement i mentioned them on one thing only hey guys i notice white women take men in you assumed based off that im comparing  compare estimate measure or note the similarity or dissimilarity betweeni didnt put any type of similarity or dissimilarity i just stated what i noticed and what lead this topic then immediately went in us i didnt say anything of the sort white women and men does this black women dont and if i did good googily moogily my apologies because my approach wasnt intended to compare but just give a brief statement of what went through my head to ask the q
2569	1	gtthis is not a nice piece of jewelry not even a very nice one it is a very expensive and ostentatious carit is only relevant because we know the price if i see a pastor drive up in an expensive car i dont assume he spent 200k on it there is also the possibility that he got a cheap model an older car a car at a good price etc so that is my point pastors are not incapable of sound financial decisions like getting 100 boots for 20 like i do or a 50000 for 10000 or whatever the average price of a car is gta lamborghini isnt even close to living like a regular person you cant even say gray fudged the line he blew right past it and bragged about it if a pastor is doing that theyre wrong and need to be looking at jesus evaluating their career decisions and really worried about being judged twice as strictly because of their choice to become teachersi agree they need to worry about being judged and he shouldnt have bragged about it that is not cool i agree completely however my point is that you shouldnt be hyperjudgmental of leaders there is a balance and it goes both ways you sound like youre trying to overcompensate for the greed of the church but in doing that you misrepresent everything the church stands for and you even take bible verses out of context jesus never said a servant of god could not have jewelry or a car gtyoure not being judgemental enough were supposed to hold each other to account vs people outside the churchi absolutely am being judgmental enough i never said i condone what this pastor did but i feel youre going to extremes and are twisting the actual mission of a pastor gtyou should look at both you can do good and be exploitative and a poor leader at the same time the very worst most abusive sexual assaulting financially crooked ministers out here did good on the sidenever said you couldnt yes it is possible to be exploitative and do good but you cant just judge the good he is doing just by this one incident if he buys a mansion and a yacht after this then yeah okay but this is just an isolated incident as far as we know he doesnt buy lamborghinis regularly gtbecause our religion is in a mess and we have to step up and hold leaders and each other to account before we end up like white evangelicals that is the whole point of matthew 513the problem is youre being hyperjudgemental and think a reddit post is going to stop christianity from becoming like white evangelicalism you shut me down when i said not all christians are a monolith as well we can criticize pastors but we can also hold ourselves accountable when being judgmentalgtif a middle class mom makes a vow to be a leader and servant of god she gets held to that standard too so you should be questioning her tooanyone regardless of their position unless theyre a monk that makes specific vows to not have any unnecessary material posessions can have jewelry and a car that is my point i question you if you think pastors cant have jewelry and a car that does not go against biblical teaching
2570	1	youre so true about building a confident self identity i feel better about myself knowing black people have invented some important things in history plus we have people like ryan coogler and jordan peele i feel as a black man i can get into the film industry
2571	1	thank you for sharing this is amazing saturn return is such an intense time and i feel like to the outside observer it can look like youre making a very risky random choice but it is actually the result of a lot of emotionalmental work i struggle daily with thinking this is a phase and ill regret it and ill feel stupid and come crawling back to my 95 i think i still have a bit more emotional work to do before i fully take the plunge but this really helped me thank you for sharing and congrats on successfully chasing a dream
2572	1	yes mindfulness is a big thing for me this year too also being more intentional i started a blog this year but i wasnt very focused or consistent with it and this year i definitely want to concentrate on that and hone in on the skills that come with it
2573	1	love what you are doing there btw
2574	1	some of these turbans are similarly priced to grace eleyae is but they have way more colors and choices nice and the clearanced ones are more in my price range 30
2575	1	wow congrats on your novel that is an amazing accomplishment this is really motivating because i feel like been blocked by the mindset that i need someone to give me permission or tell me im good enough to actually go for it but sometimes you just have to do it  if you have creative impulse and enjoy making your art that is enough i think ill check out that podcast thanks for sharing
2576	1	yess i like hearing both black gender perspectives thanks
2577	1	just got done browsing your suggestions thank youu
2578	1	can you elaborate on the disrespect how is wanting no one to say the word not a strong stance against disrespect since they view the the word as disrespectful inappropriate in all situations
2579	1	fair point he should have handled it differently
2580	1	i always say chase is a great track but it got sandwiched between the first and last ops which are also good
2581	1	lmao facts but like do you fuck with her music
2582	1	true bad wording many cubans are white but not all are i was thinking moreso in america and not still in cuba

2584	1	black boys and men get investment on a larger scale than black girls according to the aapfo limited philanthropic investment compared to male peers over the last decade over 100 million dollars has been invested in achievement dropout prevention and mentoring initiatives exclusively targeting black and brown boys during this same period less than 1 million dollars in funding targeted black and brown girls  and heres the link in case anyones interestedhttpsstatic1squarespacecomstatic53f20d90e4b0b80451158d8ct5422de0ee4b080d53cf825541411571214756didyouknow_plightofblackwomenpdfa surprising amount of people are apparently unaware of this despite initiatives like these existinghttpsobamawhitehousearchivesgovmybrotherskeeperhttpswwwblackmaleachievementorghttpbmafundersorgquantifyinghope_ga2130496780209805254515433724887844435791543372488https100blackmenorghttpwwwheinzorgjustpittsburghafricanamericanmenandboyshttpswwwmillionhoodiesnet  and many more
2585	1	if its inserted properly you dont feel it like other people have said it might take a few tries but dont feel intimidated once you get the hang of it its worth it
2586	1	exactly every black person ive run into eats multiple greens but ive never run into dandelion that is really good to know
2587	1	so much this
2588	1	what if that scene is after the doppelgängers switch them out or something lupita has rhythm somethings up
2589	1	to me it sounds more like she had to push through or more likely learn that her own comfort should be discarded to have any friends at all i dont really follow her to know much about her adult life to know if that is a good take
2590	1	i screamed
2591	1	i thought it was cute lol
2592	1	meme seems like a joke
2593	1	writing writing writing im with you
2594	1	the fact that safe  spaces even exist implies that that basic decency is not met outside them free speech is little more than a blatant dog whistle for bigotry and theres no reason to welcome or entertain it
2595	1	i have no regrets this year haha
2596	1	aha  this is nice to know ive been getting massages regularly for years and never experienced that or been advised of it  thanks for enlightening me
2597	1	because its evident that the sun has touched your skin for a pleasurable amount of time what could be better
2598	1	the problem is her asking the question in the first place bub does she expect one unified answer does she think theres some sort of black coalition that agrees on cultural appropriation whats her intention in asking a question that she knows the answer to as stated in her first sentence and so what if she gets permission from that sub thats not in any way solving the issue at hand nor does it answer the question as the question is essentially unanswerableshe wasnt asking to come into the space she came in on her own and asked an ignorant question full stop and she knew it was an ignorant question and the people in that thread coddled her so its whatever anyways lol she couldve easily googled to get diverse answers but she made a different decision
2599	1	wasnt it earlier this year that how much black people love sprite went viral i remember cracking up at all the memes
2600	1	it depends on what your are going to the library for im aware that libraries host events meant for community members to interact somebody sitting by themselves working is a different story and i understand her frustration
2601	1	seriously my ghost wouldve just left my body and been done with it then the rumors that im possessed wouldve started
2602	1	theyre really good at doing that so i dont blame you even as an adult i have people assuming i was raised without a father
2603	1	wait so youre telling me white and asian people are getting upset over nothing especially those on rapplyingtocollege ayyyy can you explain more because most people dont know this why do people think it applies to college admissions and harvard was in a lawsuit for this same thing
2604	1	i kinda agree if your polite then i can say no thank you without the fear of dying but at the same time guys should be able to read the room and make sure its even appropriate
2605	1	yes what with child actors and ruined memories im just glad he is doing well
2606	1	yes i do i consume about a gallon per day if i havent been earing enough vegetables
2607	1	then why is harvard in a lawsuit im also aware quotas are illegal
2608	1	youre right i do have a lot of empathy for those who grew up around white people lol but i mean youre an adult nowbut year imma cut a girl some slackedit and if you wouldve seen her smh you would be very attracted to her
2609	1	right i feel like theres more things important than going the european traditional way another thing why i want to go another route is because i feel like big papa can easily look into our business i dont like it rather have it between me and my husband
2610	1	gtwhat do you want to say that you cant say nowi will be using this
2611	1	thats honestly one of the funniest things ive ever read truly a line for the gold digger hall if fame
2612	1	youre missing the point you cant avoid being treated like shit just by avoiding black men if you focused on race instead of behavior you missed the lesson
2613	1	what made you decide to go to a pwi and thank you
2614	1	i dont know i found this sub accidentally looking for something else and would hate for another black woman to miss out on the support system is there anyway to prevent crossposting
2615	1	yes i am and ok thanks
2616	1	im not sure if youre coming from the right place there are plenty of rich people like lebron james and bill gates that donate to people in need i dont think the problem here should be that he appears rich having valuable possessions does not equal mismanaging money however it does raise the question if hes not putting his congregation first but thats mainly for the congregation to judge not outsiders that dont know how the church functions i do think that despite whatever salary hes making that amount of money is poor financial choice especially because cars like that are not easy to maintain however if a pastors pulls up in a luxury car and gives his wife a piece of jewelry we shouldnt be so quick to raise eyebrows we dont know if they saved money to get those possessions or what the price of those possessions may even be in this case we do so we know its ridiculous but we cant expect pastors to drive around in junk trucks and poor mans clothes
2617	1	this creating something is sometimes more hurtful than finding where to join
2618	1	thanks for the responsei totally will look into the ed tech thing i think it might really fit with my needs and my new skills
2619	1	he actually blasts pastors like these all the time i even asked him about this guy and he was so mad he is extremely antigreed and lasvisciousness he always makes sure to tell everyone to pitch in for the church needs including himself and lists what the church actually needs however he is not against getting valuable things for your family he probably just believes you need to take care of your congregation first honestly maintaining and attracting people to the congregation is already hard enough people dont realize that a church actually needs income to function and do the charity that they do people also dont give enough credit to the churches especially the megachurches like his that are giving to the needy they just see cases like his and run with it he does christians a disservice but its so easy for nonbelievers other christians and members of the congregation to write churches off because of situations like this but churches are not a monolith people may get defensive because the general public doesnt actually know or care about how a church is run they just assume the pastor puts on a suit drives to church preaches the word and the cycle continues they dont realize you need equipment wifi heat electricity food etc people in the churches are still humans and their physiological needs need to met before they are ready to listen to the word of god pastors know this the church needs to kept clean and look presentable people care about the environment the personality of the pastor and other things it is not easy to maintain a congregation
2620	1	yeah that logic was a 100 year old wooden rollercoaster with about half a rickety leg to stand on resting on a the typical ever crumbling cement foundation of pissstinking patriarchal denial and entitlement
2621	1	wtf
2622	1	that is why i love black lightning not many shows feature a beautiful loveable smart darkskinned wife with short type 4 natural hair i love her
2623	1	i think since bm are three times as likely to marry outside the race and more likely to date outside the race than black women there will always be that thought in some people is minds that we are jealous are black men able to date out more easily than bw absolutely i wont deny that but that doesnt mean we are jealous ive definitely seen black men and some nonblack people use the fact that we arent as desirable to men of other races as black men are to women of other races to make black women seem bitter and jealous i just wish people would stop with that
2624	1	thank you  the getting married is the most important part but having a beautiful dress sure is like a cherry on top
2625	1	yes and so am i
2626	1	still working on the routine not planning to keep it short just trying and failing to grow it out but im in a space of not caring for it to grow back lol how about you
2627	1	there is a difference however a lot of the threads are unrealistic and exaggerated
2628	1	pretty sure hes a mestizo native americanwhite mix
2629	1	those
2630	1	here is my blog post ranking mcu movies with reasoning it is old but if i had to update it id put black panther and homecoming at the top infinity war in the top quartile and antman 2 in the lower quartilehttpsnastynattysraucousreviewswordpresscom20170625adefinitiverankingofthemarvelcinematicuniverse
2631	1	thank you
2632	1	i lurk lipstickalley sometimes and theyve said hes a serial cheater hopefully its not true
2633	1	4ish years ago
2634	1	those wolves ughghhh  every time you gotta chase someone on horse im like yeah this is gonna take a couple tries
2635	1	that was detailed and easier to wrap my head around thanks
2636	1	gtbut did he rape herthankyou the age or race of the perpetrator amp victim dont have a damn thing to do with it
2637	1	i look at how my parents and grandparents handled that and they always framed it as a sense of pride not being born at a disadvantage but pride in the people i came from and the character it builds i think it is also important not to overestate their advantages they definitely have financial and some social advantages and that is a big deal but theyre mostly disconnected from a complete human experience while we live one of the fullest we have no reason to envy or even aspire to be them in that sense even their economic advantages were gotten by way of theft rape and murder we know that but it is easy to forgeti often heard older black people talk about white people as if they were weak and hollow and that stuck with me and it is probably why my heart was never broken
2638	1	not only were they on a public platform but it is incredibly easy to own it and apologize saying youve grown from that instead he makes a whiny post to stop telling people to look for things to get offended over
2639	1	soul sister lmao it is so gross
2640	1	are there coloring book recommendations for black girls
2641	1	haha guess i cant be mad when the trash takes itself out
2642	1	not the person you replied to but yeah she does no makeup stuff a lot too she doesnt even use a crazy level beat
2643	1	oh yea i didnt pay that part any mind it was just way too silly lol
2644	1	performing a sex act on women  gay how sway how
2645	1	agreed d
2646	1	when we cross that bridge hopefully the world can come to understanding aside from kevin imagine everything you worked for destroyed because you did or said something that you apologized and repented for years ago in chappelles case watch when they want his ass in a white space or big project comes out with his name attached theyll come for chappelle kevin hasnt been actually funny in years laugh at my pain was really funny and that was in 2011 lets  be real theyre rallying behind kevin because people are growing more annoyed with digging up a persons past to destroy their present if kevin hasnt changed fine die on that cross nigga  but if you change as a human then we should be able accept hisher apology and move onalso i appreciate this discussion thank you for showing me your points of view respectfully
2647	1	this was my first thought occasionally i must present as one of the good ones or enough to get that treatment those are the times ive had them basically trying to shove opioids at me i think the opioid crisis has changed some things but were still going to bear the brunt of them cutting back even if theyre cutting white people off too
2648	1	i think we might get an overflow of black women venting about that here because where else are we going to go but still yes lolwe get fed that from all angles from birth so i see how it happens
2649	1	in no way do we have different dna
2650	1	are the poor folk seeing any of that money though weve got rough sleepers dying on our streets the country is very unequal
2651	1	i teared up a little at the end of chapter 6 but there are two meh epilogue chapters after that to connect this game to the first  i got attached to the gang and arthur really makes an effort to be a good person your honor level at the end of chapter 6 determines what ending you get btw the narrative is awesome and movingi spent a questionable amount of time hunting because i wanted to craft the satchel that allowed me to carry 99 copies of each item hunting was pretty fun but can be frustrating when you need a perfect pelt and theres no animals around with one
2652	1	hispaniclatino people can be white passing meaning they look white but they are still hispaniclatino for example my ex looks like a regular white guy but he is actually cuban
2653	1	thank you
2654	1	hm ive not really felt that with 5e mostly it made playing less granular but i dont doubt that there are some things that had rules in 35 that dont nowdont confuse that with not being allowed to do those things though do whatever is fun and that you can rule consistently i like to think of ttrpg rulebooks as permissions not laws
2655	1	gtnot to be that personshouldve stopped right there because you are being that person
2656	1	twitter is too toxic for my infj self full of misinformed hipsters and hiteps i wish there was a place where you can enjoy veibg black nerdy a d awkward
2657	1	congrats
2658	1	that is how i felt why are black people being compared to animals by really pushing that point the argument loses steam and i feel it discourages other black people who might want to try to be veggievegan
2659	1	ohhh yes my mind is constantly racing and i hardly ever get a break from the intrusive thoughts mine are very perfectionistic so if things arent just so i kinda take it out on my body my mind does the rest thats amazing the shave helped you a lot of people opt to shave rather than keep the spots unfortunately where mine is its a bit too high to shave also its almost bald on my crown
2660	1	i have always felt guilty when buying myself something like it would be wiser to spend it on paying off debts and such every now and then ill buy some new leggings or a videogame but it is really hard to splurge
2661	1	i heard that chris rock joke about black people and slurs a few too many times from folks who looked nothing like me this was before memes became mainstreami worry about my niece not the cigarettes not the bullying not the fashion but the ignorant remarks from kids who dont know very many black people
2662	1	those reasons are a huge part of why i lived there for so long i just couldnt deal with the people anymore i made friends who are basically family to me but none of them are white lol so much passive racism there im glad youre having a good experience in nashville ive always wanted to visit there
2663	1	yes ive been saying this for months these cutesy nicknames do nothing
2664	1	theres more httpsyoutubeo_mru7fasfm
2665	1	i feel this so wholeheartedly yo im 22 and i recently just had to move back home to my mamas house after dealing with the hardships of being on my own children is definitely not in my budget at this time and i have so much mental health issues i cannot even fathom of taking care little humans wholl need care 247
2666	1	yiiiiikes
2667	1	literally im not about to limit my options because all the black men around me arent checking for me even when i went out of my way to try to date some of the black boys on my campus theyd all flake or call it off or end up with my friend i had a convo with a white girl and we agreed that black men allow thenselves to be fetishized here because its done by white asian and nonblack latinas in fact many of them love being fetishized by highly desired women after three years of witnessing this im just done yes people fetishize black women but its not the same and most of us call it outcheck people for it why should i wait for a black man to see me as a romantic option when there are so many nonblack men around me who already do i recently held a black student mixer at my school and that was literally the first time a black guy has openly initiated flirting with me since being in college a whole ass 3 years and he doesnt even go to my school i know this isnt the case for everyone and peoples experiences are largely determined by their location but damn black people of all genders love demonizing black women in irr while allowingaccepting it for black men my own father would regularly cheat on my mother with nonblack women has tons of mixed race children that he doesnt claim running around but still gets mad at my mom for sleeping with a white guy when they werent even together and dont let anyone tell him his daughters are with nonblack people
2668	1	ikr didnt think i would find a dress i liked so much cuz i never cried lol
2669	1	probably tbh i think its a bad way to elicit sympathy because she still made her play the slave role instead of being herself
2670	1	glad to help yay for dream chasing
2671	1	then maybe more black men should speak up
2672	1	yup just registered today
2673	1	i have a feeling that donald glover is existence on this sub is being model to invalidate his blackness due to either his sexual kinks or romantic partners i dont support his previous fetishization of asian women whatsoever but his quote about the whole nggerdick thing was multilayered and can range from power stemming from embracing stigma or just bdsm degradation personally i think everyone is taking a stand up special far too seriously and way too personally but like i said thats just me
2674	1	thank you
2675	1	victim blaming wow you need to chill with the buzzwords and open your mind the world isnt black and white im not your enemy or victim blaming just because i see fault in your actions too not everyone shares the same mindset as you having a different point of view doesnt make me a victim blameralso i didnt say you were equally at fault im saying your actions arent perfect i can see what you did to contribute to the situation im saying neither one of you handled it in a mature way
2676	1	me too
2677	1	for what it is worth brock turner is trial was in california if im reading it right maps like thishttpswwwsentencingprojectorgthefactsmapdatasetoptionbwr make me think we give areas outside the south way too much credit
2678	1	he was wrong and the funds need to be returned totally and patently unacceptable i am not a protestant and this is one huge issue i have with protestant nondenominational megachurches
2679	1	it is bollocks i had a grown ass man 30 is say pegging is gay when a woman pegs a man truly baffling how can anything a heterosexual couple does be gay
2680	1	fam drink some prune juice and let the shit go
2681	1	im not aruging but you too
2682	1	not that i know of but last time i checked lgbt issues were championed in a separate movement youd have to ask someone more versed in lgbt activism if there was one that was only for black people but lgbt people as a whole had their own movement as wellbut how is that linked in anyway to what i said do you think having separate movents is bad somehow
2683	1	i still eat seafood but when i got shrimp for my aquarium i realized why so many religions ban eating shrimp etc it really is true that it is nasty to eat them they literally eat trash and shit all day long now i have a hard time eating crab lobster and shrimp also crabs look like spiders which really scared me as a child
2684	1	what im actually confused as to the logistics to this because i swear in the 90s half the regular channels played these all the damn time like even if you didnt like the shows wasnt fuck else on tv
2685	1	the real question to be answered in about 15 years is will the grandchildren of west indian immigrants still wash the wares by handi should probably tack on a question about clothes lines too there may be a fair number of southerners who still swear by hanging their clothes and sheets outside
2686	1	i wish you the best on this journey
2687	1	tbh theyre not really making a good argument theyre saying trans racialism is the same as transgenderism
2688	1	i understand where youre coming from with the broad trends and youre absolutely right it does leave out a lot of things in the article like you mentioned above and id like to find a more comprehensive study there arent many and they dont tend to focus on racial preference thank you for reminding me not to trust blind statsfrom what i understood okc matches are determined the qualityoption based on what answers one answers to tailor their profile there are hundreds of questions hopefully to weed out other incompatibilities and leave matches that one would want i know no algorithm is perfect no one will fill out all the questions and maybe answering too many questions might deselect someone that could have been a good fit additionally  you may not have the volume of opportunities if you live in a less populated areai didnt feel uncomfortable with her mentioning itd be harder in the context of the conversation about cultural clashes it seemed more of an acknowledgement that racial bias still exists but not to get discouraged and here is some options  eta i was irritated about receiving unsolicited albeit good dating pointers but that is a personal problem im just not ready to date yet
2689	1	white women are white above and before their genderi think they would give the same or similar treatment to other woc but i also do think there are levels to this shit their lack of effort will vary based on which race and even down to the shade of skin tone
2690	1	and thats your opinion for me proper bdsms degradation constraints are fluid and dependent within the confines of whatever the sexual relationship is the only way i could see that as being truly problematic is if there are unconsenting parties such public degradation sorry but i dont think every kink needs to be reflected on if its not harming either party my only issue about what he described in his standup was her because there was no context of him being okay with her saying that beforehand other than that i dont see an issue
2691	1	ive been in plenty of interracial relationships and maybe a big factor is not being american but im sorry you have to explain yourself or have a family not like you   this is something ive never ever had to do or worry about
2692	1	it certainly will im glad she brought this up
2693	1	when i write myself as a character in my stories ill occasionally draft i imagine an alter ego lol i will definitely try
2694	1	exactly
2695	1	its amazing
2696	1	its a complicated issue for me i was never fully comfortable with nb people especially nb minorities but i was never fully comfortable with black people too pparticularly from my own ethnicity i think if i could go back in time i would still want to grow up in a nonblack minorityblack community because i wouldnt feel so alienated and like some strange pokémon the way i did growing up my freshman roommate setup  in college was literally the united nations and when i got to college i felt less threatened because i was around more diversity
2697	1	if there is an aggravation enlightenment level ive surpassed it  ugh
2698	1	if you apologize and your actions dont affirm your words is it so unreasonableis it unreasonable to think someone is being disingenuous if they apologize but also go into a rage about imaginary anger especially someone who could easily have a pr guy say one thing and then do stupid shit himself
2699	1	bahahahah this is why you cant talk to white people about race they are completely clueless but white supremacy means theyve never actually had to think through any of their crazy handmedown racist ideas historically they murder millions up until their get guilted enough to put up a dumb memorial statue then they can sleep at night in peace cause were dead and they dont have to feel guilty about the shit they stole from us they have been doing this same shit for centuries these resourcehoarding cave dwellers wont stop until the entire planet is destroyed at the behest of a couple of rich people and brown people are footnoted in history books seems crazy but im sure every victim of genocide was called paranoid right up until theyre put in a gas chamber when can we get some evolved white people in this shithole country
2700	1	httpswwwredditcomrbrownbeautycommentsaazai4need_advicetroll confirmed

2706	1	thanks shes never called me it she just says it casually and not often but everyone now and again like i added above only if shes talking in a story or something like that
2707	1	utynitty516 watch the derailing i know you know that is not what usolelycurious meant
2708	1	people need their projects it is the new century nobody is looking for their fifteen minutes of fame people are just looking for things to do they may not be funny but if she is having fun making them then that counts for something because heck if that is her way of staying sane then we probably dont want to take that from her
2709	1	i didnt know i would have to analyze like that till now i dont want to watch out what i say not to mention i dont like disclosing information about us because majority of them already know whites just want to read perspectives the fact that whites have more access to our statistics our sources stories etc is crazy to me i believe theres something we can do but it is bad enough whites know more about black people than black people know about themselves
2710	1	especially here in seattle
2711	1	you have to login through the actual site and adjust your settings saying you are 18 and want to view nsfw material
2712	1	im sorry how do you deal with it
2713	1	ingenious
2714	1	good pay for your racism mf
2715	1	the last post on here said they were tired of black men because 1 black man out of hundreds said something ignorant on instagram we focus on negativity too much in my opinion
2716	1	nope you can adjust the age and location range also have the option of noting if you drinksmoke etc
2717	1	onlinei met other guys cyclingoh and i had a photo of me on my bike in my ad
2718	1	youre emotional response is completely valid i know it sucks if you havent tried therapy that might be a good option
2719	1	i personally am for making it private i wanted to comment on that post but didnt because i feared on what nonblack lurkers would saycross post it also im active in nonpoc oriented subs and want to keep some discussions we have on this subreddit private and not in my comment history
2720	1	the reason why interracial discussions are discouraged is because theyre all everyone wanted to talk about all the time practically every other black woman on here is dating a nonblack dude blackladies has a reputation for that i detect a troll lmao
2721	1	this implies the sole reason to go to school is for a capitalist definition of productivity dont see how or even why to limit the amount of say english majors without it being inherently discriminatory
2722	1	yes i agree at the end of the day it really is just hair what someone else does with their hair is their business and i think there is so much to a person besides the hair on their scalp
2723	1	it does im kind of done with america as a country so its expected that racism is everywhere but i was just curious i heard some rumors about boston
2724	1	father god  i just want to pray for this lost soul  she knows not what she says  the enemy has confused her taste buds black jesus and now she runs the path of excess   save her from herself  heal her in this moment i pray
2725	1	this is a safe space the op should be able to vent without being accused of whining projecting her insecurities not loving herself or secretly lusting after her boyfriend is friend i get being tired of posts like this but there are still women dealing with situations like these and this is supposed to be a place for them too if you cant figure out a way to reply to the thread constructively then maybe you should move along
2726	1	yep they banned me because of it
2727	1	what are keen featuresbut you do bring up a point that i havent really considered it is obvious that light skinned women are more desirable for men but i never really thought about the marriagelegitimacy conceptalthough i know it is silly i pondered once or twice if i were a bit lighter thus looking more like the racist western ideal of femininity would that have prompted men to act and react to me differently and be more inclined towards seriousnesscause i definitely know in certain situations if i were white the police or store owner or person wouldnt have treated me like that but it is weird when this line of thinking randomly pops up in romance because it is a little less clear in those situations and you dont know if youre just bugging because youre dealing with someone who knows you and likes you so it is not like theyre a stranger who would consciously operate with biasbut how about if the way that people treat you at all not in particular instances but just in general is inherently different due to how you look that is something that is hard to prove but also hard to verify because there is really nothing else in your life experience that you can contrast it to meh i guess im just describing racism now but it is weird if you think about it from out perspective because we maybe will never know how it feels to operate in a world with no bias because our skin color affects the way we are viewed and thus how people respond in little or big ways such a shame
2728	1	if the first poster is correct about her circumstances then she shouldnt have been tried as a competent adult being as she is a mentally unstable teenager   personality disorder and abuse she needs treatment not incarceration

2743	1	that is the thing though all these african countries are taking out loans but there is no improvement in health education or infrastructure on the contrary even those are privatized or outsourced where is the money goingwe know wherealso most people forget that most of these loans come with strings attached that usually include having to use chineseor western companies or workers in the projects most of the money probably barely ever even reaches the african coffers
2744	1	i live in this area as well and am dark skinned  i think it is getting easier to date bm the older i get
2745	1	this we have been too strong for too long after all we have gone through as a people who do you think will survive and even thrive after the collapse we keep each other close thank you
2746	1	this
2747	1	my friend was very high and kinda drunk at the time she met him on tinder and they went out once and she described him as a sweet guy so i went along with it when we first met he had rniceguys written all over him he was the most corny person i had ever met he wanted us to walk like 3045 minutes with him to an obscure karaoke bar and my friend was not down she told me she wanted to go home and we arrived together say no more were going home and she and i started walking down the street away from him and towards her car he put his hands on her trying to drag her from me saying he and his girl need a minute um i think the fuck not she met him once before and is not his girl i told him no shes my best friend and she wants to go home so were leaving he put his chest on me starting calling me a pussy licker thinking thats gonna bother me me and her were laughing at the time because he was so corny and i could only think about how ridiculous this situation is but it was crazy how fast he flipped he was literally so close to my neck i could feel his breath the entire time we were walking he complained about this generation and how were all lesbians and the reason why he couldnt lick my friends pussy was because i was already licking hers completely and overly aggressive i dont think my friend had ever been in a situation like that before but unfortunately this isnt my first time dealing with an aggressive man who doesnt like to be told no i am small but i walk tall and a lot of men do not like it
2748	1	lolol yup   see my fear is proposing to my girl in public and she say no lolol when its time for me to propose im doing that shit at home
2749	1	kinda harsh but i guess youre not wrong
2750	1	this  girl i wouldnt waste a minute is thought on this guy it is not even just a question of racismjust imagine what a boring person you would be if you only wanted to date people based on what your parentsfriendssociety thought was right for you this kid just flat out admitted that he has no mind or desires of his own he is afraid of breaking the mold because he is insecure it has nothing to do with you or how desirable you are but your friends they do not get to be on your team if they cant stand up for you in situations like this or at least be supportive of you after the fact they might just be confused and awkward and not know how to react appropriately but you gotta bring it up to them tell them why this was hurtful and how they could have had your back otherwise they might grow to believe that this shit is acceptable
2751	1	neurodivergent
2752	1	gt i also do not support private education in k12completely forgot to mention this last night what concerns do you have about private education
2753	1	if you read the sidebar you wouldnt have this question this really wasnt the post to put your ignorance on display do better
2754	1	thats racism not colorism and if a guy doesnt want to date me because im black that is his problem there are plenty of men where that isnt an issue why would i focus on the ones who dont want mewhen you get out of the high school environment where everyone is worried about what people think of them youll find that there are plenty of men who want to date black women no matter if shes dark skinned or light skinned
2755	1	the religion reason has never made much sense to me at least in comparing black men and women black men are less religious but more openly or aggressively homophobic which i think is what op is pointing out
2756	1	yes id love for an exclusive blackladies forum one day
2757	1	you can comment in this sub when your acct has some hair on its chest
2758	1	white people from south jersey are the worst a vast majority of them are descendants whose parents fled our cities and hate all things black and brown the whole state is a segregated mess
2759	1	youre attaching physical traits next nerdom and you bring up hygiene why  is there ever going to be a clear definition of nerd   i feel like you are stereotyping a bit  being unhygienic or being short are not traits that are singular to nerds  in fact i think theyre moot points  most of the kids i grew up with who were in science bowls and part of av club werent unhygienic and they werent necessarily short   i also think science and mathematics are masculine  ive never seen people accused of being overly feminine  because theyre taking university calculus in high school   i dont see how this relates to masculinity  who are setting parameters for masculinity  it seems like your suggesting that swagged out rapper masculine and nerdy engineer feminine   i think in practice society suggests the opposite   usually engineering is heavily masculine and entertainment is heavily feminine
2760	1	bc half those apps doesnt contain real men only dehydrated ones who never came in contact with a female
2761	1	lol is your comment satire probably not typical hive response yo maybe calm the fuck down this is why people think you bey stans are fucking insane in the brain
2762	1	yaass you are going for it and i love it this is all great advice and i think there is something essential is finding a community to lean on for advice and support as you mentioned i lost touch with a lot of my writer friends from college partially out of jealousy on my end that they had the resources andor courage to continue to pursue writing as a career and i was just self conscious and lost im working on building a community through taking more workshops and stuff but i could definitely stand to put myself out there more than i am right now thanks for your encouragement it helps good luck to you and congrats on taking the leap
2763	1	whatever you say boo keep being condescending
2764	1	i gave my testimony that i was like that too i was apartment of the women that entertained guys knowing they werent good for me i dont want you or others to think im some ignorant black women who has never been in that situation others definitely dont have my story but what makes us similar is the reason why we did what we did how empathetic do you expect me to be because i am towards my own im not going to sugar coat or pretend everyone doesnt have a role in each others lives because we do that is apart of a society influencers we do or may like one thing bc momma or dad did it or he may learned a lesson by watching another being in that situation im not making it about me im just telling you how common and real it is
2765	1	i only do when they arent making their money and careers specifically off spaces that are traditionally nonprofit and built on people is needs for hope and support he should have found a way to get rich that didnt involve a whole book of moral codes
2766	1	gtsocial media and society at large only reinforce those unhealthy beautydont let some people in here see this theyre going to still say it is the parents job to control that but how when our children go to school friends house etc
2767	1	gtmen are holding these guys accountableit is not another man business if a toxic male decides to mistreat women he can not physically and mentally change a grown mani would like to give some examples and experiences that i witnessed this is not to shame humiliate or go against us this is a touchy subject for me because i had to go through so many men with different backgrounds status etc dating wasnt an issue for me when i met a lot of black men i didnt have to touch them have sex with him have their children etc to realize something was wrong with them however i did waste my time and realize that men hurting to the point they are diseased some basic traits i noticed were men calling women bitches listening toxicity music that i felt was embarrassing to black women dont understand how to read a woman come from an abusive household thinks making love should be within the first week to 2 monthsladies you can find a lot about a man through his childhood theres so many examples and hints that should warn us it is crazy men that cant communicate become angry easily become quite easily always on the phone feed your physical but cant feed your mental pointless conversations but will treat you etc this stems from household influences outside influences and society from my personal experience men are bad liars this doesnt pertain to every woman but a lot of woman choose to ignore how many videos you see a black woman cry and give her testimony not even 2 seconds into a video her description of her ex is abusive the whole world can see the traits before a testimony is given point is we can spot it we may see it we have to learn how to leave itthis is not a good man responsible to pick up the slack from toxic masculinity it is not their fault issue or concern the most they can do is treat women they meet in their pathgtplus its tiring to have to go through so many bad men to get to the good ones yes it is hence why i said try other poc blacks isnt solely african americans you have natives africans islanders and aboriginals
2768	1	maam lets agree to disagree you seem to believe that i am in some way responsible for his treatment of me youre free to believe that could i have phrased it better yes i was just confused by why he was treating me like crap all of a sudden in hindsight there were red flags this is the second time hes done this and based on some things hes told me im starting to realize that this is a pattern with him that i want no parts of like i said as far as i am concerned he and i are finished as there is zero chance of things going back to normal this is more energy than what i wanted to give to this again merry christmas to you and yours
2769	1	never said they couldnt

2774	1	none  were all american but 1 that is not what the tweet is about and 2 are you getting ready to gate keep blackness
2775	1	the fact that stereotypes exist and can influence behavior does not mean all problems with black people can be solved by black people not believing stereotypes that is a piece of the problem not the entire thing

2784	1	hell yea
2785	1	i love these types of post if you have irish in your family most likely they mixed with natives your family allies with them or they were enslaved by them the irish was lenient then as far as africans research more of your family and look at the towns they were in are they from the areas with cotton fields
2786	1	hah i am from the detroit side of mi i lived in the suburbs in another town though the target story and where im currently at is in wi but im looking to move back to mi because i miss the energyfuck that lady indeed bright side is that was the only time i saw her which is saying something because i practically live at target
2787	1	i first heard about her probably 10 years ago when her music had been out of print for decades and people generally didnt know that she was a woman or even if she was still alive im so glad she is been able to come back into the public eye to be celebrated in her lifetime
2788	1	i have a similar internal conflict im glad she called it off before it was too late but also concerned that she pulled the trigger because of the public opinion even if the internet comments were right this one time it is still problematic to be this malleable to strangers opinions
2789	1	the real tea is that all men are trash
2790	1	gti agree with this except the xbox lol like it is a 300 game systemno even using 20 of the church is money on yourself is wrong gt please someone show me the verse specifically where it says pastors specifically and not all followers of christ are supposed to be poor no one is arguing that pastors are supposed to be poor theyre saying that a pastor shouldnt be making decisions that allow you to confuse him with the top 0001 of rich peopleand that a pastor who knows and follows the teachings of jesus is the first person who should know how christians should address their pursuit of wealthampx200bgtbut if it aint the church money he spending somebody show me some biblical support for him being dead wrong  ampx200bmatthew 1924   again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god psalm 7312   behold these are the wicked and always at ease they have increased in wealth proverbs 1126  he who withholds grain the people will curse him but blessing will be on the head of him who sells it proverbs 327  do not withhold good from those to whom it is due when it is in your power to do it james 513  come now you rich weep and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you your riches have rotted and your garments have become motheaten your gold and your silver have rusted and their rust will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire it is in the last days that you have stored up your treasure luke 624 but woe to you who are rich for you are receiving your comfort in full matthew 621  for where your treasure is there your heart will be also matthew 1921  jesus said unto himif thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me ampx200bampx200b
2791	1	thank you ill be in contact soon lol
2792	1	theres plenty of black women out there  you not wanting to deal with black men doesnt matter lol  have fun getting asked to have your hair touched by your passiveaggressive inlaws
2793	1	gtbut it is bad enough whites know more about black people than black people know about themselvesthat is true in a lot of circumstances but it is really only with the information that they want to use and not necessarily the truth unfortunately there are black people that are disconnected from their own history or for the fight for black rights let is not pretend they dont distort history for their own benefit or know everything too ive found that the whites that just want to read perspectives will comment and say as a white person while trying to say something with good intentions even if it sounds ignorant while there are other white people that probably curious but they dont care about perspectives they just want to say why black people are wrong part of me feels like this sub can be an echo chamber i dont want it to be dominated by white people but i dont think its impossible to talk about black issues without being worried about the sub not being exclusively black if this sub is brigaded again i will probably change my mindampx200b
2794	1	do you wanna buy it
2795	1	i see what you mean then so i think we more or less agree i just dont like the idea of we cant do everything so we should do nothing which is an idea those people seem to have about the park and a lot of people hold about environmental stuff in general but i also hate the moral attachment to people not saving the world in the way you want them too  which is super prevalent in the vegan sub
2796	1	gtyou know what i was thinking about this whole situation and one of the reasons i think it is most important to openly critique the decisions of someone like john gray is so that pastors who are doing things right or only making minorly disputable decisions dont deal with the unfair fallout they sometimes doi think you misunderstood me in this entire conversation i in no way condone what he did what i have a problem with is you dragging christianity down with its members by not only attacking him but attacking pastors that lead megachurches attacking pastors that have valuable possessions and getting defensive when people say not to generalize all christiansi realize the church is rife with sin i realize the church has its problems however i didnt like how you assumed i was minimizing the issues in the church by saying not all churches are the same i also felt hurt and offended when you shut me down when i merely said we dont give the churches that are doing good enough attention sure you might have good intentions and you might think youre acting godly but why is it that people especially you dont post about the good things churches are doing and only focus on people like him i and other christians know pastors like him exist out there that doesnt mean we condone it there are christians that do but there are plenty of christians that dont it does more harm than good especially when unbelievers and other christians are judging the church more than ever to generalize the church and to only focus on the bad things we can do both but i feel like we dont do both equally gtone of my close friends is a pastor of a large and growing church and he already faces criticisms and accusations that i know are completely untrue we had a long conversation about this kind of thing a few weeks ago and it is one of the main reasons i dont believe it giving gross offenders too much leeway or saying not all pastorsnot all churches this is the kind of attitude i dont like there are so many churches especially ones like mine that are hypervigilant about people and are always trying to keep up appearances and show love and go the extra mile for visitors and their members the pastor at my church and his wife suffer from the same situation so why is it that saying not all churches is a bad thing how will more people be attracted to the church when they generalize everything and put it all in one box you were doing the same thing too we absolutely can address the problems in the church without silencing people but we also need to show the world that not every church is full of greed and strife it is not silencing people is concerns it is actually assauging their concerns because people wont be so scared or averse of going to church that is my concern one person commented that is why i steer clear of churches and it is really sad because it is not impossible to find a church for you if you dont feel comfortable you can always leave the church but it is always the bad apples that get attention and not the good ones which annoys me you sound like youre trying so hard to appease unbelievers but unlike pastor gray many churches are already trying to do that one church i go has a nice pastor that delivers great sermons they do so much for the world and the community the congregation is so friendly too but churches like that wont end up on this subreddit i think it is silencing the voices of the christians out there that dont want to associate with gray and also the ones out there doing good gtthere are people out there doing the work for real and they deserve as clear a path as possible i believe the only way that will happen is if were honest and direct about confronting what is going on in all corners of the religionwe both clearly care about the people out doing the work for real so why dont we focus on taking out the trash in the church while highlighting the good the church is doing at the same time that way we can give unbelievers and christians struggling in the faith a more accurate picture of what the church is like rather than just painting all christians as wolves and demons gtone of my biggest fears for the black church is that we turn into the whitened tombs that white evangelicals have and genuinely believe that leaders like gray who gravitate toward the same people they follow need to be weeded out quicklyi agree that gray has a problem and we dont need leaders like him in the church he only gives the church more bad press too it hinders the mission of christianity when people like him make bad decisions so i agree with you i just felt your approach was out of touch you werent raising pitchforks against just him you were doing it against christianity as a whole and when i tried to tell you there are good christians out there you shut me down furthermore we need to be careful not to use a pastor as substitute for our relationship with god i hear so many people that have had bad experiences with christians that they dont like church because they dont want to depend on pastors and be blind sheep or other statements like that but of course youre not supposed to follow your pastor blindly you are supposed to put effort into your personal relationship with god and merely use the pastor as a supplement and for spiritual guidance but not as a primary source god is supposed to be the primary source the role of a pastor is to help you develop your relationship with god in the first place
2797	1	i feel the same way
2798	1	may i ask activity wise what are your interests
2799	1	i dont disagree with you but i think it is not the fault of the students it is our workforce and education system that is flawed most young people dont have a career path in mind at 18 and if they do it is likely to change it is rare that you will be happy at age 40 in a career path you decided on at age 18 i dont believe we should be treating universities as trade schools they dont function that way
2800	1	i actually think it has a lot considering that it is a fairly long article
2801	1	the leftovers theme is nice im a sucker for keys and good instrumentals period the wire is theme song almost made my alternative list
2802	1	and existed way before any colonizers landed and to answer your questionmeth maybe
2803	1	i think because he mentioned her light skin especially and you never really hear guys say that about dark skinned black women
2804	1	sweet sweet victory
2805	1	because they dont appreciate the culture they just think its cool baby hairs are part of black culture and though it may seem like something little to you fashion and hairstyles are part of culture when black girls do it its still considered ghetto when everyone else wants to do it its considered cool and fashionable thats why its unfair thats why its sadits great that you get to share your culture with others because you dont fear it being stolen and used by others while you are teased for it thats fine but as other commenters have said when black culture is taken away its makes it seem like black people have no culture at all you get to have cajun culture regardless of what anyone says i dont get to have a culture because people steal from it everyday thats not fair or right and people have a right to be sad or pissed off about it
2806	1	nah i disagree they definitely are theyre not children if they have goodwill and intentionality with any other sphere of their life but not in their relationships with women it just indicates that this is not a part of his life that he is currently working to improve and that is fine but the problem is rather than being honest with the women in their lives society has raised them to be self serving and women accommodating so we put up with it so why should they behave otherwise
2807	1	yeah i mean i literally say ive been talking about it with my therapist at the end
2808	1	just like rblackpeopletwitter
2809	1	it is so crazy i was watching some youtube video and was thinking about successful black men who had black partners after lebron and dwade i couldnt think of any more and since so many black men have that mentality i see more women saying fuck it ill only date outside my race then literally no other race does this i have no idea how well fix it
2810	1	i see what you did there
2811	1	this she has showed you even told you who she is why are you questioning this drop this fake ass bitch and move on
2812	1	i literally cut all my hair down into a tiny fro so now i literally do nothing and i know i have the potential to do amazing things and i dont
2813	1	im so over dating rn i didnt even intend on meeting him in the first place because i lowkey need to focus on me rn i had an idea but now i need to make the decision of whether or not i want to let it all go
2814	1	good angles and good lighting with full body or action shots that arent suggestive of anything in particularthe second part was vague sorry basically i mean that i used the sites to meet people sooner rather than having back and forth text or emails because its easy to get stuck in that cycle the only way if you know that you vibe with someone is irl interaction and i personally believe that its better to do that fairly quickly once you realize all the basics are aligned to meet that way no one is wasting the other persons time
2815	1	not sure why this being down voted i thought it was known and accepted that there are some black people who would prefer the word not be used by anyone in order for it to die
2816	1	i personally dont think naptural85 is a very good recommendation for someone struggling with accepting her kinky hair yeah naptural85 is a 4a but her hair often looks more loosely textured than that plus it is always been longget on youtube and look for women that have kinky 4c hair that is short the inspiration is out there
2817	1	is justice even feasible at this point they fucked up half of the world theres so much blood on their hands they stole the americas new zealand and australia from the natives they raped the continent of africa and the country of india it just feels like the amount of damage they caused is wildly irreparable its mind boggling when i try to list it
2818	1	yeah i probably wouldnt mind throwing a few million at a family and letting them get shit for free if they were making me billions if they were creating jobs if they were still popular worldwide

2820	1	congrats youll have an amazing experience at either school  the friends ive had that went to both just love their alma maters i would just go where offers you more money  i know a ton of people who went to spelmanmorehouse that went on to amazing law schools like harvardberkeleyduke etc going to howard wont necessarily make it easier to get into husl i think but someone please correct me if im wrong  the key to law school is gpa and lsat
2821	1	this so much  wanted to add this was me in high school stuck at home with not the best people in my life i was depressed and it looked like no light in the my tunnel  everyone turned their back against me but i didnt give up study and work hard go to college play a sport get an academic or athletic scholarship and make it out you can do it op i am now loving my life working hard about to get ready to apply to medical school i graduated from college this past may and im so blessed i have my own apartment my own life and my family cant hold things against me or sentence me anymore i live 2 hours away and i can see them on my own terms i no longer feel like im drowning rather i have so much ambition and good things going for me i plan to settle on the east coast and work as a doctor not matter the cost i really hope you dont give up no matter how in despair you are in dont let others opinions define you if you work hard you can get yourself out of anything look to your counselors or a therapist for guidancemy favorite movie quote from pursuit of happiness  dont ever let someone tell you that you cant do something not even me you gotta dream you gotta protect it when people cant do something themselvestheyre gonna tell you that you cant do it you want something go get it periodgood luck op dont doubt yourself baby
2822	1	i feel that if it bothers you you may have a lot to understand but i get youre tryingwhen you live in a country built on racism and everyone is used to it or worse benefits from it it is easy to get hurt when every white person that claims to to be an ally is actually no better than someone who is more overt with their racism this isnt just with black people but many minorities in america have trouble finding white friends that arent complacent with racism it is somewhat inevitable in a culture that has seen black people as below others and ya were going to rant but i recommend always trying to read between the lines when a gay friend complains about some straight people im not offended because i know i dont fall into the category of people she would refer to so checking oneself is helpful as well ive seen posts where some may paint white people as the same at times but that is not an across the board idea and context is important as well  hope your night is lovelyedit add it is okay to be uncomfortable btw sometimes we need to feelnot bad but not quite good to realize some things i read through some of your other posts and saw your comment about posts like dear white women and how you found it divisive and alienating sadly black women live in alienation and i think understanding the how and why of that will help you be more understanding rather than offended andor botheredampx200b
2823	1	evilness cant be explained in a logical manner that your mind will accept nor understand historically speaking its a part of them i mean these humans are the bloodlines from the same sick fucks that went to africa stole humans and then went to america and killed most of the natives of course theyre giddy what suffering have their nation gone through cant look for healing from the person that hurt you fuck them

2826	1	good question i have no idea if they were with her but i think they probably would have not bat an eye at that most of the white people there were at least respectful not to say shit like that out loud i dont even like using the excuse of her being a child because black children her age are never seen as naive and innocent

2832	1	i get what disney was trying to do but they totally forgot about intersectionality i think their new narrative that theyre going for is princess saves herselfothers instead of having to be saved by a man because theyre trying to be empowering to girls but they totally forgotignored the fact that black women have been saving the day for everybody since time immemorial
2833	1	forever 21 is its own realm of fashion and they will literally put anything on a shelfrack if any of that starts to pop up in hampm express or zara then we are all doomed
2834	1	again race is not biological it is social slapping a label on someone because of the body they were born into with no other context or connection is problematic af and this that youre doing deciding you have the right to tell someone else who they are because of who you want to be that is why some people have a problem the most common experience weve had with blackness is when people like you weaponize it as a way to box someone in to a small set of stereotypical behavior you are not in control of my life identification or narrative you do you im doing me period
2835	1	you are contradictory you say natives are migrants you say that africans migrated to north america precolonialism so therefore north american people who  identify as having african ancestry might not be fully african but you just said those native migrants are africando you just mean there were some indigenous people who were darker skinnedi dont understand why this is a thing in the usa for a myriad of reasons but that is your culture and you have your reasonsper your question you cant travel from an island to a continent via a river you seem confused by what i said the original caribbean amerindians were migrants from south america the orinoco river is in the south american continent and they travelled through it and came upon the caribbean islands which were previously uninhabited european colonization resulted in genocide but some places still have communities of peoples or at least are aware of their ancestry if there was mostly miscegenation my sources were textbooks at school etc that is what im saying nobody from the caribbean thinks caribbean amerindians are extinct

2837	1	i dread trump is death when people insist we respect himim also 100 certain he will pass or do one slightly decent thing solely because our society is so accommodating to white mediocrity that an alarming number of people will call him a hero for it worked for john mccain and the recently dead zombush too

2842	1	i agree defining as physical features is very helpful and we can all agree on that as a unique identifier
2843	1	lots of moms dont have great support networks or much leave time that leads to bed sharing because infants sleep better next to their moms and because mom doesnt have to get out of bed to nurse during wake ups most women are just trying to get through the early months everyone knows the sids numbers but what does that matter if you dont have the support to do anything else bed sharing isnt an automatic death sentence and it is less dangerous than falling asleep after you got up to nurse at 3 am on the couch or a chair im not pro bed sharing and i didnt although id be lying to say i followed safe sleep recs to a t or that it never accidently happened but i find current safe sleep campaigns to be nothing more than mom shaming same with breast is besti wish the question was what do moms need to stop bed sharing and not omg this is the worst parenting ever doesnt she know better that answer is always more protected paid leave
2844	1	the consequences of unplugging logging out should be interesting im personally looking forward to seeing how lupita and winston handle jordan is new film genre

2847	1	after hearing your response i honestly dont think you are ready for it some girls are up for it and some are simply not and it makes me sad to see women get hurt because they fell for some glamorized version of this

2856	1	you refuse to research everything lol but we are the ones with the comprehension problem youre demanding labor when you need to pick up a damn book
2857	1	it is downright shameful for a rapper to handover all writing to staff hiphop is poetry the power of the art form lies in its soul you dont have to have lived what you rap it can be inspired by your observations it can be commentary on the world as you see it but it needs to come from you or atleast part of it from you you need to be part of the group who turns what is hopefully your idea into words when a rapper abdicates writing it is a sign the conglomerates have won it is no longer about the poetry it is about how good the labels team is all they have to do now is find a pretty girl and everything else can be manufactured even ratchet can be cooked up around a board room table oh and please be sure that there is no room for black girls in the cooking racially ambiguous girls are by far easier to market across all demographics just letting you know in advance
2858	1	thank you im trying myybest
2859	1	it is not intrusive at all and i understand your assumption totallyhowever the thread is biggest relationship fear not terrible issue youre dealing with so it is my fear but it is a little irrational and tied more to my sense of insecuritiesexperience with racism than to the way my husband treats me like the other posters have said theyd find out theyd been lied to or that theyre with someone who didnt care for them anymore finding that out when you think otherwise would be devastatingdoes that makes sense

2864	1	it is very blurry i thought of myself as lower middle or working class i always went to private schoold through grad school with no stufent loans my mom made me take one but gave me a new car in the amount of the loan for graduation  we always had at least one house sometimes two and at least one car per adult sometimes more  i work in tech and have always had a stem career i have a graduate degree a house in coastal ca my husband has a house too  and make in the top 7 for african american women i still feel poorish inhave only ever lived in los angeles san diego and the san francisco bay areai went to jury duty recently most baristas in our area are as educated as me i rarely interact with people who arent my pals who grew up legit rich have a similar lifestyle  a few of them are the kids of people who founded companies youd recognizethe interactions ive had with nonneighbors and people i didnt grow up with as well as from reading make me think maybe i am upper middle class im not super unusual in my family edit  my finger fumble typos make it look like i didnt finish elementary school ill leave them for the irony
2865	1	gt in a sense weve come to our nation is capital to cash a check  it is obvious today that america has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned instead of honoring this sacred obligation america has given the negro people a bad check a check which has come back marked insufficient fundsheeeeeat i have a dream and i chopped it too what a shame the whole paragraph is whew
2866	1	i think the good thing about mass amp social media is that there are so many different body types out there for us to see i think it might be helpful to find people who have similar body types and admire them it will make beauty feel more attainable and it might help foster selfacceptance i think it is also good to limit exposure to people who have body types we cant naturally have i have an athletic build and i will never be thickcurvy with a small waist and a big butt i try not to follow too many people who like that lest i start wanting what i cant have
2867	1	thank you  its like the minute we stop laboring after everyone else and prioritize our feelings and needs its a problem but everyone else can do it no problem because theyre not expected to be long suffering mules some of yall really clutching your pearls hard over a strangers personal venting we just cant win with some people
2868	1	i am obsessed now
2869	1	i enjoy my relationship i do hes wonderful neither of us are perfect but he is by far the best thing that has ever happened to me what has typically happened is the guy im with dates and marries the next girl after me quickly granted they were not the right people for me but i feel like this happens a lot i build a boyfriend into a husband and he takes everything hes learned from me then marries someone else i dont want it to happen again
2870	1	becks as in becky indeed
2871	1	you know what i didnt see that at first but i get what youre saying
2872	1	gthowever why do you think black kids at predominately white schools are inherently getting a better education than black kids at black schoolsare we just going to ignore segregation and redlining at least most of the time that is the case public schools particularly in my town dont seem to have the same college driven focus that the private school near my town has it is either go to an expensive private school for me or move to the richer town next door which my family couldnt afford to dogt that is my thing most of the time the assumption that these schools are better is made simply because they are white schools and therefore must be betterthe assumption isnt because theyre white the assumption is made because of history and you can easily look up the school is programs graduation rates kids that get scholarships etc you cant assume people are just misinformed this view isnt just limited to black schools there is a great vocational school in my area that would have more black students  too but because theyre not as college driven as say the private school my parents steered clear of that school gt im just saying that good schools is often short hand for white schools and a cover for moving to a white areabecause in this world the good schools usually are white schools it is not because they hate black people there are relatively few areas with predominantly black people and good schools unfortunately so you have to pick and choose btw the good white schools or the bad black schools often
2873	1	which parts dont you understand or it is the whole entire thing ill try to summarize im not the best at long responses anyway
2874	1	damn i got got
2875	1	gt did no one teach them treat others how you want to be treated disclaimer im not defending just answering the question        a lot of men that partake in that behavior ie playing gameslyingetc do so when their honest approach doesnt work the guys that do the whole jumping straight to sexual matters without establishing any type of connection that is actually them treating women how they wish they were treated
2876	1	this is it people know they just want some token person of color to give them the ok so they can use that to justify ridiculousness the problem is that white people and those aspiring to whiteness have no understanding of the word no culture vultures to the extreme cause the price of whiteness as it is is usually some severe disconnect from your family ethnic identity and you have kids who dont know who they are bringing up their blackness from their great great grandmother or something as a fun party trick
2877	1	i did too now i no longer take it personal but i definitely keep my distance those who can control your attitude and demeanor have power over you if their actions and words can affect you im just glad i realized that lesson and moved on
2878	1	and taboo gets certain people off look im not here to say what he is into its socially acceptable or correct all im saying is that it is his business and that labeling someone as problematic for a private kink isnt justified that is kinda where i stand on it
2879	1	gtwhy do we treatrespond to them like they are truedo we thoughone of the most prevalent stereotypes about black people that i run into is that racism is all in our heads and were making our own problems this seems to assume that is true i dont think it is

2884	1	that is very powerful does it feel like something inert or something you have to forceconvince yourself to do does it come naturally
2885	1	we arent all black to white people thats the problem light skinned or mixed black females with a certain look to them are treated completely different in society than darker black women with a certain look to them thats not just a black thing there are tons of white people who feel much safer around lighter black people that means the two groups can have different experiences in society it doesnt mean they do but the possibility is there because one is openly more favored than the other
2886	1	yeah just remember the unofficial favorite song of reddit is toto is africa that is all you need to know really

2908	1	raises handalso clueless about what it could be how long do you talk to them before they lose interest
2909	1	yeahthat is a lot to deal with i remember an ultrasound tech having a surprise talk with me about fertility during a rough time with a guy i was seeing it hit me in a way i didnt expect
2910	1	there was a vegetarian sub i was following on here that literally made a whole ass post about animals being treated worse or on the same level as slaves the white people doubling down on that stupidity made my eye twitch and i had to let that sub go
2911	1	damn thats one thing about the comic books theyre very depressing than the movies i hope marvel doesnt do that we need better portrayals of black marriages and black men treating their women right in the media
2912	1	but at the end of the day i dont see why i need to explain why relax my hair to anybody i also dont get why i need to explain this to someone ive met only 3 times for under 10 minutes i dont watch what someone else does to their hair so i dont get why someone watches mine and i dont have to explain shit to anybody it is my body my hair my choice i dont get why whether i relax or wear it natural needs to be explained either way as you can see in my post its a battle because people will make comments about my hair no matter what
2913	1	understood
2914	1	venture out when you can youre probably not going to find older women just hanging about in your college town at least not ones that itd be appropriate to date

2916	1	gt well be supplementing that education at homei used to hate extra lessons growing up it is saturday i want to kick it and watch cartoonsthe whole ninein retrospect im so glad my parents did that you cant totally leave it up to the schools oh no all those sleeper classes and no homework nah uh
2917	1	gtthe reason why some play games with the entourage of women they have in rotation is because this life that they have is beneficial to them they want to focus on their career on their time they want to have their independence on their time they want things to be easy for them in their life emotionally mentally romantically etc and also in today is age they are raised into believing that sexual activity is connected to their manlihood and how they behave with certain women is a reflection of that so the guy who you wish could text more could call more could listen to you more etc all that jazz of course he knows that and he knows that he should but it is frankly easier for him not to but they still like what you could offer them so they try to keep you regardlessthis they genuinely do what they want they really arent complicated
2918	1	yeah sounds like a joke to me too
2919	1	i had a straight white friend prior to a hook up with one dude pretty much every guy she had been with didnt go down on her or only would if she did the same
2920	1	if you want to vomitdie
2921	1	it doesnt matter if you talked about megachurches as a whole they still have the same needs if not more than small churchesgti come from a family of pastors and preachers and am intimately familiar with church budgets large and small and what it requires to run a church even one with very strong branding as well as the time they put in this is off this topic but i dont believe for one second that john gray puts in any more time or effort than the pastor down the street who makes a middleclass salary and drives an average middleclass carare the pastors down the street owners of megachurches as well are they all full time pastors if you come from a family of pastors you would realize that all pastors have a different lifestyle with a larger congregation you actually do have to put in more time and effort it is only logistics small churches have the highest burden but that is only because they have few members who cant do many things and fewer members means less money with bigger churches there is more maintenance and costs just because you have a middle class salary doesnt mean youll be driving a middle class car my mom drives a luxury mercedes benz for crying out loud but she didnt even pay the original price for it she just happened to get it for a good deal this doesnt apply to his case but it can apply to other pastors as well youre not the only one thats capable of getting a macbook for 500 a pastor can do that too gtthis is the problem if this is what is going on it is how you know a church is sliding away from its christian mission and into entertainmentthat is literally not entertainment if he was out there singing a drake song to get people to come to church you would have a point but this is strictly about spreading god is word why wouldnt you want to use your the size of your congregation and your church name to get your message out there even my pastor used to put his worship services on the local channel in the area is he going away from his christian mission too what do you make of pastors that just want to effectively get their message out there i feel youre being hyper judgmental here because you want to overcompensate for people like him perhaps you should become a pastor instead all you can do is focus on your relationship with christgtyes they do i think youre misrepresenting how christians operate how megachurches most often function and ignoring what i said christians have to stop this not all christians defensiveness when one of us messes up and own the issue if not black christianity is headed down the same road as white evangelicalsdid you not see people like me in this post denouncing what he did do you actually know many christians in real life too because christians do denounce what he did there are christians that dont care but that doesnt mean youre the only special one that is enlightened with the truth that sounds condescending to others i am not ignoring what you said misrepresenting how megachurches operate and misrepresenting how christians operate christians are not a monolith someone like you should know that you cannot tell me that saying not all christians are a monolith is the same as saying not all christians when people like him do these things people judge christianity as a whole and it affects the image of the church worldwide if we dont say things like not all christians then that will affect the effectiveness of the evangelism of other pastors who dont act like him it is not the same as being defensive you can still criticize his actions while recognizing that not all christians stand by him the church has to overcompensate nowadays because of people like him so of course people will say not all christians you should reread what i wrote especially in boldgtthe people you see in the media are the worst of the worst examples there are plenty of churches especially big churches that give back to the community but those churches dont get enough attention its actually harder for smaller churches to give back to the community because they dont have that many members and therefore money megachurches are actually better in a way unfortunately there are pastors that abuse the system but that goes against the word of god and other members of the christian community do not stand by them the church is not a monolith theres so much pressure on churches to go the extra mile for their members and their congregation and sometimes the congregation isnt even grateful or if they dont do enough or even too much members or visitors will complain its tough to maintain a church and i feel like the general public doesnt know thisso it is justified if people get defensive because they dont want to be associated with that and because people make generalizations even you why do we only give attention to the bad examples and not the good examples it is terrible and counterproductive to the mission of the church ive never seen a good post about the church on this or any subreddit it is only the bad things we should absolutely call out pastors that are not acting appropiately but we should also spread the good news by highlighting the churches that are doing right by god we can do both things
2922	1	ive always found when people defend bria myles on this topic they go straight to her body lol of course its her bread and butter but im probably just biased since someones prettiness or ugliness has nothing to do with their boobs or ass or waist for me and in my head you can also be pretty with the body of a surfboard she looks okay to me tbh i live in the south so a lot of women on the every day look like her here just without that extra i have money factor im also very here for people championing her as gorgeous since lightskinned basic looking women get called gorgeous every day just because they have a fat ass

2944	1	yeah i think this is what really messed me up at my last job everyone had this thing or competition i guess where the more people that wanted to fuck you the more popular you become needless to say i wasnt popular as i dressed like a stud lesbian and all the people at work thought that was weird and unladylike of course it played horribly on my self esteem as no one acted like i was of any importance and treated me like i was invisible i thought of changing my look wearing make up girly clothes high heels etc just to show people that i was fuckable i just preferred to dress a different way anyway it didnt matter as everyone at work was sleeping with each other and having all these hook ups and i was just on the outside looking in i work somewhere else now but i keep thinking about how i went through high school in a sense twice and failed both times lol but i agree i dont think romantic relationships or being the sexist person alive should determine someone is worth i just feel that the things ive learned that truly make us happy kindness gratitude community service arent valued as highly as being attractive to others well sorry for this little rant but thanks again for listening and providing me with kind words
2945	1	what do you love about being single if i may aski just know so many women or people but i know more women that jump from one relationship to another with little break in between them they said it is because there is stuff you can do in a relationship that you cant do single like cuddling sex romantic getaways mostly while yes being in a relationship is important and i placed a lot of work into obtaining one even more than i have in my career or school or anything else i mainly only participate in activities that causes me to meet people to date and hope it leads to something else
2946	1	how is that my only options where im from are either wm or bm because thats all thats openly available
2947	1	thats what i fear i think shes a better alternative but that doesnt make her a good choice gonna be interesting to see who else announces campaigns
2948	1	i browse the stocks and investing subreddits all the time but dont really post anything ill probably start though i think the idea of cryptocurrency is cool but i wouldnt invest any money into it that i care about losing because its pretty high risk the thing about crypto is people tend to panic and sell because of how volatile it is thats understandable but high risk means potential for high reward key word being potential though always remember nothing is guaranteed a lot of the kinks are still being worked out when it comes to determining the true value of crypto if that makes sense its being overvalued right now if you want to invest in it be prepared to invest and hold it for awhile dont sell because of a few bad days if youre the type of person that gets really nervous about losing moneywhich is healthy and youre risk averse it might not be for you and thats fine i also dont think your very first investment ever should be in cryptocurrency if youve got the extra money to do it go for it however please do your research beyond the crypto subs and beyond reddit in general
2949	1	i have not because i dont think that would go well
2950	1	theres a lot of stories in the south from the elderly who detested female figures working for white men or associating with them along with that issue a lot suffered from physical abuse and emotional unstable fathers which caused black women seek help from the government and other sources and also caused a new generation to be born entitlement a lot of men in this era believe they are entitled to a lot of things and compare themselves to men in the 1900s to try to justify their actions and decisions the mental and physical abuse continued from slaves to newly freed slaves on down and each generation grows weaker with the influence of the outside world and having to compete with other males from different faces men can have a toxic trait that was stemmed from slavery theres nothing we do about because it is simple will power but it is not simple because a lot of men dont realize nor want to change i saw some women on here said well men need to do they are but only so little are actually doing something about it our generation is filled with mentality ill people matter fact they suffered so much theyre dying out weomenare dying in the hands of white organizations hospitals food industries cosmetic industries childbirth etc men are dying from from being mentality unstable superiority status aggressive and spiritual health theyre wild out there which is why im bringing it up our children are next

2955	1	im not entirely sure if that myth is even true i was watching quite a few vlogs of black girls being in italy and they said the whole italian men being into black women thing isnt entirely true several vloggers had said this and they said italian men just go after any woman they are attracted to also sidnenote i took a look at your profile and i see you teach esl abroad i would definitely like to pm you and ask you about your experiences
2956	1	this is so true i still remember working at a leather goods store and while a manager watched the young black kid i caught the white granny in the back popping security sensors off
2957	1	yes have worked in retail before i still stand by what i said we all have an impact on the world no matter how small our voice is think about the holocaust hitler did not do it alone think about slavery jim crow and the system of racism that we exist in right now major human rights violations like the holocaust happen because people like us the everyday people didnt stand up speak up or do anything when they felt it was wrongthere are many ways that we can respond when things arent right it doesnt mean getting crazy and yelling at your manager but something as simple as asking why is enoughwhen we sit in silence and comply we become the system we complain about if youre unhappy about the casual racism that your boss is making you exhibit why are you providing your labor why are you allowing your body to be used to perpetuate racism of course it isnt just you its a system but the system is made up of individuals all contributing to the system
2958	1	i dont think he waited or anything according to an article i posted a few months agohttpspopulacom20180831itwasliketherewasafogintheskyonlyicouldsee they doubled the deportations of immigrants from subsaharan africa in the first 9 months of his presidencyreally hope your friend and their community are doing okay

2961	1	we got one as our governor thanks desantos
2962	1	she is i said it in the post too
2963	1	since im mobiletrash i cant make this as pretty as i would like but i read a really great analysis on trollxchromosomes yesterday from one user who read the case file and ill link it so you can read it too and another user who ended up agreeing with the sentence after first being opposed the first user made this comment under a twitter screenshot of the convicted girl i totally agree with the overall message of this but i think people could have picked a better case study if you read the actual case file on cyntoia brown i did i dont think her sentence was that out of line she had priors a history of unstable behavior her testimony changed over time and this case looks a lot more like she robbed and killed a sleeping dude than it does selfdefense if she had killed the 24 year old who was allegedly abusing her sexually and physically that would be one thing but the guy she actually killed she never even claimed they slept together he took her back to his place she shot him while he was sleeping and then took his money rifled through his stuff and took his gunsi just think there are so many cases of injustice in the justice system that i dont get why people are highlighting the cyntoia brown case i definitely have sympathy for the girl who had an insanely rough childhood and has a personality disorder and potentially fetal alcohol syndrome but shes unstable and violent to the point of murderedit also if youre going to downvote please tell me why you disagree id be curious to hear because ive read the case file but read none of the other media surrounding the caseunder her comment was a thoughtful and wellfounded reply by another user condemning the tendency for people to assign perfect victims to especially children in sex trafficking its an important conversation i agree with however she didnt know anything about the case other than the screenshot posted and didnt have any other information she said essentially i think your perspective is an important part of a conversation that ought to happen and it shouldnt be silenced so without reading about the case some of your comments seem problematic all on their own specifically the fact that your argument seems to boil down to the idea that a teenager who has a history of sexwork isnt a victim a teenage sex worker is in many peoples minds a victim by definitionno kidding she had priors she was a sex worker no kidding she had a history of unstable behavior a teenage sex worker is almost guaranteed to come from a background of sexualphysical abuse which will lead to unstable behavior you even admit that background no kidding she changed her story that is super super super common in rape victims that particular point of yours comes across as especially ignorant but all of it is real victimblameyabuse abuse abuse rape prison that is the totality of her life and a lot of people arent ok with that it seems like you disagreeand then there is this is this really someone we should be defending  making a big deal of yes absolutely yes this perfect victim mentality needs to die screaming it is people like her that are the most vulnerable but since they look bad often due to all the abuse theyve suffered we dont want to help themthis is of course not to mention the fact that teenagers cant consent to sex so what he was going to do was by definition statutory rape and then were going to say that what an abused teenage sex worker did to an adult man who had every intentions of raping her that should condemn her for the rest of her life to be segregated from society fuck everything about thatalso as other people have mentioned there is a huge discrepancy in sentencing that rubs people the wrong way further using words like unstable behavior to describe marginalized female victims in an attempt to turn them into perpetrators is something a lot of people have very little tolerance for female victims lash out sometimes after years and years of abuse and they get labeled crazy or violent or unstable the people who victimized them get to look like victims themselves while we demonize the unstable woman or girl who had finally had enoughoverall your comment just comes across as a lot of victim blaming with a big scoop of perfect victim bullshit thrown in like i said at the start you could be completely correct in your overall assessment for all i know i knew nothing about this case before reading the comments here the first user linked the court case httpstncourtsgovsitesdefaultfilesbrowncyntoiadeniseopnpdfand the second user responded with thisafter reading the entirety of the court is decision in your link i have to say i agree with the ruling it is not their job to retry the case and based on the evidence and arguments presented i think the court is reasoning in denying her petition was soundsure she should have been able to present evidence of fasd at trial but that doesnt rise to the level of proving actual innocence as required and while i agree that automatic life sentences for juveniles shouldnt be legal unfortunately i dont think she proved that she was denied due process i just dont think any of her arguments met the legal standard required for postconviction relief  even though imo 50 years in prison is absurd and a miscarriage of justiceoverall id say she is a good example of a lot of problems both in our justice system and in society as a whole and although i cant say that i would have convicted her based on the evidence the appeals court is ruling was justified i mean i can think it is morally wrong and also legally kosher at the same time
2964	1	it definitely has helped keep me somewhat sane im also at an age where i naturally seek for other people is opinions outside of my parents and family
2965	1	ironically black women are dating outside of the race the problem is they are  the least desirable women like he said so that impedes interracial dating
2966	1	im not a party person either
2967	1	i appreciate you thinking of me gt in one survey whites reported that they would be unlikely to purchase a home that met their requirements in terms of price number of rooms and other housing characteristics in a neighborhood with good schools and low crime rates if there was a substantial representation of african americansthis tells us everything we need to know about america it is the same deal with the study that says a white job applicant with a criminal record has a better chance at a job than a black applicant with a clean slate
2968	1	i am not raising anyone this is perfectly fine to talk about in a space about black issues it doesnt belong in a space specifically for black women is issues youre not going deep youre just going off topic
2969	1	gti most surly dont play games by dating or befriending a person who was directly responsible for the deaths of over 500000 people and that has never publicly made amends for that choiceas much as i get this she honestly didnt either her dating advice still holds up
2970	1	im glad they work for you but so many of my type 4 sisters feel that something is wrong with them for not being able to just wash their hair and put a few products in it like that its pushed as something thats quick easy and simple which is not the case for a lot of ppl especially living in an arid climate i think we can agree that no style works for everybody though
2971	1	say boo you are good enough be happy even if they call you weird or crazy
2972	1	i think it was a poor decision that he was never gonna win because of optics alone but him being biblically wrong is a slippery slope to argue is all im saying i wouldnt have done it simply because it looks bad but if he didnt use the churchs money im indifferent on it spiritually financially i think its not smart whether he is a pastor or a rapper cars arent good investments and i hope one of his followers doesnt go and finance a lambo like an idiot cuz john gray did it
2973	1	no worries and thankyou  in that thread it is meatier because i put in some foundational informationthat is one issue with communication across cultures and it doesnt necessarily mean ethnicity  there are things that many may consider rude that others consider normal  a lot of black comedians like dl hughley and steve harvey mention what their kids learned from their friends and how they put a stop to it  so my parents would explain why things i learned from my friends were rude my pals and their demographics feel entitled  i included the entitlements in that rather meaty overview i also lead with the tldrit is often said that black women are aggressive no we are raised generally to be leaders spin this in your favor by getting to know the lay of the land
2974	1	oh yeah forgot about the better moderation
2975	1	it really is it used to be funny to me but now its really weird so many people pretending to be black
2976	1	no need to apologize i get it most ppl will use the hut as the go to to show how their africa is not as poor etc and each time i feel like interrupting with a drawn out excuuuuse meee lol i also think it is important to explain the difference between village and city like you did because it is true the entire country isnt huts i feel like often people dont care enough to understandwe stayed in the city when we there but my mother made sure to give us the village treatment as well lol
2977	1	i think it gets talked about a lot but i think there are a lot of women in their 20s and 30s here that is when people usually start pairing off people should be focusing on it imo having a partner is a major life decision that can impact our lives in every way and it is something that most people really wanti think a lot of people come here to vent so that affects the kind of conversations we end up having but to be fair dating is a pretty difficult process it sometimes comes across as a bit much and i get tired of the poor unwanted black woman stories but being desirable is an important part of dating especially in terms of getting what you want i wish we could talk about actual strategies though not just stuff like xyz doesnt like me because im too black etc
2978	1	and katy perry with dark hair
2979	1	am i going to regret clicking that link
2980	1	yesss its so stressful i had time to prepare but i didnt lol
2981	1	lately ive been wondering if it is just me or if other people are settling quietly
2982	1	o_______o but plantains are the best thing ever
2983	1	so did you meet him online or was it in person at a cycling type eventmeeting
2984	1	my boyfriend went out theres service at his church tonight so he wasnt present during the conversation but once he gets back i want to know his perspective for sure i regret even having that conversation i wasted my energy for nothing
2985	1	oh they do had a friend who always talked about how he stole from the grocery store often and never got caught like yeah because theyre probably too busy watching black people instead smhand no he wasnt lying id seen stuff hed stolen before sigh
2986	1	i heard he smells bad all the time lmao
2987	1	by public service you mean govt of canada related jobs is there alot of technology related jobs in this field ive always wanted to work in that industry  because of the job security
2988	1	a recipe for a skin to skin virus youll be alright  promise
2989	1	i think it is black owned
2990	1	gt white womendo you mean white menand i agree
2991	1	lol no mulan and shang are both chinese everyone in the movie is chinese except mushu
2992	1	thats terrible i have no idea why a mother would act that way
2993	1	i gave valid reasons why i think into the spiderverse was an amazing movie so you can infer i have similar reasons to liking black panther the best
2994	1	youre definitely httpswwwindependentcouknewsbusinessanalysisandfeaturesroyalweddingfamilyhowmuchukeconomybenefitscostmeghanmarkleexpensea8345436html right  they help create 18 billion pounds  23 billion dollars of tourism last year
2995	1	and still probably some spanx
2996	1	just movies and if im being guilty honest chilling adventures of sabrina
2997	1	gdbees work is so adorable
2998	1	i live in boston what are you experiences here with black men i feel like i mostly get complimented by them especially older black men theyre really polite to me hold open doors call me sister etc i feel like its been pretty easy to even befriend some really chill black men in certain circlesspaces that are more open minded too like art scenes and what not
2999	1	yeah im older but it is the same thing here a lot of our groups are segregated by age or within a meetup group there will be agespecific meetups
3000	1	my family is bahamian which i believe was columbus first stop where he killed the taino people there i think very few descendants are still there of course slavery was also brought to the islands theres a big beautiful statue of columbus in front of a government building in the capital city it blows my mind and saddens me
3001	1	lmao i commenteed on the weekly thread and its a shit show theyre being exposed
3002	1	idk who downvoted you because this is an excellent response fucking reddit yo
3003	1	she was there for the same reason that there are so many nonblack nonwoman and nonblack woman lurkers here black spaces especially spaces primarily frequented or meant for black women are seen as open to everyone let her get box braids and just hope she dont come crawling back to yall when she wake up with all her hair on her pillow
3004	1	while hope still remains i do believe that the current leader took the country at least 10 steps back which makes me think that to get to a stable zimbabwe will take much longer than everyone including the international community had hoped even if leadership is to be changed the transition to a zimbabwe that the citizens want is still a generation or two away
3005	1	i have so little patience for these people when theyre older i think i just kind of brushed it off when i was in my 20s and early 30s now i just cant
3006	1	that is weird is there a video on this i cant imagine why her hair would fall out unless she did it way too tight or somethingthey of course should not get relaxers though i saw the video of that girl who tried one and most of her hair fell out when she rinsed it out
3007	1	exactly at most ive met her 3 times and have had less than 10 minute convos with her if this is a serious concernquestion for her she could ask me this once she knows me better
3008	1	cerave does feel amazing i think because i live in the caribbean and its pretty much always hothumid my skin is like girl no
3009	1	i dont know most women with implants manage not to date and defend rapists so maybe it is just her
3010	1	to answer your q i didnt ask if it was about men i asked if it supported men theres more black women than black men in the united states theres more black women that works than black mentheres more black women in school than black mentheres more support groups for black women than black men shelters areas for jobs home groups etc i asked because going to a local feminism reddit or i believe askfeminist they took in and comfort from what i assumed white men based off certain stories and how they were treated by certain women who im assume is white i understand that in other countries i should have been more specific and mention the states onlyand hon my studies is on a whole different level i research about us as a whole bc its apart of helping my family out i dont have the time to research that but i do have interests if you dont want to provide a link a message hell a key word on google then you dont need to tell me what  i cant expect im not asking for an essay here black men are oppressive in their own way definitely but it does not compare to white oppression and what i stated isnt only racial oppression but gender oppression as well it needs to be talked about because im pretty sure a lot of mothers are raising sons and need to be pointed in the right direction its scary to raise black boys in this society if over 40 of juveniles are black and hispanic and if the true intended feminism is only for black women what are the views on raising black boys
3011	1	good advice
3012	1	agreed  stay strong
3013	1	who was the bot user you saw well take care of that asap
3014	1	that would be amazing omg
3015	1	why do you a newcomer feel like you can dictate what this space can be used for

3017	1	that is my line of thinking i also finish my 2nd master is in may so there is that as well
3018	1	yup they think theyre too good to say hi or acknowledge your presence
3019	1	awww thanks i used black and green yarn and braided it into my hair like i usually do when i use marley hair
3020	1	i dont expect every black person to be my ally at work but its sad to see them go out of their way to make me the opposite
3021	1	thanks
3022	1	now that i read more about it i love the concept ive seen a number of people especially those who are walking their dogs peek inside and take a book
3023	1	gt people in many different marginalized groups have reclaimed words used against them see gay men using the word fag women saying bitch and countless other examplesis there any other examples i want to use this agrument but i struggle with comparing nigga to bitch because nonwomen can still use the word bitch depending on context that comparison lends to there being a context when nonblack people can say nigga  fag is also weird cause it is also a common term for a cigarette outside the us
3024	1	then he apologized anyways did all that and missed out on an opportunity for what
3025	1	i accidentally saw her in concert this fall i dont like her music nor anynewbody else is music bc im old and crotchety and stuck in the 90salso i think she is dumb and her values are off but i found her cute and charming and i really really dont know why i dont get it so im pretty troubled about the fact that i kind of like her
3026	1	yay
3027	1	this is what putting your anxiety on others looks like imagine being both insecure and selfabsorbed ugh
3028	1	and another thinglet is not act like men dont already hit on women when theyre in gym clothes or even at the gym so this idea that just cause she was wearing gym clothes she didnt seem open is bs to me
3029	1	i typed stuff but ill come back when youre finished
3030	1	lol my bad i quickly forgot ignore my comment until then
3031	1	a friend who is chinese grew up in atlanta and moved to sf and doesnt like it he talked about antiblackness going on in sf visited a couple weeks ago and it seems like a nice place to visit but id hate to live there
3032	1	in the eeend that is what i found out
3033	1	are you gonna buy the pokémon game
3034	1	are you gonna play the pokémon game
3035	1	it wont be so much extra lessons as just encouraging a home culture of curiosity and exploration small kids learn best through play so well encourage that and when he gets older well try to encourage him to explore things that interest him try new stuff build new skills challenge himself and generally live an examined life and of course well go to museums and stuff especially if there are dinosaurs
3036	1	actually i think volunteering is a great opportunity to meet new people as it is a social event it was the wrong place wrong time for her i dont think its out of the ordinary
3037	1	calling these rants pointless divisive and pathetic your words is far from pointing out the individuality of black men lol
3038	1	try it youll feel like that girl
3039	1	oh no no im not the one writing the newsletter lol i wish maybe one day further down the road we definitely could stand to see more of us in sales or advertising that is for sure
3040	1	youre welcome not everyday you bump into stories like yours this was fun and it made me do a little thinking
3041	1	he is the embodiment of toxic masculinity in every way
3042	1	nice enjoy the new ride
3043	1	i get trying to do whatever small part you can but i think a lot of vegans lose perspective and think they are going to personally save the world   but youre right what is the point of a vegan lifestyle if that is where you end it like more is always better and this moral superiority thing in the vegan community is pretty disgusting
3044	1	that sounds fun
3045	1	yes strut
3046	1	youre welcome i love talking about this kind of stuff so im glad i could help
3047	1	lol it is but im probably just super picky when it comes to personality and intelligence and more flexible with other traits
3048	1	will do also apple cider vinegar rinsessoaks  i learned the hard way i need to soak any hair that is going on my head
3049	1	4 days is absolutely no bueno especially if you tried to contact him as well its simply not a healthy way to address conflict in a relationship
3050	1	big mouth is theme song is about the only part of season 2 that i can stand degrassi
3051	1	folks up north drink that shit lol  i  said what  i  said  coke will burn a hole in my chest tho
3052	1	gtthat is actually them treating women how they wish they were treatedbrotha i get that but why cant black men understand that we dont want to be used amp that it is always wrong under any circumstances just like yall dont want to be used for your money or status we dont want to be used for our bodiessex
3053	1	yugioh killed me with those twists
3054	1	ugh right poor lost soul indeed can you imagine how pathological youd have to be to justify marrying a woman like thatand i am living for the fact you called her a creature
3055	1	you need to calm down i think you should read up on the idea of groupthink it isnt just colonizers with guns that perpetuate injustice
3056	1	this is not positive generational wealth growth though this is straight classist 1 kind of shit positive generational wealth doesnt mean you own a lambo it means you have an education help paying for that education home ownership retirement savings etc the community at large does not benefit from this conspicuous consumption and the media attention it is getting
3057	1	her new guy is a registered sex offender  but apparently it was for something back in 1994  hence the ig comments  he was either 1516 when said offense happened

3063	1	when you drink the milk in your breasts at the time arent forever tainted your breast milk will match your blood alcohol content at the time you nurse regardless to what went on earlier in the dayshe is still free to do what she wants but pumping and dump literally doesnt work that way you arent exposing your child to alcohol if you just wait to nurse when your fully sober and milk when nursing at a 08 bac is like the alcohol level of juice
3064	1	i never said they or anyone shouldve known better i just said there are red flags with some abusers 2 i can understand the woman in the article being cautious because she was abused but i still dont completely agree with her decisions here

3069	1	gtbut no one did that soagain do i need to pull up more than 3 posts that are towards the whole bm population im not exaggerating do i need to pull up 10 that talk about bm population on other forms of social media yes people did just because you never seen it doesnt mean it happensgtboom that is all i needed to readneed to read more because the rest of the sentence after that did not make sense as i mentioned other important males in my life who has did nothing but great things to me gtevery black woman ive ever come across that act like black men are perfect and dont you dare say anything bad about any one always has a sonare you missing a sentence or a word here im not fully comprehending the sentence as well maybe say it a different way im not going to say much but just know boys are seeing these upsetting posts that seem geared to their whole population no one specifies anything black men included we just generalize everyone and everything like it is all the same not realizing the harmful toxic words we use to describe one another children are using those words against each other instead of working together just know theres a little girl out there now thinking like you but cant give a reason why should think like that shes just influenced gtfunny cause these same women have no problem oppressing other black women and telling them how they are even though they are women and these women are someone is daughters i dont comprehend this sentence as well either i dont get what you mean by the same women oppressing other black women and telling them how they are gtbut go off i guess were just ol bitter angry black women and black males are so precious when someone mentions a specific sexgender that is what im going to talk about if you make a post right now i will be right with you like any other sister fighting for ours im no bitter black women im pretty sure youre not either but they do exist hence why the title even exist black men are precious so is black women when you look at the stats and you look at the numbers bm are 1 who are unloved however half of them are idiots and brainwashed thinking they can find love with those who admire their complexion it is a never ending game that is designed for bm to desire foreign or light skinned women to replace the bw in order to wipe our black babies out it is the same game but a bit complicated for black women as well we are the 1 whose disrespected i dont feel sorry for some men that get caught up with them they are unloved for a reason and have a low number for a reason shall i explain so you dont assume im not just siding with women shall i also mention the oppression that i and other women suffer as well i can get deep into this because i notice we typically point fingers at one another men have difficulty in certain areas of life as well as women im only mentioning the oppression they suffer and us just creating these posts isnt going to help reply to this i want to see you reply to thiswe already know their numbers are low we already know the good ones need to at least step up to try to defend what is left of them how can these men defend what is right when the media or world dont even care black men arent relevant theyre only relevant that escalates and dehumanizes them we complain that theyre not there when they are why are you not siding with us why must you side with one gender dont we have bad apples in our tree and i mean plenty look at the foster care system woman abusers etc i dont choose sides i mention both the only reason why im mentioning their side right now is because that is the subject men but when a few say not all bad we are siding with them and are downvoted like what the heck

3078	1	sorry it is simplemajority of the blacks in north america have a mixture of native and african heritage some blacks are potentially fully natives and natives are migrants who traveled from different places of the world theres been findings of african tribes migrating to asia india south america including north america some tribes of the americas were described as copper skinned dark skinned wooly hair rough hair then i asked an incomplete question i meant to ask did the people from the islands use the river to travel to north america and what are your resources
3079	1	were here lt3
3080	1	i always wanted to see a tvfilm adaptation of the vampire huntress legend series by la banks you should check them out if you havent already they incorporate a lot of black  african folklore and magic
3081	1	there also would be a huge debate about it
3082	1	thats probably because black women have a lot of spending power and its easy to capitalize off of our well known insecurities its messed up
3083	1	chile im mad you said the whole natural shebang lol i was thinking even on some mixed girls box braids slide right out
3084	1	the sanctions on zimbabwe have devastated the economy it also doesnt help that theres a lot of corruption and selfinterested politicians have taken over peoples farms both black and white owned and distributed them amongst their cronies billions of dollars worth of minerals have also gone walkabout its depressing

3086	1	you know it is the truth lol buying a concert ticket should not be like gambling will she show up if so when will she perform a full set or just a song or two like yeah i get it artists can be eccentric or whatever but respect your fans enough to give them the show that they paid for for many people it is hard to come up with concert ticket money and then imagine how they must feel to wait hours on end just to hear like two songs hell nah i dont care who it is dont forget that the only reason you are a star is because your fans got you there i hope folks get ticket refunds when acts are a no show or just do a couple songs
3087	1	oh good lord where do i begin with thisgtthese comedians make a living off of making fun of everyonesome do and when they do the reception is quite different when the target changes shit on black people and youre just telling a joke wanda sykes a black lesbian woman takes a jab at trump and is literally booed on stagegtthey dont actually have those views youre conflating edgy offensive humor to actual worldviews these comedians do not actually believe in what their saying theyre only saying it because it is funny and will get laughs from people who share their sense of humorfirst of all many of them like pretty mich every comedian who has some dumb outburst like jerry seinfeld louis ck etc literally do louis is especially notorious for how many of his sketches were a persona of him trying to get laid only to learn the guy outside that has been sexually harassing women for years including but not limited to masturbating in front in front of someone without her consenteven those who dont believe these things still create a problem one i outlined above that you decided to ignore comedy draws in bigots because while you can probably deconstruct some aspect of society if you want or just get a laugh you have to then ask why something like a woman being raped something awful and horrific is considered funnygt comedians are not the same as minstrel shows and racist caricatures theyre not going on stage in blackface and calling people niggers that would be ridiculous and a career killerit didnt stop the achmed the dead terrorist when jeff dunham did exactly this and made a routine explicitly over a racist caricature it doesnt stop south park family guy and pretty much every carbon copy adult edgy show that only has diverse casts so they can make sure to cover every race for racist jokes they makegt again youre conflating simple jokes with actual worldviews a person who jokes about a certain race isnt automatically a racists a person who jokes about men or women isnt automatically a sexist a person who makes a joke about a sexual orientationgender identity is not automatically homophobictransphobicracism is not a state of being there is not some single thing you just do that crosses you over a threshold it is a system of oppression that starts as prejudice that then becomes emboldened and solidified through things like economic control legal power social culture and so on it is more appropriate to say youre perpetuating these things and wealthy comedians like kevin hart are in positions of power if they are given celebrity status and this level of reach to act like my post is about how youre automatically bigoted and some evil monster is reductive and ridiculousgt those comedians stopped those jokes because of the rising hypersensitivity of our popular culture this is evidence that pc culture is killing comedypolitical correctness was brought about post civil right movement era when marginalized groups were starting to get more steam in the political sphere the narrative had to shift from people just being shitty outright to instead using their free speech so the narrative was reframed to paint critics of bigotry as just hypersensitive political correctness started as a term making fun of hypersensitive conservative christian types complaining about how rock was satanic or something it then redirected to people in positions of privilege mostly white people but certainly not limited to them who felt uncomfortable over the fact that theyre being expected to not call people slurs among other thingsas a result turning to things like storytelling entertainment and yes comedy was a solution because it is considered just a joke or a story something in a sterile vaccuum that doesnt affect anyone in their eyes if youre unironically using terms like sjw and pc culture youre invoking the last 34 decades of conservative narrative quite casuallycomedy is bringing a laugh but why would gay people get a laugh out of being shat on in a country where donald trump exists even better these were twitter posts not a comedy sketch so this isnt even a performance meant to entertainbeing a decent person and not shitting on gay people is not being hypersensitive it is groups of marginalized people tired of constantly being shat on by every aspect of society kevin hart isnt being thrown out on the street he is declining literally one job if i start going on about how women are worthless sluts at my job id be fired in an instantgtjoking about rape does not mean the comedian condones rape theyre not shitting on people when they make those edgier jokes all theyre doing is trying to make people laugh i never said they condoned it they trivialize it again you have to then ask why someone being forced into sex for someone to feel power over them something that largely goes unreported and is something that affects countless people is something that you see as laughworthygt theyre not laughing at minorities theyre laughing at the joke nothing more and nothing lessuntil they draw in a crowd of people that literally does laugh at the minorities this is why characters like uncle ruckus in the boondocks are criticized sure there is something to be said about how there is a culture of self hating in the black community brought about by white supremacy but most people watching it love him because he shits on black people and makes racist joke they are absolutely and explicitly laughing at the minorities and a creator has a responsibility to know that this happens becuase it is happened time and time again bojack horseman even calls this out as the idea of looking up to shitty fictional characters instead of seeing them as the garbage they are is thoroughly deconstructed in season 5gt you saying that comedians shouldnt make jokes about rape women and minorities is proof of sensitivity killing comedy youre sensitive about those issues and dont want comedians joking about themim not sensitive about those issues im just not a dick of course i dont think comedians should joke about rape it is not funny i sincerely hope you or anyone you care about never has to deal with something like it im a guy i might be a minority and in a position of being oppressed but my being male is also quite a privilege too if you ask right now im certain at least more than a few women on this sub and plenty others have either been raped almost raped or had familyfriends who haveeven in the off chance they didnt it is still a serious thing and trivializing it to this degree is disgustinggtwhat is not fine is when people like you try to ruin comedy for more thick skinned people by ostracizing their comedians and promoting this cancel culture we have now if a comedian is able to keep up with a joke for four decades that only means the joke works it means the audience is stupid as shit and that they get a new audience and new generation of peoplegt  if a comedian makes a rape joke and there is a rape victim in the audience why should heshe care they dont know those people personally plus if a rape victim who doesnt like rape jokes goes to the show of a comedian who makes rape jokes it is their fault for spending their money and attending the show without properly looking that comedian up beforehand i also believe that those hypersensitive people shouldnt be seeking out offensive comedians if they hate that style of comedy you wouldnt eat a ghost pepper if youre highly sensitive to spicy foods so why would you seek out an offensive comedian if youre hyper sensitive to offensive comedythat is some victim blaming there i dont even know what to say about this a comedian should 100 care about their audience because that is why theyre entertaining in the first place those are exact talking points used when rape victims come forward so the fact that you dismiss their thoughts here and now is troublinggt on the other hand if the rape victim doesnt mind rape jokes then there isnt even a problemif you like the joke simply dont seek out those types of comediansthe idea that people seek out these types is also disingenous ive never watched kevin hart but that doesnt mean what he says isnt a problem we dont live in a vaccuum and being mindful of things around us that dont even necessarily directly affect us is important  i dont watch south park but that doesnt mean that the millions of people who do watch it and get their shitty views affirmed or get crappy takeaways like racism being a mild annoyance at best or making money off making dick jokes about gay people isnt a problem that is a pretty selfish attitude of yours to havegt white people arent the only ones making the argument that pc culture and sensitivity is killing comedy my central post is specifically about black comedians im well aware of this white people men and straight people arent the only ones capable of upholding white or male supremacy or hetero normalcy that is a fact as old as bigotry itselfgt hell im not white and im still a staunch believer of nothing being off the table when it comes to comedyand at this rate youll grow up to be a fine clarence thomas ben carson or uncle ruckus because woc are still capable of upholding the status quo i didnt want to bring this up because i try to avoid directly focusing on individuals but youre an 18 year old woman and your ignorance is showing big time i hope some experience really helps because youre bringing out some really harmful views here you really dont need to go up to bat for wealthy comedians like kevin hart they dont give a shit about you and nobody else will entertainers need to step their game up instead of falling back on their own shitty outdated sense of humor
3088	1	gtsame i look back and cringe too but at least were in better places nowyeah i still regret contributing to that dynamic but ive grown and moved on that is all you can do
3089	1	thanks
3090	1	honestly just let black women vent without turning it into a spectacle and writing a hundred different thinkpieces on it lollet black women vent without calling it pointless and divisive challenge 2k19let black women vent without diminishing the repeated patterns of behavior that prompts them to ventlet black women vent without invalidating their experienceslet black women vent without telling them to just ignore the problem
3091	1	yup
3092	1	gtbecause theyre still fucking losersand they know it the ones who are screwing them over on an hourly basis arent vandalizing a thing because they know theyve won ampx200bgt white supremacy is one big ass tantrum from some big ass babies why i dont deal with light racists why am i wasting my time on stunted adultsampx200b
3093	1	im literally saying ive heard a lot worse about religious black girls than just black girls im actually shocked you people here act like youve never noticed that
3094	1	i love kpop ill pm you my discord so you can add me also subscribe to rkpop if you havent already but you probably have
3095	1	i didnt think about the skin tone but you are right wonder if that was done purposely that could also be flipped on it is head though as in the movie featured strong empowered black women having to make tough choices and have we traditionally seen those types played by darker skinned actresses and not lighter ones so nothing new idk i do know having viola being married to liam is definitely a visual we have not seen and bringing race into their relationship re viola is jabs to him using race when they were fightingim not from chicago so i was wondering what people from there think about it yes the politics and social aspects of it but also small stuff like the beauty shop scenes was where i thought about it the most like the owner had kind of an accent and attitude and i was wondering is that specifically chicago or just black women lol im hoping people will appreciate it over time i definitely already want to see it again
3096	1	i personally love the comment trying to squeeze in an inspirational message gotta love their determination to disprove structural racism by helping prop up those same structures
3097	1	uh its not disingenuous to do that at all you can do both things criticize pastors who are greedy and talk about how people need to maintain church finances theyre all relevant because people treat pastors like theyre not human and theyre not allowed to have valuable possessions like you and most people dont realize that a church like his needs a lot of money to function you werent saying anything when people were crying because churches were tax exempt and they are simply misinformed if they think churches are simply money laundering schemes and that is what im talking about
3098	1	truth history education is so deplorable in america its essentially white supremacist propaganda whenever anyone is skeptical of institutional racism i just point at american history classesunfortunately i dont think too many households are educated enough to pick up the slack which is a tragedy seeing as history can be an important tool for building a confident self identity and knowing how to deal with current challenges
3099	1	he just looks like he is reaching his full form to me i believe he is been through the black girls didnt like me phase joking about racism phase getting a career leg up from a racist and abusive white woman phase and is now partnered with a nonblack woman and making hits for white people if white attention or approval is the goal he is made it
3100	1	this makes sense im still relatively young 23 and recently got out of a bad longterm relationship so i can see that im negatively biased ive been putting tons of work in on my mental and physical health so those are two large areas for me i see your point
3101	1	gt im only bringing white feminism up bc that was what inspired me to ask the questionand that is the problem im sorry but not sorry you say youre not ignorant of who their are but their behavior still inspires your examination of black behaviorgtq another assumption ive known we done it longer i just dont know the detailsyou should spend some time looking them up then they explain why there is nothing for us to even be inspired by in their movements gti didnt compare i gave an opinion and a view of what i saw in their community which once again lead me to ask questions what do we do with our men in this movement i mentioned them on one thing only hey guys i notice white women take men in you assumed based off that im comparingyou made a literal comparison here gti asked for a comparison and a comparison is what i got they got theyre stuff going on over there what is good with us gtand if i did good googily moogily my apologies because my approach wasnt intended to compare but just give a brief statement of what went through my head to ask the qi get that but it is no small thing we have people inspired to question us based off white women is behavior enough as is with our hair language bodies and behavior we definitely dont need one of us doing the same thing
3102	1	schadenfreude against another black woman really
3103	1	word
3104	1	excuse me
3105	1	i cant speak on southern because ive never been down there but my experience in the pnw i lived in seattle briefly was that its subtle friends felling me theyre glad to have me there because im different people touching my hair like im a petting zoo people who claim they understand white privilege but get upset and defensive when you point it out as its happening i never got called names but it was things like being shushed when i wanted to talk about race relations there were times where i would be discussing racism with white folks and they would talk over me and not even realize that that in itself is a form of racism it took me awhile to make real friendships over there because there are so many white people in the pnw and very few of them are actively fighting racism i dont have any white friends not because im entirely against white people but i just havent found any who are worthy of being a part of my life
3106	1	lol
3107	1	let other subs mock us if they want isnt this supposed to be our space to discuss all things that pertain to black women im not gonna let prying eyes ruin that
3108	1	i love this on you
3109	1	gt it is sad and telling that you compare your religious leaders to worldly entertainers who havent made any vocational commitments to godit is sad that you dont want to hold public figures accountable and you are twisting what im saying again i also hold celebrities like lebron james accountable for what they do because theyre public figures that have influence and should be role modelsgtif you actually believe this as a christian we dont have much more to talk about all ill do is ask that you read james 3 specifically verse 3 though the whole passage is goodperhaps you should reread it gtjesus made clear examples in his life and his teaching around the importance of walking away from wealth that doesnt equal a vow of poverty but you can only make the defenses youre making if you ignore huge parts of who he was and what he taught please look up his teachings on riches and especially mark 10jesus teachings on riches are that you must prioritize the kingdom of god above all else not that you must reject all riches even jesus didnt reject all earthly possessions he still had clothes and food if it is so important why dont you quote it here so that we can all learn from it since youre making the claim plus his teachings apply to us as well youre sitting in a warm room typing on your fancy smartphone or laptop and you want to say that someone should avoid all worldly riches when that is not what jesus taught regardless of occupation gtyou should also ask yourself why you dont like this and why youre so defensive since theyre supposed to be held to higher standard have a nice day i dont like it because i think it is ridiculous that people expect pastors to live in poverty without valuable things you might not have said that but your replies are agreeing with what i said because you keep bringing up jesus teachings about riches when he never said you should reject all earthly possessions even pastors
3110	1	thank you  honestly i was surprised lol cuz i definitely walked in that salon in jeans chucks and a sweatshirt
3111	1	muito legal
3112	1	control  i dont know  she wasnt forced into the situationshe chose it and both she and her spouse seem keen on using that power in more edifying advancing ways for marginalized peoplesand have already in ways the old monarchy never would have  you could be right but ill wait and see what the results are  i remember diana holding babies with aids and walking through mind fields and just how much of a ripple effect that had in terms of public sentiment and tangible changesupport  these two seem keen on a similar path
3113	1	hells yes thank you
3114	1	that would be awesome
3115	1	that too and such a combo resulted in a love letter to an extremely toxic stereotype
3116	1	i just vomited
3117	1	oh if you saw the movie youd get what im talking about lol def go see it if you havent especially if you have young kids its a good introduction for them on what the internet is and how to use it
3118	1	organized churches was stemmed from the original oppressor to encourage the black male to connect with his population with slavery and white religion this was and still big in our communities those are not real organizations that willed by the power of him himself to encourage black men to do better black men now days typically dont attend to church women populate that gtblack men have each otherim sorry highest rate of killing is black men on black men the mass dying and excluding themselves further from the us a small majority are doing so due to the lack of support itself if you read my comment majority of our men are in prison and bonds than free and no debts black men who are righteous do not have enough supporters and hell the black man in general do not have supporters either are you grouping all of them together
3119	1	no clue it is been a little over three months since i had him and the swelling started up again like a week and a half ago it is been really persistent the swelling has been constant during that whole time
3120	1	shit i might even want it for myself lol
3121	1	great point
3122	1	huh im confusedare you both black
3123	1	this sub is progressive we do not allow homophobia transphobia or any other harmful opinions here there are women of every possible sexual orientation that participate here and to let homophobic views be expressed here is damaging we are not and never have been about free speech here if we were the sub would be filled with white people calling us racial slurs that is how the first black girls sub died a painful death we moderate strictly here and we always will
3124	1	i noticed that too and had too look it up theres a good fan theory behind it
3125	1	oh really  what did she do
3126	1	exactly where is the punchline for any of these jokes the people endorsing crude jokes cant even explain what makes the jokes funny  they just arent if a comedian is so basic that heshe has to put someone down use someone is cultural differences skin color sexual identity their sexually traumatic trigger  things that they dont even have control over  then maybe heshe comedian just an asshole and not actually a good comedian it is ironic how some people will use darvo and still double down on their opiniondeny  oh i they wasnt being racist homophobic etc  direct quote from a poster above joking about rape does not mean the comedian condones rape theyre not shitting on people when they make those edgier jokes yettt they also said that it is literally a comedian is job to be offensiveattack  youre just being sensitive you just dont know how to take a joke who cares if someone is offended by what i say direct quote from a poster above  what is not fine is when people like you try to ruin comedy for more thick skinned people by ostracizing their comedians and promoting this cancel culture we have nowreverse victim and offender   people are making a big deal out of this it is not my fault people dont find it funny  theyre just looking to be victims and something to be mad at direct quote from a poster above they dont know those people personally plus if a rape victim who doesnt like rape jokes goes to the show of a comedian who makes rape jokes it is their fault for spending their money and attending the show without properly looking that comedian up beforehand
3127	1	lmao im just imagining them sitting their diligently taking 1520 out of each pack of hair
3128	1	right i took an african america literature class this past semester and my teacher did refer to the lack of bootstraps which made tons of sense but holy shit when i saw that video his message was insanely clear of course i had a dream was extremely significant but like you said it abbreviates all his work and thats unjust
3129	1	yes if we cant talk with each other honestly where can we ever talk these things throughyes we may be angry and hurt but were processing those emotions so we dont repress the hell out of ourselves and learn to move forward with this stuff cause being black in america is hard im done pretending to not be human and struggling with things just because it is a downer to someone else
3130	1	oh perfect i was fullon nervous because text is tricky that way thanks again for your thoughts have the best day
3131	1	i dont understand why it is so hard for you to understand that women have to deal with sexism and racism but all of your responses act like sexism somehow wasnt a problem because racism was worse in the past than it is today that is illogical and wildly inaccurate wildly
3132	1	even accounting for that absurd basketball scene this entire thread is going to give me an aneurysm lol
3133	1	someone pointed out to me that his face is missing a lower jaw and now i can never look at him the same
3134	1	omg ur so on point can you just do the research and write the show pls
3135	1	gt imagine being that bitteri wish that bitter word didnt exist yall use that shit for everything but the right thing
3136	1	i got these in black httpsmjcpenneycomparizonawomensdenmarkwidecalfridingbootsblockheelzipppr5007671106ptmpltyperegular  and these in chocolate httpsmjcpenneycomparizonawomensjonescombatblockheelzipbootsppr5007669526ptmpltyperegular theyve been going fast loool
3137	1	alright thank you i really appreciate the information like i said im not all into politics so i really dont get every bit of information about everyone thank you for educating as opposed to ridiculing
3138	1	it is interesting that you said something about facebook groups being a meeting place i met a guy from morocco in a vegetarianvegan group he wants more but having been burnt by experience money was involved unfortunately im taking things slow he doesnt mind it
3139	1	if youre plant based girl theres a lot that is one thing in common
3140	1	gt by women keeping it strong nearly 4 generationsyep and weve done enough it is somebody else is turn to step up now
3141	1	basically i have the same thoughts younger is definitely better and i dont think it is ageist to think that
3142	1	gt i dont care about ir relationships as long as you are not pathological about it i believe the gentleman she might be alluding to is the one who proposed to a antiblack white woman who says the n word god bless him for his choices  he is going to need ithad a good conversation and good laugh with my so about this those past tweets were disgusting not just saying the n word  but joking on black names black skin comments about going back to white men because black men are xyzwhat a lost soul he is sharing a bed with a creature that vile says everything about how he views himself
3143	1	seconding this i went to urgent care and was surprised to learn they had an entire gynecological room they did all my testing and exams
3144	1	they look so great and seem better on your hair than braids how long do they typically last for you honestly 8 weeks is probably the soonest id want to take anything out
3145	1	just to be clear i am not trying to say neither but ill answer your questions anyway from my understanding different definitions opinions etc if it means to involve a child of any sex constantly around black women empowerment only i dont think it is a good idea i dont think women should raise children by themselves due to stress work etc but i cant tell a woman how she can raise her child especially if she is not harming him if she is empowering his blackness and masculinity and empowering her blackness motherhood and femininity if you choose to be then i dont see an issue what is an issue is constantly forcing your child or using feminism improperly gtwe should always raise black boys to treat women with respect and treat women as equals never disagreed
3146	1	because 6 years ago he was a comedian
3147	1	they do which is why the con artists who lead these megachurches made up a whole type of gospel to try to defend why they are so corrupt moneyloving and wealthy prosperity gospel my ass
3148	1	i certainly get what youre saying for me its being in threads and reading the as a white person  i guess if theyre going to be here i just rather them not participate id like to pretend at least this space is for black voices
3149	1	yeah part of the reason men like him keep this behavior up is the general idea that other women can make them cheat or lure them away or that someone who isnt in a relationship somehow hold some sort of responsibility that is what i want to see end
3150	1	ive been saying somalian for years  that is what the kids i grew up with called themselves damn let me hide in this bush for the rest of my life
3151	1	study tips1 handwrite all of your notes during class it is a pain but it really makes a difference my freshman year one of my professors banned laptops in class because of a study that showed that students perform better academically when they handwrite notes instead of typing them three years later i still handwrite my notes in all of my classes i find that i need to study less when i handwrite my notes because my brain retains the information better2 dont cram do a little bit of studying everyday the day before an exam should be a day of relaxing and getting your mindset right for the exam not stressing about all of the stuff you dont know3 when studying aim for understanding not just memorization if you can effectively explain the concept to someone with no background in the topic and give examples that is when you know you really understand and can move on4 do outside reading go beyond the class readings watch some documentaries or videos on the topic i find that it helps me make connections between the class discussions and realworld applications i think this one is easiest for me because i really enjoy my major and i find it very interestinginternships1 start early for summer internships a lot of the applications open very early in the spring semester sometimes even earlier do your research and make note of the application deadlines2 bond with your professors find a professor on campus who has experience with what you want to do get to know them and make sure they know you you may need a reference or letter of recommendation one day maybe they have connections in the industry that they can you connect you with and dont think that the professor needs to also be black to connect with you in my experience my biggest cheerleader is my advisor and professor who is a white man3 apply only for opportunities you are actually interested in interviewers can tell when you arent actually interested and your enthusiasm will come across much better in interviews you are excited for hr people like enthusiasm and willingness to learn also apply even if you dont meet all the requirements you never know4 look for diversity programs and fellowships for your major for those interested in media check out emma bowen and t howard foundation there are many major specific ones out there as well5 network start cultivating your linkedin early i started mine my freshman year connect with everyone you meet professors classmates friends parent is friends etc you can use linkedin to meet people at companies you are interested in ask  for informational interviews lunches or coffee when looking for people to connect with for informational interviews look for someone with something in common with you like alumni from your college alumni love to pay it forward because they were once in your shoes when industry professionals visit your school to speak to students go to the panels stay the whole time and meet the speaker at the end6 speak about your dreams to anyone and everyone you meet talk to your uber driver the person sitting next to you on the airplanebustrain home from school family members and family friends closed mouths dont get fed keep talking you never know who knows who and can connect you with people who can help you7 get involved on campus and have leadership positions yes you can put your campus involvement on your resume as experience8 take a resume and cover letter writing workshop if your school has a career center take advantage if this sooner rather than later become a pro at tailoring your resume and writing compelling cover lettersmy familymy family is mostly african american not immigrants my grandmother was the first to get a college education and became a nurse which broke the cycle of generational poverty for my family theyve been upwardly mobile ever since her children both attended college my aunt is a doctor and my mom is a business woman ever since that generation there has been a wider variety of paths taken we have media professionals and journalists in the family now
3152	1	i am glad you had a good experience im so used to hearing folks say they had to wait hours until she showed up then she just did a few minutes seems she is trying to do better and respect her fans more
3153	1	yeah i think were on the same page let me say though that these people absolutely could fix the park the whole point of our meeting was to reallocate funding that otherwise just wouldnt be spent and likely lost to fix it but that would require actually advocating for the neighborhood so this vegan didnt want to do it not eating cheese thoughthis was an example of someone with the power voice and privilege to effect change but without the drive
3154	1	im glad i could share something good and thank you ill check the service toolkit too

3157	1	gtyeah but some just follow along with it who is they the white people or usofc i mean the white people lol but now that i think of it it applies to black people too cough yeezy coughgtyeah but when we echo this we get exploited negatively not to mention theres been numerous of times we try to give whites a chance but they end up twisting our story to fit their narrative which often leaves a negative stigma amongst black people especially black womenthat is true it is a delicate issue that is hard to solve gtbut they end up twisting our story to fit their narrative which often leaves a negative stigma amongst black people especially black womencan you give examples of this happening im a  relatively new user anyway ive only been here since the summer and i havent been more active until recently
3158	1	yes yes and yes whats your content about in yt
3159	1	gti sat there remember all those times when i or my mother tried talking to this man who we had encountered and been around for more than five years at this point and how he would act so awkward around us like he didnt feel comfortable talking to us his wife was much friendlier it rose suspicion that he might have a bias towards black people unless they are from haiti and he can talk to them about doing missionary work in haitithis kind of thing is so infuriating how does he allow himself to be around people for years and never get comfortable with them how does he do missionary work in a whole country full of black people and never get comfortable i cant
3160	1	fair point im a canuck as well and public service is the dream loli just dont want you to worry too much about exposing him it will drain you ive been there and ive watched mediocre and less than mediocre coworkers ass kiss their way and take credit for work incl my own to the top plus you can run the risk of being perceived as another black women workplace trope   the bitter black woman
3161	1	zoey 101 drake and josh american dragon jake long
3162	1	it doesnt suck because theres zero need to focus on people that hate youit is what it is
3163	1	lol weird
3164	1	one plus perhaps the only one about growing up with caucasian guys is a few of them were like brothers from other mothersd how much money do you make me welldnever mind it is not enoughr heres what you say to your boss to get about 20 moreme  that will never workr do it thank me laterdarned if it worked and i got almost 25 more
3165	1	from the mom part or the target partbecause what mom did was tough
3166	1	exactly i thought a lot of my white friends in high school had my back when it comes to this but they quickly showed their true colors and threw me under the bus
3167	1	i didnt know there were white jamaicans i mean i figure there is probably mixed jamaicans but actual white jamaicans too
3168	1	yes
3169	1	im planning on participating in the annual swim in senegal next year   httpsyoutube_3znao0pfe4
3170	1	i feel like she is on a holiday though so i dont really care
3171	1	i have the most insane story ever related to this
3172	1	rblackfellas is bs
3173	1	agreed is it really a protective style of your hair spends more time in a wig then it does out and maybe if these weaves were more kinky curly and mimicked black hair i would agree that people are making a big deal about this but when you really sit and think about it it is odd that the standard is to glue or sew in silky straight hair i really think its important for kids to truly love their own natural hair and its hard when all the baddies on instagram are rocking a 24in peruvian and yes other races do use weave i wont argue with that but do they use textures that are so different from their own
3174	1	yes but our school system sucks its 96 european based our children are already struggling in the homes the education doesnt build on them at all it actually discourage them to want to learn bc all they hear is white people that british discoveries this i really think majority of us should homeschool and if mommies and daddy work a family member or a group that can help fund our own education i know we can do it  our people are meeting up from all over the world just to building a foundation i see it on facebook a lot but sadly that isnt something that is shared millions of times
3175	1	i never heard about that donald glover thing i went to an hbcu for grad school so i was kind of isolated from all of the traditional hbcu culture to be honest im not sure it would have been my thing i kind of liked undergrad at at pwi there was a small community of color everyone knew each other and it was just easier to make friends you automatically belonged somewhere i felt like i got lost at an hbcu i didnt know how to make friends or connect with people because that had always happened automatically at pwis it turned out ok i guess  i made fewer friends at howard but the friends i did make are much closer to me than my pwi friends maybe because i had to work so hard to find them
3176	1	i cant do my own makeup either lipstick mascara and eyeliner are my gotos it made me feel as if i failed at being a woman happy to know that this is not the case at all
3177	1	i think you guys take things a bit more seriously compared to tanzanians at least that is how i think most tz people feel i dont really think it is a big deal but i think we are bit more laid back
3178	1	gt view the memorialized suffering of black people as a form of nostalgiacan you say confederate flag it is our history
3179	1	im surprised someone knew lol a lot of people love to say slavery doesnt exist not to mention theres another clause that promotes black poverty
3180	1	we dont want to date racist white men  or nb men either yet we arent always discussing them and who they dateand this isnt just oh dont date him hes racist this is going into why black males do what they do and imo giving them a soft passdo we really need to discuss the why if a racist nb man calls you a racial slur we never try and discuss why he might feel that way
3181	1	you right i always try to give people the benefit of the doubt even though every time i am disappointed
3182	1	im american and none of my family does even younger generations if they use it it is kind of a sanitizer or something
3183	1	well most of the black girls at my school are not ghetto at all and are very well mannered and articulate lol including myself but they dont take bullshit by they dont yell or fight either i wear nice clothes and try to make myself look good in the aspect i shop at brandy melville thrift stores for nice jeans and hollister just for an idea of what my sense of style is but i dont wear makeup except lipgloss sometimes because i suck at it but i do have clear skin and i have a decent body like im not overweight or anything not that theres anything wrong with that but i think im too tall im 5859 ish
3184	1	gt i could rant about this foreveri feel you i just had a premature baby recently and man do i hate the system even more than ever now
3185	1	let black woman be black women
3186	1	i havent had my chance in the movement so i went there to get a view of a white perspective with my own eyes i am not using their behavior as a standard for my expectations i dont even have any expectations because i never done anything to contribute yeti asked for a comparison and a comparison is what i got they got theyre stuff going on over there what is good with us my expectations by being a black women in general doesnt even come close to their expectations im highly offended by this comment
3187	1	spicy white
3188	1	exactly i like that last part maybe one day itll happen for me but if it doesnt it wasnt exactly on my bucket list it also helps that this is my favorite time of year so its really hard to be down when theres music lights festivities family and food
3189	1	i have never wanted to dm weirdly enough i dont really want to be in charge of the adventure id rather participate in it ive got all these characters i still wanna make that is pretty much the exact same as me when it comes to first time  i loved the story aspect and i was good at the roleplay part but the battles wiped me out because i wasnt entirely familiar with the rules of fighting plus my first dnd game was with 5e which apparently nixed a bunch of rules that used to let you do cool stuff      ampx200b
3190	1	just want to say that your flair is amazing and has me cackling
3191	1	i was just wondering if i should make the drive uguntherstankbooty will you be there
3192	1	she did an interview with amy shumer about how she sat next to him at the met galagti was sitting next to odell beckham jr and it was so amazing because it was like he looked at me and he determined i was not the shape of a woman by his standards dunham said in a chat with amy schumergthe was like that is a marshmallow that is a child that is a dog it wasnt mean  he just seemed confusedgtthe vibe was very much like do i want to f it is it wearing a  yep it is wearing a tuxedo im going to go back to my cell phone she said  it was like we were forced to be together and he literally was scrolling instagram rather than have to look at a woman in a bow tie i was like this should be called the metropolitan museum of getting rejected by athletesthroughout this whole scenario that played out in her head she never once actually talked to him that night
3193	1	keep your head up  you wont work there forever  im sure you aspire to bigger and better things in life  get through this season by being kind to others
3194	1	because i understand on some level that i probably love my skin color in part because society also seems to like it its like a white person realizing they like being a white in a way and feeling conflicted by that
3195	1	its not an opinion black is a race
3196	1	farrah was definitely not prettier she legit could not sing dance and was causing problems
3197	1	gt it is only relevant because we know the priceexactly if it is so ostentatious or presented in a way that we know the price that is a big indication that there is a problem gthowever my point is that you shouldnt be hyperjudgmental of leaders there is a balance and it goes both ways you sound like youre trying to overcompensate for the greed of the church but in doing that you misrepresent everything the church stands for and you even take bible verses out of context jesus never said a servant of god could not have jewelry or a carim not im actually giving gray and a lot of pastors the benefit of the doubt especially since i know what can and does go on in that worldbut it doesnt go both ways they made a choice to be leaders not the average christian if anything im underrepresenting the greed of the church there is a lot more that needs to be cleaned up and john gray is just the beginning please show me which verses i took out of context or where i said anyone cant have jewelry or a car gtif he buys a mansion and a yacht after this then yeah okay but this is just an isolated incident as far as we know he doesnt buy lamborghinis regularlya lamborghini isnt a 500 ring it is such an extravagant purchase that it is a big enough incident to be a problem on its own scale matters and you seem to want to ignore that gtthe problem is youre being hyperjudgemental and think a reddit post is going to stop christianity from becoming like white evangelicalism you shut me down when i said not all christians are a monolith as well we can criticize pastors but we can also hold ourselves accountable when being judgmentalim honestly probably giving him too much room and am probably more aware of the limits of the internet in relation to changing the church than you are i dont dabble in not all christians excuses and have no shame in holding leaders to higher standards if you do that is for you to deal with  gti question you if you think pastors cant have jewelry and a car that does not go against biblical teachingand i question why you keep trying to minimize clearly extreme purchases as if theyre your average jewelry or car but i think you need to keep the conversation muddy to avoid making an honest critique of pastoral behavior ive had these conversations with pastors who live decent lives they arent complicated
3198	1	i wish i was
3199	1	its so absurd that anyone would look at her and think shes ugly in what dimension
3200	1	right and im so glad ive only been called chocolate once and then he was like actually youre a carameli was like cool bro
3201	1	no boooboo you do it a dictionary gave me the same result toohttpsiimgurcomvpbzot5png
3202	1	miss j is just my favourite person on earth always i am him and he is me
3203	1	i tried but two of my other coworkers beat my to the punch there has to be at least one of us there so i lost
3204	1	this should be top comment omg like are these black men literally stupid by that adherence to hierarchical racial logic white women should be serious with white men only and retain black men only as a sex toy or when they get too old or fat which is exactly what happens with those with sense but theyre too stupid to realize it sometimes black people are just so damn hopeless like damn
3205	1	oh yeah very true cerave is def better in more arid climates
3206	1	that didnt go down so well last time but if we did it would need to be women only and limited to users who have proven to be here in good faith
3207	1	they both live in my area and the guy on instagram i know in person i live in the twin cities
3208	1	yo that looks so dope
3209	1	from what im understanding you rather celebrate when our fellow sisters and brothers help to make our own community betterhence you stated schools those that teach our history shops that are black owned government black dominated hospitals black createdbasically anything blackran and dominated not by the white manyes we should look out for each other but for those working under the white man do you not think that they are making impactful changes to the black community to help benefit usblack teachers advocating for a change in how we teach history black doctors contributing in diminishing the health discrepencies among our pplnot only do we need to help each other but we need to educate and converse with others in order to make a monumental change trust me people out there working for the white man are not concerned about what they want they are out there steadily trying to positively impact and influence the black communityyou should be proud of both we need both
3210	1	same
3211	1	they sell them for 20 at my local walmart for some reasoncraziness
3212	1	i never downplayed anyone struggle i gave 3 examples that are common in our communities then said we all have unique stories that are physically and mentally hurting i didnt say these stories will not give them some type of hope but honestly how many will see that we have success stories every day but the numbers dont change for the better it actually increases poverty in our areas
3213	1	do you mean soft cups i used to buy those and now i cant find them anywhere
3214	1	i get it i just feel like overall it is been over blown to be honest ive been disrespected more by black men than white men but that doesnt mean im going to automatically assume black men are more disrespectful than white men it just is what it is some men are trash and some are great
3215	1	im obsessed with reddit ama is id support that
3216	1	i took a yoyo when i was little i didnt mean to steal it i just didnt understand how stores worked and thought my dad had paid for it or something i was 34  my dad made me come back and give it to them announcing i stole it i still feel guilty about it
3217	1	thanks will do
3218	1	thats true there were times  i have to remind people that i am an adult because i would get talked down to as if i was a teen
3219	1	the only possible response to this fool
3220	1	yeah it is weird i feel depressed almost 247 like it is a constant mood for me yet when something stressful happens to me i was fired recently from my last job i had to transfer schools because i didnt have my scholarship money anymore i was in a bad car wreck once i almost feel calm relaxed almost and like i can actually breathe it forces me to hit the ground running and i dont feel as suicidal anymore despite actually having a good reason in those moments i dont know why but i feel more pain and heartache being single than i ever did in those moments
3221	1	what do you mean by your last paragraph what mind mentality
3222	1	bdsm can be problematic just because it is consensual doesnt mean that it is nonviolent or undeserving of critical reflection
3223	1	videos of it are all removed from youtube but here is the joke httpsiimgurcomdl1eejpgand yes he actually does say nword dickinterestingly he kind of supports ms labia is assertion on twitter that it is all about power dynamic he is also said in his lyrics that he likes sistas but they dont like me which also stirred up some controversy as well as saying he likes asians like a lot he has sorta cooled down on a lot of that in recent years though
3224	1	understood
3225	1	what is bwe and where can you find women groups
3226	1	yeah and honestly i think a lot of the women defending him want that kind of life even if they have to tune out the voices of congregation members who cant pay their light bills
3227	1	thank you for updating my nosy ass
3228	1	the title is literally im tired of black men lmfao this is not trashing
3229	1	i really didp
3230	1	thank you
3231	1	true maybe im defending them because i did a profile on this company for a college assignment but the story behind it was inspiring it was started by a black woman cathy hughes and she built it from just one radio station to be the biggest black owned media conglomerate their reach is crazy and they own literally every good black media outlet out there
3232	1	right he will definitely live
3233	1	that sounds awesome
3234	1	i didnt have plans to but is it good i just got ssb zelda and mario kart
3235	1	it is hard to say anything about the situation without projecting another perspective on the situation to the kidi agree with this post  in time if her dad continues to see her regularly  shell start noticing things on her own and put two and two together  as for how to talk to her about what is going on with her parents the line in the post above about her parents being mad at each other seems the most neutral   it really isnt fair for him to turn her against your friend like this  im sorry she is going through this  this articlehttpdivorcehelperorg201704talkkidschildsupport has some tips on talking to kids about cs  but it sounds like it may be best to let her tell you how she feels without saying much about it  at least that way she is not hurting her mom by lashing out at her my mom had to out my dad on cs around this same age  b hi t she was also talking to me about household bills and what things cost by that age  so i had enough info to know she needed to do that  my anger with her came from my dad not coming around when they split  and me thinking she was keeping him from me  maybe if you hear her complaining about not seeing him you can counter that  you know explain to her  your mom would never stop your dad from seeing you or doing abc for you hope this helps
3236	1	im 100 sure some people would still say ha well youll still have it easy some people be thinking im getting a full ride to harvard just for being black
3237	1	thank you lt3
3238	1	ive been looking for a space to talk about this type of stuff freely didnt know it was women based but when i read in the guidelines on family depending on what it is i would consider it as family because we are all in the statistics im not looking for any debate mess that is all i seem to find lately and although i want to talk about women issues i cant forget children and men issues either especially if im married to one and have children black boys and girls i find it highly alarming how my sons friends know nothing about black women rights or black men rights i just want a place to speak on both no wonder folks came in this all tight i ruined a space  but didnt mean too
3239	1	isnt it only white people and a few black men and women who basically just dont want to be respectful to other humans who say that
3240	1	oh no it is a typo haha
3241	1	i live in houston and i care nothing for beyonce i keep my unpopular opinion to myself out here
3242	1	dont knock short dudes until you try em when theyre confident oh my lord
3243	1	consider yourself blessed and highly favored
3244	1	it is unethical and illegal to take organization funds from the church and use it to buy things for yourself so whether it is 20 or 300 it is unethical unchristian and illegal to take money from the church and use it on yourself i can spend my money on whatever the hell i want to and let me tell you why because i am not a pastor my job has nothing to do with upholding moral codes living a life of righteousness and walking in the ways of christ while i could spend my salary on hookers and blow if i wanted to the pastor should not if you do not understand the difference between the pastor and a layperson then i am not going to waste any more of my time on this conversation throughout your comments you talk about playing devil is advocate and wanting to know where the line is and blah blah but really you are just being willfully ignorant noone made this dude be a pastor he chose this life for himself he knew what he signed up for if he wanted to drive lambos pop bottles in the club have a different woman every day of the week and swim in a pool of gold coins then he should have chosen a job that allowed for that he did not therefore he will be draggeth on the internetz for making a mockery of christ and for not living the way a person of the cloth should live everyone is not meant to be a pastor that is why you should not be one unless you were called by the lord to do god is work everyone and they mama claim they a preacher now because they see it is an easy way to make money off of gullible people none of these clowns were called if you were actually called to do god is work then you wouldnt be trying to have a church bigger than a stadium drive a lambo or con your congregants into buying you a fucking jet plane that is not what being a pastor is about disgusting that these clowns so worried about worldly riches and ridiculous that people like you are defending them
3245	1	please do ive been seeing lots of black women and girls where i live having all different types of color hair by using yarn or crochet or marley hair etc it is great that there is so many different ways to do color hair now
3246	1	that shit is so annoying ive lurked in razinidentity and rasianamerican or whatever the hell theyre called bc i wanted to know more about the asian american experience and immediately got a headache from the amount of misogyny spewed towards asian women im not asian so i cant speak on those issues but i know the entitled mindset some asian men have is ridiculous all because they cant get their dicks wet when they want
3247	1	maybe do the things you like alone then you can make new friends in the process
3248	1	make him buy the non latex once you make sure he didnt give you an sti hugsampx200b
3249	1	gotcha i want aware it was child care i was in a rushed when i read it so i read it as an extra curricular sometimes that doesnt count because it isnt necessarily a need but if she has all of the information for it she sure can
3250	1	dont be as other posters have mentioned there are many men who are perfectly happy to sleep with virgins that is and im assuming you are a heterosexual woman who is interested in sleeping with menif you were a woman who is interested in sleeping with women again there may be some women who are not into it but there are also some women who dont care especially for people who only realized their sexuality later in lifei say do what you feel comfortable with dont think of your virginity as some albatross around your neck and also dont build it up in your mind as some big scary thing when youre ready to have consensual sex with a partner you will find that personi just like to offer an alternative perspective as someone who didnt wait for love to have sex and was happy with their decision
3251	1	honestly i teared up
3252	1	ggdggffjdddgddhxdgsksksksksk
3253	1	girl it was embarrassing people gossiping and wondering whats wrong with me since we were together so long but he married the next chick and not me
3254	1	yo  im going to check this show out  thanks for the recommendation
3255	1	gtim not just talking about struggles im also talking about the elements of black culture that fall outside the niche that the media has set up for black people im talking about things like education achievement black feminism and insight into actual black lingo besides the trendy vocabulary basically anything that gives a true insight into how black people and communities operate outside of rap music sports and looks is rejected and not given a proper platform in the media and societythis is hugely important not so much for other people as much as it is that our kids need to see our complexitiesdepth out there in the world if they are to understand they have more options than negative stereotypes they need to see representation of those options in the real worldas part of the big picture
3256	1	this my life is 99 wash and go and 1 twostrand twist or twist out
3257	1	i mean black males vent about black women all the time from weave to being masculine and everything else in between i no longer carehowever most of the time theyre never talking about legit negative experiences like a black woman saying theyre too dark or something it is always black girls in elementary didnt want me or white women are willing to submitthat is not even remotely close to what black women talk about but again if that is what they want to do i dont give a shit
3258	1	i cant prepare  well i can but it involves booze positive selfaffirmations and more booze
3259	1	he listened to the dialogue and we described the scenes as they were happening it was nice because it wasnt one of those movies where talking and discussing things while they are happening ruined anything there were quite a few times where i was yelling at the screen
3260	1	that deserved a post of its own tbh
3261	1	thank you for hearing me i felt really alone in that room
3262	1	thanks
3263	1	yup white jamaicans galore white white like burn in the sun white scottish and britishdescended mainly there are also chinese jamaicans indian jamaicans sri lankan jamaicans
3264	1	same
3265	1	i agree i dont get why they care either
3266	1	worked for the government for 5 years the went to law school
3267	1	rblack4black could help
3268	1	gt the first thing that comes to mind is which facts they choose to share or omit you know how people will skate around japanese internment privacy or civil rights i dont trust them to teach the whole story and the teacher has their own biases to account forthat is why learning more about civics would actually help to change that the government is what accounts for what we learn in school including history learning more about how the government works how it should work in a practical sense and why it works the way it does is how you can be a better informed voter or even potential politician that can vote for or influence people to make changes to the curriculum so people get more educated about the things you mentioned obviously you would have to deal with teacher is biases in the meantime but we have to keep in mind that it is not an immediate solution i definitely agree about money maybe individual schools could roll it out at first as a club after school program or elective in addition independent organizations can team up with schools to join students and mentors who work in government positions im just not sure where the push to do these things would come from perhaps there are programs out there that doing these very things if so we as a populace need to support them more it also starts with you and me i suppose
3269	1	yes honestly after that happened i let the white girls take care of them lol i wasnt going to bend over backwards to make them change their opinion
3270	1	gt my friend had a radiant personality and if a guy only liked her for her chest i felt bad for them because she is awesome in so many ways that actually matterthis made me smile and nod my head the way you credited your friend says a lot about you
3271	1	i understand your point but transsexual isnt the correct word transgender is more appropriate
3272	1	im so fucking tired of side chick culture
3273	1	people will literally only stand up for a black man is right to affirm their own bigotry basically plus these were twitter posts not a formal showing he is not getting paid to tweet so even if you wanted to make the he is a comedian argument he is not doing so in this context the idea that comedians can say everything but not really mean it because it is an act is exactly what draws bigots to use comedy to project their views because it gives them an out if theyre ever called out on it he even could have just owned it and apologized but instead he insisted that people were just looking for reasons to be angry
3274	1	eeeh she could but sometimes these holiday parties and get togethers are used for excuses of how involved and a team player you are especially if she is at a young liberal white company they like to be apart of something not just clock in and clock out not going will cause cause problems into nye leaving earlyand being really broken up about itugh gosh guys i have to go shootsokay but just one more saves facetldr less office politics by going and leaving early
3275	1	i agree not every black man has a negative view on black women besides if they have that much of a negative view theyre just close minded and immature
3276	1	thanks
3277	1	can you please show me where he did that everyone keeps saying that but i havent seen where he actually did
3278	1	same sis kpop groups make me question my gayness
3279	1	gt not a big reach when youre getting on a giant soapbox and trying to police what people sayyeah youre reaching going yeah im tired of hearing about this has absolutely nothing to do with moralsgtbecause it helps the black women out there that think something is wrong with themit doesnt most black women when dealing with racist nb males dont think it is something wrong with them hence them not trying to figure out what makes racist nb males tickyou dont need warning flags for racist black males because unlike nb males they will scream to the mountain tops they dont like us gtdid you not see people telling them to go address it on the male subredditdo you not see the bs in that and how that plays back into my point of they dont care why should we do we go into white asian latino etc spaces and discuss why theyre racist lmao no we dont because we arent trying to give them a pass like what is being done heregtas i said you can make a thread about itas i said several threads have been made here about racist nb males and it is not met with this same level of understanding and support
3280	1	gtthere is a lot of internalized oppression hereimblown away nowhere in the original post did they talk about not trying yet we have all these black women jumping out the woodwork to talk about how racism is a frame of mind and how black people are the reason why theyre at where theyre at this whole thread is grossampx200b
3281	1	i love soul food
3282	1	thanks i know her and love her account her style is more on the eclectic side but still a good place to start searching
3283	1	lol that may be true i lean more towards women and theyre definitely more difficult to flirt with for a variety of reasons probably i shouldnt be so desperate but gee so many people make relationships sound beyond amazing i know one girl who barely recognizes other people when she is with her boyfriend like i would be talking to her and when her boyfriend comes over the entire conversation halts and they become wrapped up in each other they even forget certain people are there i even asked her about said conversation  like remember when we said and she didnt even remember me being at the event where we had it it just seems like relationship are like prada bags or expensive jordans where everyone wants one to show off i dont know
3284	1	i agree however rico and megan make completely different music i love all three in my opinion the gp mostly white audience wont care for her music because she call is out a lot of their bs i wish her voice was heard and people gave her the praise she deservesbeyoncé has tried to put some stuff out there with lemonade and it received so much pushback but praise from black folk there was a track she left off of i am sasha fierce which talks about a lot of black issues but she was reluctant to add it because it was early on in her career
3285	1	that is what i thought but it has to do with the mentality more than physical location at times after leaving trinidad and tobago she stayed with her mother in queens since she was 5
3286	1	grumpy zaddy
3287	1	enjoy
3288	1	lol thats funny your good all it needs is a maam he still should have humored u by asking for your card
3289	1	its prejudice against someone with a darker skin tone with a preference for lighter skin tones i guess if colorism should only be used for people in the same racial group it would be just plain racism not sure if colorism is exclusive to that though if so ill correctedit since you edited ill also add that im waaaaay out of high school and very much so into dating since im a lonely pos but this light skinned vs dark skinned preference is so real to me i dont know how black women stay sane maybe because im fetishized for being mixed but even if you find a guy that likes you and you really like him theres always a chance hell come out later and say some foolishness that makes you doubletake
3290	1	gt but getting a piece of jewelry for your wife or buying a car is not a sign of greed this is not a nice piece of jewelry not even a very nice one it is a very expensive and ostentatious car gti think thats your issue jesus still lived like a regular persona lamborghini isnt even close to living like a regular person you cant even say gray fudged the line he blew right past it and bragged about it if a pastor is doing that theyre wrong and need to be looking at jesus evaluating their career decisions and really worried about being judged twice as strictly because of their choice to become teachers  gti think youre being too judgmental here the pastor of my church places god as his utmost priority but still has valuable possessionsyoure not being judgemental enough were supposed to hold each other to account vs people outside the churchgt you should look more at what the pastor is doing for his community and congregation than just physical materials you should look at both you can do good and be exploitative and a poor leader at the same time the very worst most abusive sexual assaulting financially crooked ministers out here did good on the sidegthow are you helping anyone by being judgy wudgy either because our religion is in a mess and we have to step up and hold leaders and each other to account before we end up like white evangelicals that is the whole point of matthew 513gtif a middle class mom can have jewelry or a car it should be okay for a pastorif a middle class mom makes a vow to be a leader and servant of god she gets held to that standard too so you should be questioning her too
3291	1	watch it every year the music is amazing
3292	1	ding ding so i was reading this one thread and this person was all she jeopardized the mission shes whiny she is hot headed and my personal favorite  she was abusive to her soni just sat there like did we watch the same show i can see the hotheadedness only when she goes off on the neighbor boyfriend but everything else ill just stay away from mainstream boards
3293	1	be gone troll
3294	1	makes sense
3295	1	exactly how am i at fault he made a very hurtful comment about my appearance in the middle of a conversation and then started laughing when he saw how upset that made me he then gave me the nonapology of im sorry your feelings are hurt two days later he calls me while hes drunk i told him that i dont talk to drunks and he tried to start an argument before i told him to call me when hes sober and then hung up the next day when we talked and i asked if hes feeling better he tells me that he wasnt really drunk he was just testing me to see how id react i told him that hes acting like an ass he told me to watch my words so i said hes being unnecessarily mean and acting like a jerk outside of him essentially telling me im being punished have not heard from him since if you want to defend someone who refuses to acknowledge that they caused the problem in the first place go right ahead
3296	1	ma im talking about when you are in a store if you can just tell a man is no good but yet you hve women that still would talk to him those types of situations
3297	1	op im sorry but this is what youll also have to look out for i had the same experience as you the nice thing is these assholes usually tell on themselves before even saying hi
3298	1	that is fair a lot of incompetent people are in positions of power i guess my concern is that people let is say asians and whites are looking at us now as if we are on booster seats automatically i had a 93 average going into my stem program at my university i went to school with another black guy that had a 68 i have never heard of a 68avg getting into the university i went to or my program i feel this diminishes my accomplishments and dedicationi dont really want to be hand fed because of my skin colour give me a test against everyone else white out the names and give positions based on thati dont know if i want a black man woman giving me a job just because we are folks doesnt that promote more divisiveness amongst us all
3299	1	do you not understand that different people have different experiences just because you have had the past experience to know a certain man is no good doesnt mean everyone else has
3300	1	like white writers and academics who have no clue about what black people or women are like marketers who want to understand black peoples opinion about things same with political consultantsthey really dont understand us and the main reason they dont know us is their very lives have not depended upon how we thinkunlike us
3301	1	yea hes not the one cutting a check here hes getting one made fuck around if you want to kevin but you cant just say dumb shit and then get shocked when it comes back up
3302	1	that is sad to me because you should be proud when another sister and brother are building shops schools universities homes creating their own government etc  you speak as if their education is worthy to learn no its not that is why a high number of us dont know who we are and what we are capable of youre steady focusing what they think were going to say instead of focusing on our own people or it least benefit the majority of us all i see is they want us this they want us that what about what we need what we need to do in our community i dont consider my community as theres and im pretty sure majority of us will agree to the same thing
3303	1	it is not a false dichotomy do you even know what that is you didnt even explain how its  a false dichotomy jesus wanted  the rich man to give up his possessions and follow him that doesnt mean he wants anyone to give up all their possessions in modern day society he just wanted the man to show his dedication and love for him people like you arent helping the church because you give the church a bad name and ultimately make people drive away from the church if youre so religious and you have all the answers become a pastor yourself youll make the church so much better and again dont say have a nice day when you could care less about my day
3304	1	its on richmond terrrace
3305	1	no one isnt going to hand over a mic to a black man to be listened by millions black women have the connects to connect with higher class women of color and manage to gather followers to be able to educate that type of number another way black women get their following up is from starting at the bottom but that doesnt last long because we immediately got each other cant say the same for black men
3306	1	congrats i have one more final this week and im freakin i just need a c if i can get a c on it ill be the happiest girl in the world
3307	1	what dont you like about it overplayed
3308	1	do it it reminds me of the polaroid i had over 10 years ago just not as expensive
3309	1	oh girl  the latter part of this year has been like this for me  its not that i even talked much in the first place  but sometimes people will say something in an argument that is so anathema to your pov but you when you keep calm and listen to the whole argument you get a better idea of where they are coming from  but still i have to wrestle with how well i am staying true to my beliefs  this critical thinking shit is hard
3310	1	i saw that user name before i started the read and thought oh this is about to be good because that is some top notch creativity right there
3311	1	i know i know
3312	1	with all the issues with that term im just really surprised that of all places someone would use the term females to refer to women here i just thought it was one of those old issues of respect that had mostly been settled between black women it is been years people have been talking about thishttpsverysmartbrothastherootcomwhyyoushouldstopaddressingandreferringtowomena1819180317
3313	1	yeah and it is not really applicable to this situation my reading of what he said isnt funnya joke i also suspect that he would be held to a higher level of scrutiny as a black entertainer
3314	1	im not sure if cancel or call out culture is hurting us i do think it is important to take support away from problematic individuals but some people are getting caught up in overblown scandals and that is the part that concerns me
3315	1	i might be hustling backwards because thishttpswwwamazoncomoxo58081steelcanopenerdpb00004ocmmrefpd_aw_lpo_79_tr_img_213480105545479359_encodingutf8amppsc1amprefridmht0dhpnb5atyr6tzad5 is dollar for dollar the best item ive splurged on it has never failed me and opens the cans like paperdo we need to be investing in a motorized can opener
3316	1	thank you and thats exactly what im trying to weigh i know theres no wrong decision i just gotta determine which one is more right for me
3317	1	gt to me the big thing here is that your friend should have set this little girl straight when she started running off at the mouth at her mom about how she hates what her mom is doing and why you trying to put my daddy in jail her mother right then should have told her to watch her mouth when she is talking to her and then she should have briefly told her that it is grown folks business that her mom is handlingshe wasnt rude when she said it and she is not at all a mouthy child  she really seemed to just repeating what her father told her my friend is trying to avoid keeping children in the dark completely about things in life to tell you the truth so we welcome her sharing her feelings vs being told that she has no say in how she feels this situation is obviously affecting her and it is okay for her to be mad at her mom but we need to help her understand the situation better before attaching her feelings to itthanks for your input tho
3318	1	oh  im sorry about that i was saying that this situation whart isnt applicable to the type of situation im referencing initially what i was referencing initially was a situation where someone gets called out and typically makes one of two responses this situation is different in that because it wasnt that he got called out and responded but instead he was told to apologize he refused etc citing hed already apologized for the remarks if it were me i would have responded differently but i was also musing on the fact that no matter how he responded i suspect it would have been heavily scrutinized based on the fact that he is black in my acknowledgement of this fact i want to point out that im not attempting to defend him his words or actions in any way
3319	1	internet hug
3320	1	thank you
3321	1	ah i shouldve mentioned that we have seriously discussed it we have plans to buy houses together we have purchased vehicles and save together we invest together
3322	1	but many people complain all the time about topics like calculus and history things they wont actually arguably use at least with civics it will lead to a more informed populace which will lead to a more informed voting base politicians already think most people are uneducated as true as that might be so they take people for granted besides i think a class like this could complete what people dont learn in history class
3323	1	i think it is also a generational thing with any minority group harvey is 61 and hart is 39  there is even generational divides among the lgbt community about various political issues  not saying this excuses it but it does show how people of color are maturing towards solidarity rather than away from it
3324	1	will check them out too although baby alive dolls creep me tf out
3325	1	this is controversial i thought it was just the truth lack of twist out skills is part of the reason i now have locs

3330	1	gtit could be my latex allergyyou should definitely go to urgent care to get it checked before assuming it is herpes latex allergy is nothing to take lightly it can mimic std lesions lifestyles skyn is latex free amp is sold at all walmart stores
3331	1	if the church is paying his salary  he shouldnt be spending so much on extravagant shit like this its not a bad thing to want to buy nice things for his family however but it does raise the question of if hes spending enough of his money on the church rather than on expensive cars keep in mind pastors to pay tithes and offering too however as someone whos dad is the pastor of a small church they have to fill in the gaps for where people dont pay thats their duty i dont think theyre paying him a 400k salary i think he probably just used a loan like normal people and is practicing bad financial habits so he could be telling the truth but then when youre dependent on church money for your salary then you shouldnt be buying things you cant afford
3332	1	so
3333	1	youre welcome  btw it is probably alao relevant that they were retired before i was born i bet if they werent id probably have been a real nightmare because they may have soothed me with more stuff  they spent a lot of time with me and i lost them when i was still a young person

3336	1	her innocence and his responsibility for his own relationship arent mutually exclusive  she didnt break up their family violate their love or distract their focus that was all his decision her status as an innocent should barely be a footnote in this conversation stunt or not i wish she hadnt issued a public apology

3346	1	colorism definitely exists and i do believe that it is a problem in the media when dark skinned actors are overlooked or have to be more stereotyped than lightermixedlooking people however i dont think we should spread misinformation and say that the mom has to have had an affair for one child to come out super light looking
3347	1	haha big brother is always listening
3348	1	gtvideo gamesaracades festivals carnivals fairs anything that has some sort of interaction with another playergtanimedont they have functions or conventions is cosplay and anime affiliated with each other if so dress up as one and meet some people youll naturally wing out the ones that is attracted to you by just being yourselfgtastronomymuseum is travel go camping and visit camping sites with friends or something make sure it is a crowd of people take a camera to have an excuse to go anywhere and take photos but still engage in your interests you will find men in those areas everything you like doing go out and do get engage and try to have some fun by yourself and with others so it wont be awkward poor quality men typically stay in one remote area in walmart gas stations clubs etc when you explore and visit places youll gain experience in your interests as well being noticed by someone try to go to public areas by yourself ive noticed men make moves with women that is by themselves by the way im only mentioning this because girl i was like this and i know by keeping your mind on interests and being a woman you will get noticed i dont know how your style is but bold colors artistic touches catches men eyes hopefully you come back on here with a funny story to share muwah keep it up with a beautiful personality

3353	1	same lived it too smh
3354	1	lol you started off this conversation saying you were offended i didnt bother to respond to what you said because you misinterpreted my argument made it into a straw man actually and you really didnt answer my question what exactly did i say that bothered you you just made even more unfounded implications about what i think i never once put black beauty in a box but its nice to see you backtrackpeople hate it when a dark skinned black woman loves herself and her features why dont you talk this talk in the daily threads that black women make on here about how much they literally hate their own blackness about how much they hate their nappy hair and wide nose and dark skin why come into my post with this mess i didnt denigrate any other form of beauty you need to redirect this energy
3355	1	gthopefully we can do like a mid year checkin for progressampx200bremindme 6 months checkin on progress
3356	1	i would not assume its hsv given you have a known latex allergy and were exposed to latex recently you could be right but allergic reactions can take different forms try your best not to panic and wait for your results to come in as for who will date you well you said yourself that 50  90 of people have hsv and there are many informed and compassionate people who do not have the virus who will not let that prevent them from getting involved this does not diminish your worth
3357	1	i second this boundary testing right off the bat is a huge red flag negging you like that immediately is also a red flag you dodged a whole bullet i hope that is something you can be positive about you completely avoided an ass that was going to try to dull your shine and drain you emotionally im sorry that your feelings are hurt at the moment but this isnt your loss at all its very hard to put yourself out there but you avoided a bear trap of a man by listening to your instincts be proud of that

3365	1	this is definitely on the same level as formation every aspect is an aesthetically stimulating masterpiece worthy of being archived in the library of congress it really is a provocatively empowering presentation of cardis genius
3366	1	gtas a sugar baby your sugar daddy will not be doing that for you you will have to listen to him whine complain and talk about his day you will have to be the one to cover his loneliness they do not pay you or give you nice gifts in order to offer you emotional support without even having sex in return im sorry if i sound harsh but i think people need to start being more realistic about sugaring it is not a glam movie where you get luxury bags and vacations just for looking like an older guys eye candy it is work with sexual favors often given in exchange for those perks be sure this is what you really want before you jump in headfirst because you will be very surprised and might even come out much lonelier and sadder than when you went ini agree with the others who say that it is sex work for sure but i dont think there is anything wrong with that between two consenting adults i would sit down with him and ask what he is offering you as well as tell him what youre looking for and what your boundaries are if youre both honest with one another it could turn out to be a mutually beneficial relationship i would read up on escortingsexwork etc so you can learn about things like safe calls and making sure a friend knows where you will be and has his info name car make model license etc a couple of years back i had a playpartner who was kind of like a sd but i didnt know what to call it at the time we never had sex but we did play at bdsm parties etc where i would do things like spank him etc and i really enjoyed that then hed take me to dinner or sometimes he would pick me up on campus and drive me an hour to therapy and wait in the car then take me to dinner afterward we started with him being somewhat submissive to me but he actually wound up becoming a friend
3367	1	they bring millions of dollars of tourism to the uk

3369	1	it never fails they will be calling you in your 20s lying about how they always liked you but were too afraid to say anything when they were too worried about what others would think of you  dont waste your time on people that dont respect you  good luck hun lt3
3370	1	there were one or two people that said it probably to troll andor get attention and practically everybody on black twitter started flaming them
3371	1	he is not right fuck that loser
3372	1	theyre also the same people that would call this whole discussion pc culture on wild had this been in any context of a white person receiving the criticism
3373	1	i live in australia and theyld just call me black
3374	1	i know this is so crazy former refugees
3375	1	lol
3376	1	and blacks just happen to be at one of the bottoms it hasnt even been  100 years yet since slavery in certain places we are still struggling in white america
3377	1	damn its like that in the gay community too i thought it wouldnt be bad in the queer woman culture because i thought women in general are a little more open minded when comes to looks and dating
3378	1	it is but i was going to say the same thing i went to a pwi in middle and college and that is basically how it works i didnt have my first kiss until 19 and it wasnt with any of the guys i went to school withlike it is already been said it is a blessing in disguise though because theyre really not worth the effort boys are notorious time wasters at those ages and you get to avoid a lot of what goes along with that just keep your eye out for being used for friendship sex companionship your brain whatever by guys who will give you what feels like romantic attention while trying to keep you in the closeti do think it is important to find spaces where you do get some positive romantic attention so try to trade off some involvement in the dating scene there for poc spaces or activity clubs where you can over timeampx200b
3379	1	gti enjoy being alone but sometimes there are just things i want to enjoy with people my female friends always have excuses or are always w their boyfriend and hardly make time for friends although all of them damn near live with their companionthis has been my experience and im married my husband and i value our independence and it is been a real struggle when i make single friends they all dissappear once they partner up and it seems like people who are partnered up stop wanting to go out and do stuff wout their sobasically a psa to say remember this if you get into a relationship and make sure that you maintain your existing friendships
3380	1	shrug im almost 30 i can fend for myself could they yes am i asking them to nope
3381	1	i have no problem with people having relationships in their industry or their job most of us have seen an office romanceparasitic relationships on the other hand are nopity nope getting with the boss to hopefully move up or the boss lording sex over someone is head as a stipulation to continue working at their job is not cool
3382	1	i meant it the opposite way he got me great gifts i was honestly very surprised i question his priorities a lot and i still do    but i guess christmas helped me remember that he does try    it wasnt just the money but the actual effort he spent how vulnerable he seemed when he asked if i liked the gifts
3383	1	black men dont cheat is it a joke someone made up a campaign i dont understand what  the movement does or is supposed to do
3384	1	yes kaivent deleon is closest to what i mean thanks for posting
3385	1	gti honestly think black people use the school system as an excuse for not examining why they want to move into overwhelmingly white areasthis a lot of parents have their own classism and antiblackness to work through the schools are often just a front or a part of the price they pass down to their children which is also why i think a lot of those children receive so little parental supporti was talking with my cousin a while back about how wed never raise black or mixed girls her husband is white around majority white girls we both came up in private schools with lots of white friends
3386	1	gti believe a lot of black women are in pain from the rejection weve experienced over our lifetimes so some of us try to hide how not ok we are by being nasty to our peersi think this explains a lot of it were taught to protect white people black men and basically everybody else were still human though and our emotions have to go somewhere we dont have many spaces to punch down though so it gets concentrated where we can ampx200bgtright now im in the process of unfollowing all the athletes in my instagram feed that have shifted from education to thirst traps because that is not what i came there for  im glad it is not just me i noticed myself unfollowing so many trainers and coaches just because i got tired of staring at read views of their sqats im not mad at them for making their money but like you said that is not why i signed up
3387	1	lol they need it
3388	1	silent glo up for me every time i have let someone know my goal i immediately drop it also i have been using the equatewalmart version of the bioré charcoal cleanser and my skin has never been better im literally glowing despite the stress from nursing school i follow it up with the equate version of the olay face moisturizing cream
3389	1	gtno no no  no more excuses  white people are not our stumbling blocks our mindset isyoure personal anecdotes are cute and all but reading this all i can hear is pull yourself up by the bootstraps dont really see why your personal phoenix from the ashes sob story story is useful for most black people we have studies and facts that actually reflect reality stop with this we please you have no idea what another person is situation is it is like people forgot racism is a systematic issue in this thread and all black people are lacking is money were really acting like the biggest barrier is mental it is like trump and kanye jointly hired a marketing team for rbl foolishampx200bampx200b
3390	1	because the narrative is to humanize conservatives who were incredibly shitty people the barryjoe bromance humanized them which was fine because we see them in innocent everyday scenarios and it gives context to themwhen you do that with someone literally oppressing people through harmful policy it erases their shitty actions it is why people idolized mccain and zombie bush after their deaths all it takes is one photo of them with a dog one decent action or any one humanizing thing that acts as a whitewashing excuse
3391	1	yeah they are different artists i gave bad examples but i just mean artists with overtly femininestraight aesthetici saw someone talking about this on twitter but about rnbz i think it applies to rap as well so genres like rnb and rap have roots in traditionally black music like jazzbluesgospel etc and typically white people dont really like that sound but now those genres have shifted to sound more like pop which white people do like this kind of leaves artists like noname out to dry but thats okay she is successful in her own right
3392	1	lavasca thank you for sharing that bit about the horse and your parents i have never heard an experience quite like that it made me feel all warm and fuzzyhere is something youll definitely relate to growing up i met three kids around my ageone of them i befriendedwhose families were solidly upper class but their stories always had a sad side what does an oil family from dubai a famous professional athlete and an americanbased chinese business family have in commonthose kids rarely saw their parents despite having lots of money around them new clothes vacations you name it there was this emotional void in their lives i felt bad for them they obviously had nannies but at least my mom would be home most nights by 6pm and i could count on a hot meal by 8pm proper mac and cheese ftw my neighbor who is also west indian would keep an eye out if i needed anything again i simply cant imagine not seeing my parents for weeks on end in your casefortunately yours remained closeps in college i met a nigerian guy whose family did something in oil though i forget what from the outside his life looked good but i cannot overstate how incredibly busted his moral compass was he is to this day the mental image i see when people from developing countries wax poetic about the level of corruption back homethanks again for storytime your negotiating tips from a week ago and have a prosperous 2019 respect
3393	1	we could but i dont think people would like that people are constantly in their feelings about how we ban people so not letting people in entirely would probably just be more dramatic
3394	1	those statistics have often been adjusted for income education and other factors that would influence what you said there really is a difference in how black people are treated medically very much including how black women are treated with pregnancy gtin summary the preponderance of the evidence strongly suggests that among the multiple causes of racial and ethnic disparities in american health care provider and institutional bias are significant contributorsa possibility raised repeatedly if reluctantly by many researchers this conclusion is explicitly supported by a number of studies in which providers views have been assessed or in which decisionmaking physicians have been blinded to patient race or ethnicity it is further supported by observations of physicianpatient interactions and institutional cultures and buttressed by experiments described in both the medical and social psychology literatures in which professional responses to white and nonwhite patients or subjects are found to differ significantly in diagnosis prognosis and therapeutic recommendations in the absence of change in any other variablegtalmost all studies have limitations of one sort or another limits on the ability to control for the effects of socioeconomic status are of particular concern given the power of the associations between race and income education and occupation in american society but as mayberry and his colleagues have observed the strength and weaknesses of each individual study varythe methodological inadequacy of an individual study may be a relatively moot point in the context of the body of literature that gives consistent findings and in which one study often the more recent may overcome the specific failing of a previous investigation httpswwwncbinlmnihgovbooksnbk220337instead of not worrying about it there should be research and discussion done to help oneself as well as straight up asking potential doctors their opinion on the statistics and go with a doctor that takes concerns seriously and will bluntly say that they will listen to a woman is concerns and wishes above a personal level it would also be really great for culture to change so that black women are getting the best treatment they can be and dismissing real data is actively harmful
3395	1	im still christian but i left the church i dont regret it at all the defenses people are making of this are ridiculous
3396	1	gti asked because going to a local feminism reddit or i believe askfeminist they took in and comfort from what i assumed white men based off certain stories and how they were treated by certain women who im assume is whitei think you need to ask yourself why youre uncritically using white women is isolated behavior as a standard for your expectations of black women is groups
3397	1	gtmost black men marry black womeni hope we can get away from equating black women is dating experiences with black men is marriage choices especially since theyre the group of hetero men least likely to marry within their own race and especially since they tend to date outside their race more as they get more educated besides even if none of that were true black women still have specific and unique challenges around dating and romance and we need room to examine themgtbut we really need to stop with this black women are undesirable bullshiti dont think that is what op was saying at allampx200b
3398	1	that is it exactly and there is something about being in a doctors office that i know at least for me always makes me feel more vulnerable and aware of my own fragility im good doing a better job than normal navigating the holidays what about you
3399	1	i wasnt disagreeing with you
3400	1	herehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkanomqffc0 she didnt know what it was though so i felt pretty bad for her
3401	1	how would you pronounce omena im rolling it around in my mind and it could be a bunch of different ways and when i try to look it up im getting mixed results
3402	1	i stole a hersheys bar when i was 5 or 6 years old  i was surreptitiously eating it  my mom caught me about halfway in  i caught a spanking  she walked us back to the bodega compelled me to confess my transgression and finally i presented the half eaten candy and money to pay for it  the cashier tried to let me keep the candy  my mother said she cant have it because she stole it
3403	1	thank you so much it is hard trying to find selflove so young when ive been seeing girls with such perfect bodies and faces for such a long time im hopefully going to focus more on self love this year and realizing that things can get better thank you again
3404	1	i did it because not everyone here is black and i assumed that not everyone would think i was black for sure but okay
3405	1	i didnt mean it literally only as a conversation ender but i also dont wish you a bad one were worlds apart on how we believe christian leaders should function and be treated and are wasting each others time
3406	1	same
3407	1	yeah you seem to have a positive view of the city definitely skewed lol
3408	1	i actually posted some research about interracial dating the other day and the reasons you stated for dating other black people are the exact reason black women dont like to date interracially
3409	1	lol keep searching for that dictionary
3410	1	thank you
3411	1	yea this one has built in cups i honestly dont have that much boobage so im not worried about not having a bra it actually needs to be taken in at the top though because my boobs dont fill it out
3412	1	i think there is a lot of truth in what you said looking back i think i was scared to break up with him because being single seemed scary at the time plus i didnt think i deserved better than what i had i still struggle with my confidence and asking for what i want but being single is way better than being in a shitty relationship
3413	1	i agree with you but i think the advertising industry has been targeting black women more intensely and more effectively in recent times in the past the industry tried to target all women with the same superskinny european beauty standard so black women were less likely to have body dysmorphia and eating disorders because we had our own standard of beautysocial media has made it really easy for the industry to see exactly what we value and our insecurities plus lately there has been a push for more diversity within the whitedominated advertising industry so they have actual black people giving them insights on our values and standards they have definitely taken it and run with it and created a whole new version of an unattainable beauty standard to sell us stuff
3414	1	tlc is sleigh ride is probably in my top 3 favorite christmas songs list because of left eye is raps
3415	1	i would like to join this club
3416	1	of course some of us have pleasingly shaped bodies  however  i find the time and money spent on fake hairalarming  some women only wear weaves and wigs which can damage the hair and scalp  ok and relaxerslets not go there
3417	1	im saying even a black trump supporter deserves the right to think how they do even if you hate them and everything they stand for them being black doesnt mean they automatically need to think like you thats all im saying
3418	1	why do people insist that black women be strong and unemotional and unbothered all the time we cant even vent or have a low moment amongst ourselves do yall not realize black women are people like real people sometimes problematic or emotional peopleit is not a conspiracy and these posters have been active for a while they arent trolls they just have feelings
3419	1	sounds awesome
3420	1	i interpreted the tweet to mean that when a black person is killed by the cops people believe the cop is narrative without question but when a woman comes forward and accuses someone of sexual assault then people look for any and all proof to try to discredit her
3421	1	gt  shes screening out the type people who come into the forum with the goal of spreading the belief that colorism isnt a problem and that focusing on it is a waste of time and energy chrissie has been fighting those type of people in the comments section of her youtube channel for years she knows how that type of thing can derail the focus of a discussion so she is preventing that altogether by screening them outthat is the ridiculous part though she cant screen people out like that dark skinned people are not inherently people with the victim complex that she wants and not every dark skinned person will have the same opinion you cant put this problem solely on lighter skinned people it is tone deaf and makes dark skinned people look like victims that need to be protected it is very plausible that there are a significant amount of dark skinned people that dont think colorism is a problem either especially because there are millions of black people around the world all with different experiences and emotions if you want black people to be seen as their own unique entities you cant have it both ways and think you can screen people out by skin color basically she wants people with the same thought process that she has and that is all fine and dandy after all it is her forum but that is an ineffective and divisive way to do it she needs to treat her target audience with the same individuality she expresses on her own youtube channel why is she allowed to express whatever thoughts that she wants on her own platform as an individual person yet thinks that her views are inherent to black people especially dark skinned women gtyoure right that the same thing can be accomplished by just having more moderators but isnt it much more effective to just stamp out the problem before it starts already addressed how that is not stamping out the problem you realize there are self hating dark skinned women too right theyre part of the problem again dark skinned women are not inherently perfect people with perfect views that hold a victim complex they might very well be ignorant about colorism why should you rob them of their individuality when she is allowed to have hers that seems selfish  to megtkind of like how its more effective to reduce crime in a community by putting more resources toward education and employment with the goal of preventing crime in the first place than it is to just send in the police to arrest everyonebe careful of your false dichotomies here in no neighborhood does a policeman just arrest everyone then there would be no more people to arrest you can also arrest people and put more resources towards those things however the utilization enforcement and effects of these actions take time to come to fruition the civil rights movement did not happen in one daygtno they dont all think the same but they do have a lot in commonthey have a lot in common but that doesnt mean they all love themselves or identify with other dark skinned women common interests and experiences do not yield common thoughts automatically your rhetoric implied that the goal was to have a place where people think the same not just simply looking the same gtthe goal here is not to create an echochamber its to create a space where people who are similar and face adversity as a result of the attribute they have in common kind of like your fave subs rblackladies and rblackfellasbut that is exactly the goal you dont just want people that think the same you and chrissy want people that have a similar mindset do you think all dark skinned women will face the same amount of adversity even if they do it wont yield the same results for different women some will want to handle that adversity in different ways than other even ones that you or chrissy would consider controversial there is more than 10 dark skinned women in the world again chrissy clearly wants people that think the same based on your concerns about derailment that is the definition of an echo chamber if you dont want it to be an echo chamber you cant have it both ways i express similar sentiments about rblackfellas and rblackladies  gtand the creation of hbcus the naacp and any other black only spacesorganizations are reverse racism so whatnot the same hbcus are not exclusive to black people and they were created with the sole intent of giving black people an education where they couldnt get elsewhere that is not even close to reverse racism there are so many ethnic organizations at my school however they are still open to everyone regardless the majority of the people in those organizations 999 continue to be people in the target ethnic groups most people arent interested in the culture of other ethnic groups  naacp was created for the sole purpose of black advancement and civil rights unless theyre doing a paper bag or skin test like she is doing for membership in the club then no it is not even close to reverse racism gt im sorry but this doesnt bother mewell clearly youve clearly made up your mind about what you want to believe and think your way is the superior way if it doesnt bother you maybe think about whygtpeople said the same thing about mlk so again this doesnt bother me if anything it means that chrissies headed in the right directionno it doesnt radical does not always mean good that is like saying since hitler was a vegetarian that veganism is bad you dont always have to be divisive or be divisive like her to get change mlk is not a good example he did not exclude people from his movement and he did not berate the non blacks that joined the movement heck he literally said to not judge someone by the color of their skin but the content of their character if you want to selectively uphold attributes of mlk then hold up what he said too radicals end up giving people a bad name like the radicals that hate cis white men white people gays and americans if you want people who benefit from colorism to speak out more then educate them and be more articulate what did you go through 12 years of schooling and possibly college for gtare people who attend hbcus and join organizations for black professionals running and hidingnope not the same it is normal to want to be around people in your own culture however it wouldnt be good to run away from clubs youre interested in just because youre scared of nonblack people even the most fervent black civil rights activist will have other interests and duties that require them to be in non white spaces i doubt civil rights was all mlk cared about

3431	1	agreed  we all need to vent once in a while even if op came off as generalizing all black men she made it clear she didnt literally mean all men we all know not all bm are like that even if it was a joke  the overwhelming majority of black people date each other nobody has to date inside their race but its also annoying to see bw and bm put each other down in favor of other races that being said misogyny is a big issue in black spaces and in general before anyone points it out and it cant be glossed over that there are too many vocal black men who voice their sexist opinions towards black women and act horribly towards bw because they view them as lesser again this is based on my personal experiences and from listening to friends it does not apply to every single black manthis sub is one of the few places on reddit and probably the internet where black women can share their frustrations and be casual without having white people and men invalidate them or seek to center themselves even if the title was harsh i dont think its entirely fair to attack op i hope the folks getting mad over this have that same energy the next time someone slams black women on social media and it blows up or are we the only ones supposed to take it so we dont hurt anyones feelings

3468	1	these comedians make a living off of making fun of everyone they dont actually have those views youre conflating edgy offensive humor to actual worldviews these comedians do not actually believe in what their saying theyre only saying it because it is funny and will get laughs from people who share their sense of humor comedians are not the same as minstrel shows and racist caricatures theyre not going on stage in blackface and calling people niggers that would be ridiculous and a career killer again youre conflating simple jokes with actual worldviews a person who jokes about a certain race isnt automatically a racists a person who jokes about men or women isnt automatically a sexist a person who makes a joke about a sexual orientationgender identity is not automatically homophobictransphobicthose comedians stopped those jokes because of the rising hypersensitivity of our popular culture this is evidence that pc culture is killing comedyjoking about rape does not mean the comedian condones rape theyre not shitting on people when they make those edgier jokes all theyre doing is trying to make people laugh theyre not laughing at minorities theyre laughing at the joke nothing more and nothing lessyou saying that comedians shouldnt make jokes about rape women and minorities is proof of sensitivity killing comedy youre sensitive about those issues and dont want comedians joking about them now it is fine to hold those views what is not fine is when people like you try to ruin comedy for more thick skinned people by ostracizing their comedians and promoting this cancel culture we have now if a comedian is able to keep up with a joke for four decades that only means the joke works it doesnt mean anything else if a comedian makes a rape joke and there is a rape victim in the audience why should heshe care they dont know those people personally plus  if a rape victim who doesnt like rape jokes goes to the show of a comedian who makes rape jokes it is their fault for spending their money and attending the show without properly  looking that comedian up beforehand on the other hand if the rape victim doesnt mind  rape jokes then there isnt  even a problem either  way the comedian is not in the wrong if you like the joke simply dont seek out those types of comedians white people arent the only ones making the argument that pc culture and sensitivity is killing comedy hell im not white and im still a staunch believer of nothing being off the table when it comes to comedyi also believe that those hypersensitive people shouldnt be seeking out offensive comedians if they hate that style of comedy you wouldnt eat a ghost pepper if youre highly sensitive to spicy foods so why would you seek out an offensive comedian if youre hyper sensitive to offensive comedy
3469	1	exactly the exception clause here is what started up the convict leasing system and ultimately mass incarceration and the prison industrial complex check out the documentary 13th on netflix for a wonderful exploration of this and also read michelle alexander is the new jim crow for more info the structuring of this amendment in this way was very intentional they said if we cant keep them in slavery then we will just keep them in prisons

3484	1	gtnobody has a natural right to oppress anyone actually oppression is the act of taking away rightsim using natural in this context existing in or caused by nature not made or caused by humankind which is why i said it can negative or positive oppression can exist in nature but theres a different word for that in regards to the wild and i used right in this context the best or most suitable of a number of possible choices for a particular purpose or occasion  how would you classify these small groups of men are they even considered a class if one is rogueown his own gtmaybe look into the term social class and other sociological termsim sorta in it now i still have a some ways to go

3488	1	i agree with your general theory here that the larger a church gets the harder it is gonna be to stay accountable but what is your proposed solution for stopping large churches from becoming mega ones yes i like my church but as i said on a another reply if i ever think it is running afoul of the gospel ill leave it and no matter what the size churches in general have their fair share of issues the problems are just different at a small one versus a large one but issues exist nonetheless no church whether 10 members or 10000 is perfect

3496	1	it means a comfort zone for others
3497	1	noooooooooooo dayummmmmmm lmfaooooo this level of funny took me back to days on the playground with folks cracking jokes on each other
3498	1	being a pastor takes a lot more than having answers that among other things one being the fact that there are many ways to contribute to the church outside of leadership are why im not one honestly fewer people should be i hope you have a good day in the literal sense
3499	1	was he white
3500	1	this people who list sarcasm as an attribute are just saying theyre going to be really crassrude in interactions and claim theyre joking
3501	1	gt  it is black people that popularized the use of the n word in the 21st century if we didnt say it as often i doubt it would be as well known as it is now1httpswwwredditcomrblackladiescommentsa7fyp0aint_that_the_truthec31tyjthis is what spurred our thread it is the goto retort by white folks that is why i kept saying pull back from the word and look at the big pictureand yes there are tons of black people who are antislur hardliners but they come at the argument from a different angle
3502	1	it is not even just white guys honestly theyre all out here being wild and disrespectful
3503	1	you know who is killing black women the amount of deaths double over other racial groups this fact is always overshadowed by black mens issues that is what people discuss and rail against what happens to the women oh well next subject
3504	1	i agree wth them about the trailer showing more action i thought of this as i realized they were only going to do one job and not several but it didnt bother me really because the rest of the movie outside of the action scenes was still good i didnt think it was predictable i was just wondering whether one of the women was going to die in the end or get caught i also thought it had twists that i didnt see coming eh cant please em all
3505	1	the type of excellence im headed to is not paved with ignorance and trump mantras but continue your scam motivational speaker flex i guess
3506	1	thank you definitely will
3507	1	i just bought some color applicator bottles and jojoba oil pray for me
3508	1	in regards to this article do you think that this treatment or lack thereof is given the same way towards other woc
3509	1	yeah i know very few bm with bw 2 marrieds irl but to be fair most of the bw i am friends with date interracially non black poc myself included every time my so and i go out i feel like i see many more interracial couples in general but it is likely and la or bigger city thing i grew up in tn and its much more common to se bwbm together
3510	1	lmao i think youre the first person to say something positive about that film but even then better than bp naww
3511	1	yeah im really happy now lt3
3512	1	he gives off too much of an uncle vibe because he looks like the dudes in my family plus hes older im not into older guys just yet he aint ugly but i dont find him jaw dropping
3513	1	she wasnt angry though who wants to be called angry when they arent why is she assumed to be aggressive
3514	1	im gonna look for work opportunities on sites like workaway and on helpx so probably just teaching english to families or working in hostels and maybe do farming lol why would you like to move to italy
3515	1	gtmen of any race really respect women no men of any race treat black women like shit because of their skin theyre black and their women the fact that black woman can raise a child has an enchanting voice and the black womb can provide any baby without white interference disgusts a non poc the blackness has survived through many continents and islands so that is part of the reason why we are the most hated and disrespected white spaniard european dont suffer colorism in their communities so they have their own issues but when it comes to dating befriending or tolerating a black person their racism shows to people of color colorism doesnt exist in a dominate europeamwhite communities therefore their women dont suffer what black women suffer they just have their basic white privilege rights in a woman form whereas black women already suffering from colonialism add that whole chunk of western living with black men who are statistically shown as unstable our men are the last nation left to protect provide and encourage us to have men like this fail us in this way we have no protectors
3516	1	why are you trying to build boyfriends into husbands if theyre not already what you want in a husband you should move on
3517	1	the folks ive talked to get oddly specific it is hilarious but not really louisiana is a tale of two based on what i hear
3518	1	where did i say that i want white people to change for us please quote me exactly from my post where i said that  i actually did go to college and have multiple degrees and established work that extrapolates on black and white relations while also teaching and doing consultant work within education programs to help further black youth so you can miss me with that you dont do anything yes i can complain about the system while trying to fix it  what are you doing to help fix the problem other than acting coonish and trying to discredit my opinion with your false generalized analysis
3519	1	i guess but considering how fast exotic cars depreciate he is more likely wasting generation wealth than anything else
3520	1	exactly they worship money and wealth and many of them seem to think that the pastor is god this reminds me of this church that was in the city i grew up in when folks would go to the church regularly and become a member the pastor would have them bring in their paychecks and w2 and the pastor would decide how much the member would tithe to the church and how much the member could keep of their own check and this place was packed full of members who loved their pastor fucking insane the pastor and his family gave themselves high and mighty titles and they lived in a giant mansion with a giant wall built around it beyond corrupt but my thing is what were these people thinking to hand over their hard earned paychecks to the pastor and let him decide what he gets and what they keep
3521	1	yay thanks
3522	1	wtf how is saying i grew up in a black family  sound like what a troll would say are people this paranoid because of what raiders have done in the past i only stated my background so that i could give context for my question i felt that my experience as a black person in a black family was crucial to understanding the personal nature of my question
3523	1	her dad is a bit immature and is honestly a fuckboy doesnt want you to be happy but doesnt want to commit to you type shit so yes it was foul of him and she is soooo smart i know she could handle the talk and we really have a beautiful relationship we love her being a kid but i think my best friend and i are super excited to raise an adult differently from how we were raised we apologize to her when we were wrong and her right we teach her how to be kind to others and how to still stand ip for yourself shit shes about to join us in paris next yr cuz we already said shes going to experience the world from an early age i hate the narrative of shut your mouth and know your place because theres never any root cause to why a child is askingsaying something and its such a cancer in the black community
3524	1	i think its more of the optics that matter here no one really should be spending that much on a car whether youre a rapper or a pastor he seems greedy however it doesnt mean hes not helping other members of his church or the people in his community thats what the op was saying that he also could be committing stewardship they were also asking where do we draw the line because what would be considered bad spending for a pastor isnt always considered bad spending for a regular person he can do both its just doubtful because that kind of money is bound to get you into debt and trouble and as the leader of the church he needs to use his money to take care of the church which is his first priority but what theyre asking is whats the arbitrary amount before they look bad 1000 2000 theyre simply playing devils advocate jesus never said riches were bad or that pastora should never have valuable possessions as a christian you should keep that in mind
3525	1	basically the lesson to learn from this research is op is wrong about black women adapting like the sentiment you will hear on this subreddit there are increased barriers for black women who do want to date outside of their race because of the market value of black women compared to other races also he is right that the stereotype is a problem but it is not the only problem nor is it the root of the problem the root of the problem is the devaluation of black women in the dating stock market because of beauty standards which leads to what people perceive as the angry black women and this stereotype affects educated black women the most this misunderstanding leads to a stereotype that  make black women look even less appealing as a whole if op even admitted that black women are the least desirable partner he should at least admit that this stereotype regardless of beauty standards affects black women and the partners they are able to find the percieved lack of interracial marriage with black women is not because they are not willing to adapt  or because they have an unrealistic view of black men who can be fathers and it is been disproven that the myth of the black father is real
3526	1	fuoma is beautiful
3527	1	no denial there
3528	1	our country was built on warmongering slavery amp genocide and you think one black president was going to be able to put an end to it
3529	1	gt i guess im feeling a bit ranty today sorry lolit is ok to feel this is one place you dont have to apologize for such things
3530	1	how do yall know the black guy didnt benefit from legacy connections extracurricular sat scores etc or if race was even a major factor even if it was at all
3531	1	well i think what she did was brave as fuck and absolutely laudable shes a great friend and if there were more people in the world like her it would be a better place simple as that

3552	1	she is an absolute nutter who cant spell and thinks sleeping with white dudes cures everything from chronic dry eye to the check engine light in your car
3553	1	black ppl are really prone to ingrown hairs so if youre going to continue being hairless definitely exfoliate often if youre looking for an affordable option and youre located in the us i use stridex after i shave and a couple of times throughout the week  also the longer you go in between shaving the itchier youll get as the hair grows in i try to shave at least once a week  it takes less time too if you do it more often
3554	1	omg yes i completely forgot about homophobia and natural hair ill definitely add those to my agenda and same here there will be loads of snacks lol thank you so much for taking the time to give your suggestions its so helpful
3555	1	i concur they definitely werent that stupid

3558	1	i had hyperpigmentation as well and really struggled to get rid of it it is still there a little bit but it is faded and it did that on itself my routine used to have a lot of steps including the clarisonic brush which was a waste of money looking backat first i thought i had rosacea bc my cheeks always seemed the most sensitive and blemishedinflamed so i started following sensitive skinrosacea routines now i think i was just doing too much most skin care routines for blemished skin always include a brush and im very skeptic of them these dayshere is some of what i changed no more scrubs or brushes i know this might be difficult because freshly scrubbed skin feels so good but trust me for me scrubbing is what started it in the first place i had some blemishes bought a scrub and that just made it worse reduce routine to wash tone moisturize and optional serum i use a niacinamide  zinc or grape seed oil depending on my needs  use acids aha bha and co with caution i dont use them at all anymore use mildsensitive skin products avoid sls in your wash it is very drying and can make you skin sensitive  use lukewarm or cold water if you can so barefaced for some weeks a month or two or only apply make up when you absolutely have to that way i spare have to aggressively cleanse to get all the make up offwhen i applied makeup after going barefaced for some time i noticed how much my scars had faded i needed much lessi dont have many recipes to share myself unfortunately im looking myself but i hope this helps
3559	1	but what about stocks with dividends if youre just a long term investor should you not invest in some stocks if youre just leaving your money there youd make profit on the go right
3560	1	sis you would not be saying this about any white southerners because they use that same excuse some times our leaders need to be held accountable
3561	1	i never assumed we cant do anything my stance and solution is build your own nation i never seen a contract amongst black people please show me where they are discussing political issues contracts land investments and more with us
3562	1	right i cringed so hard at that comment
3563	1	oh yeah he was horrible to his wife tootchalla was awful to storm the marriage was a complete failure he kod her pretty bad in a fight too
3564	1	gtmaybe because im nice he likes methe joke is that if you talk to white men and women you find out that white women are mean manipulative abusive and even cruel to their partners all the time they just do it at a lower volume and in slick ways so black men who dont critique their behavior read that as nice
3565	1	idk personally none of that means much so yay we got one rich fancy royal black lady now and that made some angry racists internet trolls angry while africansblacksnatives still feel and lives with the effects of white imperialismcolonialismand yes mm has more power now but still is at the whim of the queen and look at what she sacrificed to be a baby making machine for the prince she cant wear what she wants cant go where she wants cant workact have instagramsocialize its all so bizarre and its probably because weve all been fed this white knight  princess narrative im just saying mm wont be a role model for my kids tired of glorifying white men saving us
3566	1	i feel like fish out of water black people are still black people 100 wouldnt even be a topic of they werent lol it is just an experience most black people cant really relate to but that doesnt mean the experience is less than or less valid honestly i think the criticizism that the experience isnt real comes from a place of deflection in the us living in suburban white areas is still the dream and a sign that one made it to most urban black families in order to keep that mindset they have to somehow delegitimize the experiences of black people who grew up there the same way many delegitimize the experiences of aa to hold onto white supremacists ideals of america being a land of opportunity
3567	1	resentment fees like a burden resentment feels heavy resentment feels like paranoia resentment is destroying mei have a korean therapist whom i adore but when i start to thinking about how koreans have mistreated black ppl it makes me trust her less and question our relationship resentment is getting to be really bothersome youre right that there is reason to feel it but its getting to be unproductive im not sure what to do about it and im not sure what to do about my therapist
3568	1	yes but not too in detail my next post would be about beyond the prison gates are we enslaved now outside the prison walls my answered would be yes 13th was an amazing film that highlighted us in the prisons  but when you look into these law dictionaries articles youd see our every day word of meaning is just another watered down word for slaverya person who is the legal property of another and is forced to obey themhow a person become legal property is through birth certificates bonds contracts taxes etcwe are forced to obey and pay in order to serve the us  from my findings and searchings tax is associated with serve and so forth
3569	1	maybe it was a culture shock my bf used to live in a commune with most of them and he said that he wouldnt live in a house with a bunch of white people again lol but nothing is wrong with the girl and youre right she is not my scene but gotdamn it she is a cutie i gotta admit that i am a bit attracted to her lol just being around a bunch of white folks isnt my cup of tea but maybe if i got all of the women of color together for a little hang out that would be cool and i can get to know them on deeper level im not im interested in what white men do and such lol
3570	1	yes thats what i told her because shes her own person and will live her life how she wants but i still gave my opinion since she was openly asking
3571	1	my goodness im speechless
3572	1	it came out around thanksgivinghere in the us at least i shouldnt assume everyone is from here
3573	1	thats what i thought especially with the hats in the beginning
3574	1	twitter lol
3575	1	thank you
3576	1	yo i had that roll sitting by the wall for the better part of last month
3577	1	yup it is pretty sad actually nowadays just a degree wont get you that far unless you have a higher degree like a master isphd just a bachelor is wont do much when you are competing with people who have a bunch of internships as well as a bachelor is
3578	1	im not sure why youre offended because you keep bringing them up and even say they got theyre stuff going on over there while asking what is good with us a few meetings with white people doesnt give you any real insight into what is going on with them you dont know what theyre doing or why theyre bringing men in white women are notorious for putting on a front and using any and everybody to boost their image im not really sure why you feel you need a white perspective on this issue especially since weve been doing this longer than they have in a much more difficult environment what is offensive is being compared to them at all when there is absolutely no reason to even mention them in a discussion of how black women and men interact
3579	1	sometimes they have it play for reference but its almost always added in post even when its diegetic main exception im aware of is perhaps the musicals where the singing audio is captured on set but even then i think music by instruments is added later
3580	1	thank you this is great ill look into all three
3581	1	good idea
3582	1	it was amazingwell i need more friends who i can talk shit with and vent tooutside of my girl my other friends are busy with life and work we are slowly growing apart
3583	1	gtif that is a problem idk how you expect others to learn about both sides i dont expect people to learn about both sides here i expect them to respect and center black women gt i want to learn about us but i damm sure need to know what they are doing because they are soliciting in my area on watered feminism power i have no choice but to ask to make sure we are not being overran than we already areit is entirely possible to learn and leave off comparing us gtim not focused on that right nowthen maybe youre not at a good point to be asking these questions in this way i mean that it is offensive to question black feminism on a black board without knowing what it is especially if you somehow find the time and energy to put in the effort to observe white feminist behavior gtit can be viewed as a comparison i cant help that intentionally wrote it as of what i seen with my eyes now i will say i apologize to you and any other who thought i just came here to compare but that wasnt my intention and i admit i should have wrote that a bit bettergtspeaking of comparison i would encourage anyone to compare and to conduct their own studies and opinions to help locate real information you have to start off somewhere that is the first thing you learn in school to compareunderstood but i wont be making blind comparisons to white people any time soon i dont hold them up as a standard or norm i learned in school that its important to decenter them even in comparisons and im sticking with that gtim pretty sure none of them felt inspired but the opposite i am aware of everything else you mentioned i felt inspired to question men being involved i didnt feel inspired to speak about question black feminismthat wasnt my comment but you asked and got your answer from multiple people
3584	1	cosign
3585	1	thank you
3586	1	gt unpaid internships pay to do this internshipftfy
3587	1	the part about winging it and being lucky to get to where you are that is e x a c t l y how i feel all the time worst part is our performance review is in 2 weeks and i thought i was doing great but now i made a mistake like this right before it
3588	1	this is a good one i too dislike beyonce i find her music catalog to be medicore compared to other stars of her caliber her voice is lacks any emotion so does she you can tell she is someone who is taught to sing but isnt naturally a singer from the soul
3589	1	i just sorted by controversial nothing there mods must have removed them
3590	1	yeah it is
3591	1	now that you mention it doctors offices do have a way of making you feel fragile it is a delicate balance of a clinical experience managed by another human being are they going to take care of you can you open up to them and be truthful giving near implicit trust is scarythat is good to hear  the holidays bring a mixed bag of things for many what is helping you this holiday season im doing okay working through a case of the blahs so im secretly thankful people are cancelling plans to get together and im dodging attempts to make any incognito mode seems like the safest option right now lol
3592	1	maybe stop being condescending telling someone youre tired of something is code for dont talk about it its basic social etiquette 101 you dont need to say it directly better watch it
3593	1	thisisnotaboutyou you have got to be one of the most unempathetic people on the entire internet holy hell
3594	1	girl relax goddamn you take the fun out of posts like this
3595	1	im kind of glad he did too many famous black women dont have their partners out here standing up for them
3596	1	look up social media influencers anyways you made a good call to delete this guy from your message you know the signs or may know majority im just saying others may not be as fortunate or some are ignoring it for different reasons if we teach one another be open minded to one another and learn how to attract well to do men itll reach to a load of audience whose willing to hear from their black sisters
3597	1	idk why im getting downvoted pure asians are typically poc actually theres asians with afros and african features smh do some of yall know black history and poc history not speaking to you of course brie but geesh
3598	1	yeah i kept thinking that was what happened it is good that it is gone it is an effort to report all these toxic subs that is on here but nice to see them to start fading away

3603	1	gtim saying theyre still allowed to exist me calling them a dumbass isnt stopping them from existing if they want to support dumbass politicians then im going to call them dumbasses i dont care abut how you feel as an individual
3604	1	do you solo travel
3605	1	lmao she said thats the tea she right tho
3606	1	youre right  i grew up with them organically any time i set foot outside or a friend came over as such i dont really notice  id rather be alert than obliviousi think it is compelling for us to each share how we deal with it there is a book i want to read called microagressions and modern racism here is a linkhttpswwwamazoncommicroaggressionsmodernracismenduranceevolutiondp3319703315refasc_df_3319703315taghyprod20amplinkcodedf0amphvadid312748656151amphvpos1o1amphvnetwgamphvrand10485752331538574686amphvponeamphvptwoamphvqmtamphvdevmamphvdvcmdlamphvlocintamphvlocphy9031905amphvtargidpla570578418683amppsc1   a major thing i want to avoid is allowing them to keep going because i dont notice  once i learn i can slow them down  at least for my immediate current and future work groupsgiven my situation it is easy for me to say and i saw a coworker do this effectively when someone is committing thisi know you didnt really mean anything by that comment but i want to save you some future embarrassment or worse did you know that type of comment or that phrase is generally considerred offensive by demographic  heres why brief summary  please reconsider before saying that to anyone againone person came back and thanked me later as she should have  she realized why certain people didnt seem fond of her and was able to prevent making that particular type of mistake againunless youre in hr or the offenders supervisor it isnt your job however it behooves us each to start reaching out to dampi at work and have conversations  quantify when you can  firm could be losing out on  of talented engineers  of revenue because we dont advertise inclusively to part of our market  look how kylie has to catch up with fenty  every year  of firms out type have to pay out  because of type of offense including micro aggression    this percentage of hostile workplace law suits start because of micro aggessions and unconcious biasi actually did that and dampi gave our team our own presentation it made my boss and his boss look good and i took credit and put it in my reviewn
3607	1	oh wow why come for me like that lol i dont think any of the active mods here fit this description although it is def true for a large sector of black redditors but i dont know the inactive ones to have an opinion step 1 is the only thing that rings true for me and that was certainly not my choice
3608	1	literally she couldve pressured you to put her stuff in your own purse and then you would take the fall
3609	1	lol probably a made up story is a good one with how many black men ive seen on reddit and irl including in blackfellas who openly admit to pursuing white women as a sexual conquest im having a hard time believing its a made up story
3610	1	yeah im starting to not want to be about that either i get you for me there is hugging and then there is all of those things and im just like wtf you know could seriously leave a young girl traumatized
3611	1	i agree what you said is definitely something that will help solve the problem as well there are so many aspects to this complex problem
3612	1	ive had the same experience as well they see an situation and bluntly offer a solution she is totally not wrong at all made great points and honestly i hadnt considered a matchmaker so that might be something to think about laterim not ready to date again and anything surrounding the breakup is still a really sore topic for me to talk about irl dating advice or being told that i should just get back out there make me feel irritated for the time being it all just hit me right in the feels when i got in my car
3613	1	i shouldve mentioned before but we have discussed marriage to where we figured out we shouldnt for the next few years due to his job and where we want to be next im totally fine with that i feel like getting engaged isnt as large of a commitment as getting married im not gunning for a big princess wedding or wanting to pop out kids im happy to go to a court house and surprise our parents with a granddog cat or bird they already have a grandfish lol im just tired of waiting ive had men dangle engagement when they knew i was done in a relationship and it kept me in it then those same dudes married the next girl in mere months i dont think this is one of those situations but its driving me nuts im tired of being good luck chuck
3614	1	100 the company you keep says a lot about you
3615	1	yeah this is probably true but i lived in spain for a bit right and i dated spaniards and italians and they think dark skin is beautiful  so the chances of them just going after what they are attracted to includes me you know versus in america having white dudes and even black dudes be like i just prefer whitelight girls but that is my experience and opinion
3616	1	this is exactly the kind of conversations we have she was present unfortunately when their parents had their final breakup and i happened to be in town and staying with them i was there an hour after the fight and the breakup and we sat her down and asked her how things made her feel she expressed herself well and a few months later she actually told her mom that she didnt want her dad in the house because it confused her she woke up one morning and my bestie was cooking him breakfast since she was eating too we were proud of her for letting us know how she felt my best friend is a saint she wants him to date never has a problem with them sharing custody and she is even welcoming 5050 custody if he wants it we all went to high school together so the history is so deep
3617	1	not to mention that theyre the ones who created that division in the first place
3618	1	my boyfriend did this except he actually called the waitress out  it was just the two of us and they added a gratuity to our bill on a sunday afternoon that they didnt add to the bill of the two white guys next to us my bf actually got up and looked at their receipt after they left because we were so confused by the gratuity he gave her the bare minimum tip and told her about herself  i was embarrassed af at the time but he was right
3619	1	isnt italy like the same though you know cynthia bailey from realhousewives of atlanta right i have a book from the 90s on how to get started in modeling from wilhelmina models and cynthia bailey was featured on it and they asked her how was her experience in working in milan and she went on saying that she was catcalled and street harassed a lot she also said that a man in the streets of milan kissed her hand and pulled his pants down exposing himself to her talking about gross but that kinda shit even exists in nyc so it wouldnt surprise me im down to hit up milan fashion week one of these days of my life already experienced new york and paris how about milan as well i feel more comfy with portugal because i speak the language i did changed location to lisbon my okcupid profile and so far i see so many whites lol but its europe what do you expect i did see only one black expat so far
3620	1	gtfirst child support is grown folks business kids do not need to be hearing the details about child support court finances etc let them be a child and be in a child is placeyeah im hit or miss on this one ive always been aware of finances etc with my birth mom because it directly impacted our lives it is hard to keep this information away from kids when youve got 4 people sharing a bedroom on the one hand it would have been nice to have that idyllic childhood experience but i think it would have been harder to have someone elselike the kids who teased me at schoolpoint it out to me knowing that money was nonexistent i didnt ask for things that we couldnt afford or get angry with my birth mom because we couldnt afford them another thing i learned was how hardexpensive it is to raise kids i also learned that if i wasnt emotionallyfinancially up to raising a kid on my own then it wasnt a good idea to have one because despite our best intentions sometimes shit just doesnt work out the way we plan them toampx200bgtsecond children love their parents so they always have a hard time understanding that their parent aint shit however as children get older they begin to see for themselves which parent takes care of them and which parent aint about nothing it is detrimental to tell kids that they have a shitty parent and they will resent you for it but trust in time they will see that the deadbeat parent aint about nuthinyeah i didnt meet my biological dad until i was 12 so i definitely didnt love him i was just angry that despite living around the corner from us and having never seen him that he had the nerve to feel proud of the way id turned out despite not having provided any support or input in the process nobody had to tell me he wasnt shit i was able to figure that out on my own to be fair though i didnt have any type of relationship with himmy mom was always open to our dads being in our lives despite the physicalemotional harm it caused herso i didnt have to struggle with any preconceived notions of who he was as a person i really feel for this kid in that regard because their relationship definitely complicates things
3621	1	i feel the same way im a straight woman but if i had a wife id save her rather than the baby i feel shitty saying this but to me my so is life would be the most important thing to me

3627	1	thank you and most definitely

3639	1	i dont know i think art degrees are for people with artistic talent and passion i agree that art degrees may not serve the same function for black women but to say that black women cannot afford to develop their craft is invalidating for black creatives and it is the type of thinking that keeps artistic industries white af i know my mom was not supportive of me going to college to pursue something i didnt love she said it would lead to nothing but unhappiness and would ultimately be a waste of money i believe she was correct

3646	1	my face is lighter than my body so i match my foundation to my body sounds like youll need to do something similar
3647	1	and that is not helping the black female bodywe live in a world where no one doesnt want to be told whether theyre right or wrong we just do and when one is concerned we say its hate or jealousy weaveslace fronts has been done for centuries you can use these methods to hide your hair without harming the body if you manage to harm yourself with this then obviously you need to put the weave down
3648	1	gteveryone hates black womensis there is over 700 million black women all over the globe if everyone hates us then why are their so damn many of us praying for your defeated spirit

3653	1	i think it is just a me thing i have little sense of decorum around food when left to my own devices
3654	1	1 black women saying theyre tired of black men is definitely not equivalent to black men saying black women are ugly  the former is a reaction to the latter more often than not2 racist white people are always going to find an excuse to shit on black people regardless of what we say and do were not adding fuel to the fire by utilizing the only space on reddit to say what we please  its not dumb for someone to get something off their chest 3 we cant have solidarity when black people are still discriminated against within the community sexism and homophobia exist its completely illogical and shows and extreme lack of empathy on your part to suggest that black women should basically just sweep their very real  and urgent concerns under the rug for the sake of some warped one way show of solidarity4 critiquing another black person or group of black people when its necessary and there is something theyre doing wrong is not anti black 5 by your own account your current girlfriend is latinx and thats fine but it seems strange that youre so overly concerned with black women and this sub despite not being involved with one at the moment why do you care so much whats said if its not relevant to your current life situation5 the fact that this is still bothering you 24 hours later is indicative of something greater6 youve already been on blackfellas saying you were banned yet youre still here
3655	1	this is a rare occurance if you dont let this happen i aint never met nor been in a situation like this before most of the time we are in the wrong areas to be searching just like black men fetish on white women or latina we get fetishes by foreign men as well especially whites theyre story just not as popular because of what the media and society want to promote but in reality i do not hang around men who has that type of mindset those are toxic black men and should not be procreating with
3656	1	gtim from zimbabwe and when i lived in england a white work colleague referred to me as coloured which surprised me because in zim a coloured person is a mixed race person and i definitely dont look mixed race in england i think coloured is not a word people use nowadays because it is seen as offensive someone can correct me on that  if i am wrong gtas i kept talking to her and she kept using other descriptors l actually had to say to her you do realise that its not racist to call me black right it was really odd this is pretty normal sadly i have no problem using black white etc as descriptors
3657	1	gti think coloured is not a word people use nowadays because it is seen as offensive someone can correct me on that  if i am wrong im in englandgt gtcoloured is not offensive in zim or south africa but its definitely offensive in other parts of the world its just a descriptor to say mixed race and coloured people in zimbabwe would not be offended by it i meant in england ill edit for clarification
3658	1	someone made a tldr
3659	1	she is a video girlmodel
3660	1	they can tell they understand all of that
3661	1	the jokes and im using that phrase loosely werent even funny they seemed like veiled poorly at that attempts to say some homophobic shit whilst i am of the opinion that digging up old tweets isnt always a great indicator of where someone is at right now the fact remains he put those things out there on a public platform when he blew up he shouldve erased the shit or got someone from his team to i dunno celebrity drama gets old  im surprised so many black people are taking the view that kevin shouldnt be banned from hosting though that was disappointing to see for me
3662	1	really that sucks dr pym from antman beat his wife and was a drunk but i think they changed that for the movies
3663	1	if only there could now be a rgonewildtubecolour
3664	1	smh
3665	1	speaking to rolling stone about his past comments hart apologized explaining how ignorant he was about his old jokes the funny thing within that joke is its me getting mad at my son because of my own insecurities  i panicked he said in 2015 it has nothing to do with him its about me thats the difference between bringing a joke across thats well thoughtout and saying something just to ruffle feathers i wouldnt tell that joke today because when i said it the times werent as sensitive as they are now  well he hasnot  grown cuz the man is still short  but i feel as though for the past five years kevin hart is known as the positive corny comedian i dont know the man personally but from the outside looking in it seems like he has grown maturity wise but im not kevin  that being said fellow white comedians amy schumer sarahs silverman and chelsea handler have past tweets saying very homophobic shit  will they be condemned or lose opportunities will we as group keep the same energy with them or will they get away with it because theyre white women even if all of these comedians apologize will we actually accept it or is it over for all of them
3666	1	why should he apologize give me a good reason i dont think he should have he should apologize because it offended alot of people  that is not a good enough reason because a lot of people also found those tweets funny back then if you find his material offensive than dont support him he has a right to make a living how he sees fit he stopped making gay jokes years ago and people are still trying to find a reason to drag him under the bus it is stupid i agree with him you should want honesty from your celebrities not some fake apology posted on twitterinstagramedit he basically said i shouldnt have to apologise for my early days im different now you can accept me as i am now or dont support me they want the man to get on hands and knees and cry to the public about how it was so wrong that he made those jokes on twitter  shits dumb
3667	1	yeah natural hair is such a trend i say this as someone who is natural lol this is my second time going natural as an adult and the same women who used to drag me the first time are proud naturals who never really wear their hair out this time i had a boss tell me i was being difficult in a performance evaluation for not allowing her hair dresser to give me a relaxer without my permission once so yeah i take all of it with a grain of salt op you wont be able to please everyone so just do you
3668	1	oh she wasnt jealous but she was delusional i was lowkey popping but i seriously hated myself back then
3669	1	gt build a modest building that doesnt rival convention centers and hotels there is middle ground here that people are completely ignoring i think partially in bad faithim not ignoring anything the church i go actually had 3 locations the original 150 year old building that holds 100 people another converted grocery store that holds 2000 and a larger one that holds 5000 that covers the gamut of building sizes and we still have 5 services every weekend to account for all the people who cant fit in each building at one time so again what would you do at this point its easy for us to say what we would do here on reddit when we arent the pastors who actually have theses issues of a massively and quickly growing church gt never at the level wher exoctic cars are on the tableno i dont think any pastor should be getting paid millions or even something like 200k  but its been stated several times on here that he didnt use church money to buy the car so im not sure why this specific point continues to be part of your argument the irony in all this is since he financed the car like and idiot he probably literally only put down a few thousand on the car
3670	1	im kinda bothered by your name but ill reply anywaywho has shown internalisted self hate im not going to a someone comment and randomly speaking about black men i made my own post to hear the voices of our women voice their views on black men i havent been trained since birth sweetie i raised to help both but im not a dummy when it comes to the struggle of what black women are particularly going through our men isnt highlighted enough i go to white feminist groups and seen something different so i brought that perspective here to get an opinion or fact of what the black feminist groups are tolerating with decent black men not men who abuse mistreat etc its wrong for me to be worried somewhat when my uncles dad brothers grandpas etc are put into that category im not watering down black feminism im asking does this group participate in anyway with black proactive men since you are coming to my comments do you believe black women shouldnt bring no topics or arguments about proactive men not saying to add them to the group but are you comfortable with some of them being your allies
3671	1	sickening
3672	1	you are actually damaging your own point beyonce is a pop star not a hiphop star if you dont understand the difference between the two i dont think you know what hiphop is and since you picked two ogs who are acclaimed for producing not rapping you definitely dont know your hiphop dre and diddy have always been dissed for rapping when their strength is in producingby the way did you realise before you posted that there are only two black female pop stars in the system now beyonce and rihanna are the last black crossover superstars and they were only allowed to rise because they were light skinned but in this market even they wouldnt be allowed through do you know why because everything a black girl brought to the table in pop can now be packaged in white skin from arianna to demi to miley to whoever they are currently manufacturing hiphop and rnb were the last holdovers from black female erasure and it looks like the labels are well on their way to rub us out of hiphop tooalso in beyonces defence there is no expectation for her to write because she a pop star but it is very clear that she is ensconced in the writing process even if she is isnt doing the actual writing album and song concepts originate from her seeing as they are often her life story there is nothing clever about desecrating an art form and cardis black fans need to stop endorsing this crap before the labels realise they can get away with in anything in female hiphop
3673	1	httpswwwaolcomvideoview_585a11dfc4d21f190406b8f5here it is lol it reminds me of my friend
3674	1	exactly
3675	1	ya people equate seeing black people in the news as us being treated better i feel like the more i speak out against racism the more im treated like shit by some people so it is baffling for people act is if i have it easy being black
3676	1	i am tearful and proud of your family  this is what im talking about  we cant let anything or anybody turn us around  thank you for sharing that
3677	1	just curious why do you think wash and gos arent for type 4 hair i have 4bc hair and its my go to style and the only one in which my hair thrives but so many naturals with our hair type wont even consider it
3678	1	since you askedgtteacher the man replied ive obeyed all these commandments since i was young  gt  gtlooking at the man jesus felt genuine love for him there is still one thing you havent done he told him go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me  gt  gtat this the mans face fell and he went away sad for he had many possessions  gt  gtjesus looked around and said to his disciples how hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of god 24 this amazed them but jesus said again dear children it is very hardb to enter the kingdom of god 25 in fact it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of godgti dont like because i think it is ridiculous that people expect pastors to live in poverty without valuable things you might not have said that but your replies are agreeing with what i said because you keep bringing up jesus teachings about riches when he never said you should reject all earthly possessions even pastorsplease stop with the false dichotomies they arent helping anyone especially not the church but again have a nice dayampx200b
3679	1	it really is its martina liana 870 if she ends up liking it also a tip if shes infested in a dramatic veil like i was but not a dramatic veil price tag like i was not tell her to check out blanca veils on etsy
3680	1	gtschadenfreude1 i had to google wtf schadenfreude was lol2  dont mind them good luck with your house purchase
3681	1	and its basically connected to clark atlanta and morehouse when you want to mingle with the others
3682	1	i wish your experience was universal but we arent there yet plus your list was very thorough thank you for that especially for women who are in the early stages of their careersbut the natural hair issue is extremely unfair and has been for centuries but life isnt fair but since we dont control the corporations we have to abide by the established dress code i think the attitudes are changing but the dreads and braids still carry a stigma i dont know if white people see it as somekind of political statement or what
3683	1	this reminds me to check on my mentee
3684	1	wait why are on this subreddit then no offense just curious
3685	1	yes ive learned the angry black woman is  nostalgia love for some taking them back to their 20 is when women were violent and angry in response to their irresponsible behavior then there is the classic some just cant  dont communicate then the reference above of im not karen or kim ming to stick around till silently while you do as you please sorry touched a nerve i may need a hug
3686	1	exactly a child is education and socialization doesnt end at home they learn from their peers and emulate each other while theyre still figuring out their identities being a good parent is essential but society has got to improve
3687	1	lmfao at this comment
3688	1	love her except for the blind side i just watched the proposal yesterday
3689	1	oh girl im watching black mirror right now eating some leftover christmas food
3690	1	im joking i dont think youre trying to oppress anyone but we all feel different ways and to say that because i feel differently than others will result in a non consequential ban seems like nonsense i understand where youre coming from
3691	1	beyoncé and dr dre both have teams around them that write lyrics for them so does p diddy artists dont create there own beats create the videos own their own make up clothing line yummy tea that they lend their name too i dont think its a big deal that they dont write their own songs
3692	1	its an unpopular opinion but as someone who has been actively calling out patriarchal bullshit for years and rejected by his family for it i agree with youjust like a single ladies cannot and should not change a man who has been institutionalized to hate her men cannot change and should change other men for the same reasons toofor every dent in that systematically backed toxicity the good men will bleed a thousand times over only for that dent to fixed right up by other drones of the patriarchy both male and femalethose will call you a bitch for being up in someone else is business cause as yall know it is okay to cheat drink rape people and just generally be an abusive mooch but not okay to bring it upit is okay to physically attack someone who brings up all the abusive toxic bullshit of their family but not okay for that person to defend themselvesin the end youll either wind up with a broken man or another toxic man
3693	1	i do believe the ending could have been better  the diner scene was not as good as i would have liked
3694	1	well as the other poster said only explanation is in donald glovers standup show weirdo where he was telling about how he was having sex with his armenian white girlfriend and she said fuck me harder with that nrdick and he came instantlybut like its a joke and probably a made up story i really dont get why people are so pressed about who he is datingmarried to because it doesnt erase who he is or his blackness
3695	1	a layout collection basically i do web dev but i tend to focus on the backend which is about the functionality of how the site works i can do frontend which focuses on the ui but i take longer to do it and i dont particularly care for it id rather just purchase a theme package and drop it in so i can focus on the parts i do like
3696	1	what is killing us are health issues violence is killing men diabetes cancer unwantedillegal hospital practices etc i can say black men is our 1 stress beside social issues im not overshadowing nothing in this post hon i can make 100 post about women i already done that this is my first post about men i dont know where who you been discussing these issues with but i dont just hop on one side and point a finger no i address both issues however the topic is focused on the support of black men that are doing right not the entire sexgender
3697	1	thanks
3698	1	yup and itd be even more awesome to have these shows be steeped in magic traditions from the diaspora i feel like i know so much about european magic traditions spell books their folklore and mythology and not enough about black american conjuring or voodoovoodou traditions from the carribean and folktales and magic traditions from africa any show that incorporates any of this and black witches will have my eyes and probably my dollars at some point lol
3699	1	now this i agree with he doesnt do it for me at all
3700	1	idk after she made such a big deal telling boldfaced lies about that blackswan mua girl i have my doubts i think she serves good personna but i think that is all it is
3701	1	yay
3702	1	yep theres nothing wrong with that but theres other types of us out there
3703	1	bot ignorant at all the way i interpreted it was that she was pretty because she was light skin and to be honest had she been dark skin i dont think he wouldve made it a point to mention her skin tone thats how i interpreted it being haitian myself i see colorism a lot in my community and my experience has been that some haitians are very infatuated with haitians who are lighter skinned the singing group carimi is a good example of the light skin that i am referring too i see it in how certain children are favored and treated compared to dark skin haitian children so i use these opportunities when presented to educate others and confront colorism but its very exhausting
3704	1	right just like barack himself asked rhetorically they won why are they so mad because theyre still fucking losers trump couldnt get them laid good jobs selfesteem or take away their impotent rage so theyre still going on shooting sprees and mailing bombs and destroying good things in the world and even the world itselfwhite supremacy is one big ass tantrum from some big ass babies
3705	1	its so corny because i feel like i learned it on reddit but the whole when someone shows who they are believe them adage also a firm believer in the initial stages of dating theoretically are when you put you best foot agame forward so if that is a mess dont expect any improvement over time
3706	1	im not worried because its owned by urban one which is the biggest black family owned media conglomerate in the country
3707	1	gtthey do it is just that the bad ones end up representing the entire group ie generalizingwell not enough do it also op was not generalizing like she told you there is just too many to ignore and it must be frustrating for a young black woman like her to find the ones that will treat her well not enough speak up and they just act as bystanders who are no better than the perpetrators because they enable this behavior black women shouldnt be left defenseless against thisgtthere are black men that act the way op described there are tons do not there are black women that act the way op described there are tons that do not people in general have a tendency of focusing on the negative and using that while all the positive interactions are less focused onthe problem is its not like you will find 2 good men for every bad one depending on the area in which you live youll be hard pressed to find men of your own race let alone men that are interested in you at all out of those men there may be few good ones and mainly bad ones some places may be better than others but for people that are not so lucky theyre not just going to spend the rest of their lives looking for a good man and not complain about it yes people have a tendency to focus on the negatives but there are valid situations in which a woman cant find a good man for whatever reasongtwhat is funny is this rarely happens with white men this op could have had tons of bad experiences with white men but i doubt she would generalize them since white men are afforded the luxury of being looked at as an individual and not representing their groupi think she focused on black men because theyre the closest to her own culture and they are part of her own race she is probably interested mainly in men of her own race maybe when she focused on black men she was just talking about her own particular experience with black men it doesnt mean she or other people dont focus on white men and if they rarely focus on white men it is because not only do they expect more from people of their own race and culture but while some may be attracted more to black men others dont have white men looking for them since theyre undesirable to men in every racial and ethnic group including black men so they dont know what to do and get upset because they cant even turn to men in their own proximity or cultureampx200bampx200b
3708	1	yikes i honestly find it a little worse in los angeles because i find there to be a lot of very insecure men and women that use relationships to advance their brand in one way or another hard to find a real one in the bay ive had sooo many men express the sentiment that they want a black woman eventually aka after theyre done being community dick for all the white girls and latinas
3709	1	i also find it involuntarily upsetting that people automatically assume shes his wife as far as the public knows thats simply his baby mamaand yet
3710	1	right he tried to get her to go earlier but she didnt want to listen
3711	1	pretty much all over im from png myself and so ive heard from friends and family about the chinese expansion in vanuatu the chinese are building a wharf and theres talk of a military base maybe being built there in the solomon islands its the same too lots of new businesses  hotels clubs stores etc all chinese owned i think for samoa it might be different though since the chinese have been there 100 years plus not sure about this though
3712	1	i see this argument often but i dont understand it tbh why would wanting a commitment mean you dont love the person you want to commit too i mean sure there are people who are in a relationship just for the sake of it married or not but honestly holding on to a relationship that isnt going anywhere looks more like being with anyone for the same of it compared to wanting marriage imo i guess it all comes down to what you want out of the relationship do you want stability commitment and legal protection for you and any kids then you want a marriage if youre ok without those things than marriage isnt for you i do think it should be more ok to not want marriage and that people should be able to have open conversations about intentions up front
3713	1	gt no i dont think it is weird for a woman is sub to complain about menagreed on that general level i expect that but intersectionally i think this comes off as really strange its one thing to say im tired of men its another thing to say im tired of black men like i said in another post your space no need to censure yourself but be careful of what you allow to grow bfellas would never allow racially charged statements like im tired of black women to propagate yall supposed to be our mothers sisters nieces ect why would i say that kind of stuff about my own kinfolk just look at my history and the response to something like thatdont get me wrong aint shit niggas need to be held responsible for their bullshit but the optics of this on a space like reddit is looking really sus
3714	1	we have differing opinions you see half empty i see half full  i view trash talk as an insult i see nowhere op was insulting black men sis clearly feels as a lot in this sub do that there is a disconnect somewhere and black women are feeling like a lot of black men arent boosting us up which is what leads to posts like this  it is really as simple as that no trash talk just her honest feelings sis has every right to express them as she did respectfully and honestly  but again this is the internet we have differing opinions on the way we absorbed her post synonyms to tired exhausted worn out weary fatigued dogtired dead beat bonetired ready to drop drained zonked  when i read the title i read it exhausts me when black men do this thing here and here is why  how is that trash talking seriously how what should op is title had been to appease you saying you are tired of something does not indicate trash talk in my world it was in no way derogatory or disrespectful it indicates a feeling brought on by an experiencefrustration sis explained what led her to feel tired maybe if more people listened instead of eyerolling because here comes another one of those threads with black women whining about how black men make them feel we could have productive discussions and learn from each other as op openly learned when someone mentioned the insta she was referencing was just jokes best
3715	1	lmao  true
3716	1	lol so true they seriously cant handle it im not sure why it even bothers me at this point when i should expect it
3717	1	unfortunately unless the mods make this private that wont change anytime soon even if it is true if they make it private they risk losing potential black subscribers that need a place to communicate with other black subscribers honestly it is a balance between hypovisibility and hypervisibility this sub hasnt made it on rall recently so its more towards the hypo side of the spectrum imo otherwise why arent the comments populated by white people trying to diminish black people is experiences why hasnt it become like rblackpeopletwitter  i saw a user who was probably a bot posting what people considered to be propaganda here and on rthe_donald and there is the occasional person that may post questionable things but i feel like it is pretty quiet this subreddit isnt even that easy to access imo i only found it because i wanted to see if there were other black subreddits and i literally typed in black people in the reddit search bar
3718	1	understood i dont care about what they are doing right so ill see my way out lol
3719	1	not only did he not put an end to it even though he promised to put an end to some of it he expanded it and made it even more lethal
3720	1	im totally serious lol maybe a discord dont know how they work but i know everyone is on it these days if i get enough interest id make us a server

3725	1	dampd as in dungeons and dragons
3726	1	i cant explain their rationale but i will say it is the sub on our automatic ban list most likely to catch actual black women a good number have decided to join this community instead of that one i think what originally draws people in is that on a topical level they focus on how white supremacy fucks am and bw dating prospects but it very quickly turns into an excuse for misogyny if i had to guess the black women who stay there like that non black women are taken down a peg as an outlet for their own dating woes

3730	1	black people are not to blame for the use of the word nigger if you really think that then you need to pick up a history book also while you may hear black folks saying nigga you rarely ever hear black folks saying nigger so we definitely cant be blamed for that and yes there is a difference of usage and meaning between the twopeople in many different marginalized groups have reclaimed words used against them see gay men using the word fag women saying bitch and countless other examples
3731	1	yes to both of your questions im not a techy so you may have more luck asking folks in rcanadapublicservants for advice a common theme for tech folks seems to be that you need to weigh job security and regular work hrs in the ps against higher wages in the private sector there is also a risk of not keeping your skills up to date because tech in some government departments is outdated and slow some people are trying to change that though check out the sub and look up groups like the talent cloud team
3732	1	i understand that but no her purpose to become like one of the vine popular people but yeah i dont have the best to tell her i dont like it and so i said keep doing her and id share with my other friends so yeah that is what ive done but i get what youre saying everyone needs their thing

3734	1	agreed connor is a looker his character is pissy attitude is a turn off for me though the keating five all came off as pissy and ungrateful but connor really rubbed me the wrong way for some reason
3735	1	thank you beautiful for your kind reassuring words lt3
3736	1	economic inequality and racial discrimination are inextricably linked white people love economic inequality because they use it as an excuse to ignore the racial aspect of inequalityfact of the matter is that even when you control for income to rule out the exact situation youre talking about poc are still held back more so it absolutely is a race thing source httpssocialequitydukeedusitessocialequitydukeedufilessiteimagesfinal20complete20report_pdf
3737	1	yeah people even i were told that extensions were made of horse hair and some actually are i looked it up and there is an entire market
3738	1	oof that is confusing ill have to read the article again i guess
3739	1	youre probably the only one who has posted an honest photo of yourself
3740	1	actually super cars especially rare models can be good investments
3741	1	they are figureheads  it is up to the brits to make that decision and they probably never will   there are royal families all around the world  im an africanamerican a product of kidnapping and slaveryand yet i still dont care what happens to any of those royals around the world  my husband and i work to make sure our family has a good life and can help others
3742	1	yes i try to tell this to my bf all the time even if we remove the racial bias crazy hypothetical lol and just go off selective memorypeople will remember catching the young black person not paying attentionusing their phonemissing a deadline more than they remember the cookie cutter old white man it is bullshit but it is the world we live in
3743	1	same i decided to be more honest about the fact that i am not fine and started saying im hangin in there instead of im doing well but then people start asking followup questions so i guess i need to start also saying i dont really feel like talking about it unless im with someone i trust
3744	1	what colorpattern is it
3745	1	oh no it is not all the comicbooks just marvel they suck at writing between the incest and random incohesive plots their comics tend to be all over the placeif i remember correctly marriage in general doesnt last however dc handles them better
3746	1	lol thanks
3747	1	using fake nails and wigs to temporarily change your style is fine but when black women do it we dont love ourselves got italso plenty of black women naturally have big butts and smaller waists
3748	1	it is interesting that you associate putting out a vibe with how women dress lol this is a creepy line of thinking that can lead to short skirt she was asking for it why not just talk to people and figure out the rest later
3749	1	the very question is itself disturbing evidence of internalised self hate some women are so indoctrinated they experience guilt  when women is issues are centered theyve been trained from birth to prioritise male struggle or pain the men is gotta be ok before we get to say errr could we talk about the harm you are doing menote that no other oppressed population does this self subordinating crap
3750	1	it is definitely getting easier to deal with as we go it is just still frustrating for both of us when he really wants to communicate something and i just cant understand him
3751	1	not everything that comes out of kevin is mouth is to be considered a joke just because he is professional comedian he wasnt joking when he tweeted  about smashing his oldest son over the head with a dollhouse if he ever caught him playing with one or that he would feel like he failed his son as a parent if he ever came out as gay there is absolutely nothing funny about normalizing the emotional and physical abuse of a child and how fucking dare he make his son is sexuality about him
3752	1	cool thanks cant wait to see what it is about these stills are great
3753	1	i mean some guys do look at me but i have this weird passive thing like when i like a guy and they show interest in me i start to push them away and look for insecurities in myself ive been told im pretty even by strangers do i dont think my looks are a big problem
3754	1	i believe as a black women we need to be educated about this issue this brother is opening up a door that has been locked for years due to our black men feeling ashamed and embarrassed i can appreciate a man who knows who he is and has built strength to help others pull through
3755	1	ive never had an issue with half asian people in the life lol but i dont have the same issues with other poc as everyone else seems too
3756	1	these are urhobo names
3757	1	i forgot how groovy that night court theme was i did a little shoulder dancing while listening to it
3758	1	gtwell good for you so have i i have 2 bachelors degrees and my masters along with published research after all that im still not valued as high as someone who is white with just a high school diploma youre missing the problemthank youampx200bgtit doesnt matter that black women hold more degrees we would still have to work an additional 8 months out of the year to make what one white woman makes per year httpschicagocrusadercomevenwithadvanceddegreesblackwomenearnless it doesnt matter that your educated and privileged it doesnt matter that you worked hard whether you want to believe it or not you still on average are making less that a white women whos less qualified and you can pretend not to come to terms with it or not but its a factampx200bexactly there are some people on here that sound brand new to racism or just like feeling special black but i think a lot are speaking from a place of fear too acknowledging the reality of racism is scary
3759	1	he had a knife are you kidding me
3760	1	amen op is too lazy to look these things up herself but wanna start something with those trying to break it down for her and educate her not to mention op seems to fundamentally not understand that black men benefit from sexism and male privilege even though they are disadvantaged by racism so sad how some black women eat up the misogynistic bullshit they are fed by black men without ever questioning it
3761	1	winston duke is definitely the best looking dude in that movie
3762	1	gt can you elaborate on the disrespecti appreciate you askinggt they favor the word being objectively offensivetrust me on this one it is not about the word every halloween the hypocrisy stares us right back in the face all these jack wagons want to do is make jokes at our expense without getting called out
3763	1	nothing but social convention and force stops people from saying whatever they wantfew people will call you homie off the rip just as few people will drop slurs in conversation or lyrics there has to be a level of comfort and if youre not comfortable and they dont respect that youre not comfortable then it says a lot about them
3764	1	i got tagged there once and i checked them out i honestly think they miss her
3765	1	i second this one theyve all worked out well for me and i like the fact that they give you skin type guidance
3766	1	an no one handed one over to black women gtbut that doesnt last long because we immediately got each other cant say the same for black menexactly they need to start with examining why they dont support each other even though they dont deal with the gender pay gap only racial deal with much less domestic violence and already have a head start in leadership positions in the community hypermasculinity is a big part of it they need spend to spend less time trying to distinguish themselves as one of the good ones and just do the work i completely changed my tone on this topic especially around online behavior after i saw how many black men jumped to defend bill cosby and how few stood up for terry crews and how few of the good ones even stood up to call that out they arent standing up for each other when it costs them nothing and anyone who expects us to act needs to sit down with that first we literally cant save them while theyre busy fighting to maintain patriarchy
3767	1	i am not
3768	1	yay blogging what are you going to write about
3769	1	his response to it all is yall won implying the public is what broke them up and not his behavior the usual fuckboy antics
3770	1	i love new orleans my grandpa is from there ampx200bi didnt notice it to be more diverse than san francisco la or san diego but it could have just been where i wound up as a tourist i also havent experienced overt antiblackness in san francisco however my threshold for antiblackness may be higher so i wouldnt know how to recognize it unless people are yelling the n word or specifically using other slurs and making threats in fact im sure i wouldnt notice  ive also had other black friends point out that i seem to feel very comfortable in other spaces especially if they intersect with wealth im not saying that you had to be in one of the super expensive boutiquest to be followed that can happen anywhere in fact once a friend of mine got followed and i didnt it was really weird ampx200bii wish you would have had a better experience here in case you return id love to recommend some places to hang out   are you planning to come clean to your boyfriend about your impression of her as another redditor asked
3771	1	im a native french speaker so let me know if i can help you practice your pronunciation
3772	1	im not saying dont discuss them sure discrimination makes things harder but lets stop acting like they make things impossible maybe im lucky because ive personally seen countless success stories ive watched people in my own family who came from absolutely nothing become successful they overcame so many obstacles but they still did it because they persevered and didnt let their race discourage them or tell them they cant do something to me my race is no excuse to let it hold me back how can i believe that when my grandmother went from a sharecropper to a woman with a masters degree when my own father went from poverty to a successful business manhonestly i really dont think its healthy to sit and wallow in self pity and that is what i keep seeing over and over again on the internet people acting like these obstacles make things impossible its okay to discuss the pain but at some point we have to get up and say okay this sucks but heres what im going to do about iti bring this up because im lucky to have been able to see success stories growing up because of that it had given me the confidence to pursue my dreams and let the obstacles be my motivation ive seen too many success stories to believe anything is impossible and i know that a lot of people havent been as fortunate as me that is why it is so important to have positivity especially for people in their 20s and younger if all you see is negativity and people telling you all the things you cant do how can you ever aspire to be something great how can you ever set a goal and actually take the steps to reach them it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy that is the problem im seeing here
3773	1	seconded
3774	1	yes financial blessings
3775	1	yea no problem ancestry is super interesting to medid the test say anything more specific than libyan i ask because modern libya has brownskinned amazighs berber is the eurocentric term for amazigh whiteskinned amazighs arabs europeans and subsaharan africans so your ancestors could be from any of those groups eurocentrics like to erase any black presence from north african history and afrocentrics like to erase nonblack presence from north african history but many different groups of people have lived in north africa for a long period of timeyou said that people say your relatives on that side of the family are asked if they are egyptian do they look like arab egyptianshttpswwwsahistoryorgzasitesdefaultfilesstylesarticle_imagepublicevent_picsgnasserjpgitokcwcd4cip native black egyptianshttpswwwhistorycomimaget_sharemtu3odc3nju4nji4ndawodyzegyptsanwarelsadatspeakstoisraeliparliamentjpg or mixedrace egyptianshttpscdn2imgsputniknewscomimages102804231028042343jpg answering that would help in trying to determine what north african group your family is from
3776	1	good he was trying to make it seem like youre the one who needed to pursue him but hes actually a jerk so obviously he couldnt pull it off
3777	1	that is what i thought there is so many variables to this that it can be difficult for studies to fully flesh out and include other races let alone include colorism and variants of it
3778	1	my gut feeling was to set the guy on fire but deep down it didnt come from an honest placehow dare he buy a lamborghini reflects more on me rather than his transgressions envy is a bad thing so i keep it in check as much as possibledude is trash i went through his greatest hits and they are really tonedeaf ha maybe he has done good but lord does this one make it easy to write him off

3782	1	it is just stupid and insulting at this point articles like thishttpswwwepiorgblogblackwomenhavetowork7monthsinto2017tobepaidthesameaswhitemenin2016 saying we have to work months into the next year to catch up with white men have been out but people are still acting like working hard is the solution or as if this garbage isnt just frustrating in generalliterally this is the first myth listedgtmyth 1 if black women worked harder theyd get the pay they deserve  gt  gtthe truth black women work more hours than white women they have increased work hours 184 percent since 1979 yet the wage gap relative to white men has grownampx200b

3785	1	i had a cousin go off on me one time because she for whatever reason texted me out of the blue about giving up on black men and their bullshit and wanting to date white and i was like uh youre just as likely to have those issues with white men and theyre on more bs on average if anything she was pissed at me for not egging her on and i didnt know how to respond to be honest

3788	1	sorry i dont watch tv  dont know who that person is my statement is based entirely on my trip to italy many years ago maybe things have changed since then it was 2000 i had an amazing time  italian men are definitely more forward than american men but it wasnt offputting actually i found it hilarious i may have a weird sense of humor
3789	1	no worries i appreciate you hearing me out httpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesi41h0xjkjxfl_sx425_jpg
3790	1	thanks ive actually already discussed it with one of my close friends who was involved in the situation she says she didnt hear it and wouldve spoken up if she had she is cool so i believe her im not sure how the other two girls will react  but i definitely plan on bringing it up to them as well when the time is right
3791	1	i mean she has a lot of young fans her defending rape as oh well he was only 16 or oh it was a long time ago is pretty dangerous imo edit i forgot he was in a relationship the boldest one as if you cant get raped while in a relationship
3792	1	i think it is b a lot of these responses sound like some of the older men in my family who dont know what to say when you let them know that the racism is worse after you do all the respectability dances youre supposed to
3793	1	he is basically my dream man

3797	1	ive seen 4 therapists since last year and shes been the one ive clicked with most shes extremely caring which makes me feel safeher stereotyping hurt and her not answering the question hurt more ive seen her 7 times and weve been making strides until the last session when she assumed i was from that city usually i love going to see her last session felt off in addition to the city thing she said a few hurtful things within the session with the intent of being playful i dont think she knew how much it bothered me it kind of made me spiral which is probably why ive been sent into this tailspin of paranoia your question helped me realize that so thank you and thank you for your supporti am supremely attached to her so it will hurt to have to find a new one and start over
3798	1	even if it is for vanity doesnt necessarily mean its body dysmorphia   ive been breastfeeding babies for the last four years   my breast are not what they used to be  so yeah once i lose this excess weight i have on me i want to get them lifted  i get what youre saying about people wanting a body type thats unattainable naturally though

3804	1	people want to be dickspeople also hate it when you call them out on being rude or an alcoholic or a rapist theyll defend their horrible actions to the death because accountability is beyond them

3806	1	i met him at a jazz bar in a neighboring city he sat next to me at the bar and talked to me for a bit and gave me his business card but he hasnt actually stated what he is offering but i told my friend from home about it and he told me theres a website his friend uses to connect with sugar daddies so i was looking at the website and strongly considering the lifestyle my cousin has one that just takes her and her friend out to nice restaurants and that is th extent of the relationship that is more of what im looking for not necessarily sex work
3807	1	thank you blessing to you too
3808	1	i agree although i think im getting spoiled on viola davis i was more impressed with all the other performances only because viola brings it every time so its kinda expected at this point

3816	1	i hear you i cant explain why mandatory participation feels like im crossing a dividing linegranted i dont fear being thrown in prison because i declined to vote for the next sheriff judge or city clerk it seems like one of those things that make you go hey pump the brakesthe first thing that comes to mind is which facts they choose to share or omit you know how people will skate around japanese internment privacy or civil rights i dont trust them to teach the whole story and the teacher has their own biases to account foragain i wholeheartedly support a curriculum where teenagers who want to learn about the legislative executice and judicial branches can link up with mentors in these fields this would do a lot to foster civic engagementlike all things money budget is the limiting resource
3817	1	yay someone else who sews
3818	1	omg im so sorry  i shouldve put spoiler
3819	1	i love this
3820	1	i like this kinda getting to know the actual people
3821	1	that was the explanation offered in both my gender studies and race studies classes black men feel the need to hyper masculinize because masculinity is to have power and as such a powerless people in society they have to acquire masculinity in other more artificial ways like being aggressive and super straight
3822	1	they might mean trevor noah and charlamane being chummy with her despite her being absolutely vile racist and an altright icon even wanting to have her on their respective shows was weird but i guess having a contrarian on every now and then might get views etc but it was reported that both of them hung out after their shows sent her little gifts etc and were both extra chummy which was bizarre to say the least
3823	1	youre confused about what i said being jamaican only by nationality doesnt mean they dont have roots there and i never said otherwise jamaican is a nationality so yeah i would consider african jamaicans jamaicans by nationality i think a more accurate description is original americans and original jamaicans
3824	1	it is and ive only picked up the term recently as i was told the x signifies non binary genders i still use both versions of the term
3825	1	i am a huge fan of natural products especially for my hair not so much my face because girl i need all the chemicals to keep it clear lololol i tried to use 100 natural products on my face but it just does not work for my acne whatsoever i own my own hair care line that is all plant derived so thats what works for methat article you read is 100 correct companies market irrelevant ingredients to consumers just to get money which people fall for this because they see their favorite celeb or youtube rave about this particular ingredient ie rose water i have seen hair products made with the most random ingredients i once met another hair care owner of natural products and was sooooo excited to talk to her because shes very established she told me she puts a drop of a popular ingredient in her product just so she can market that its in there i was never so disappointed and this pushed me to really care about my products even more because people are really playing black women for fools now i shop with that in mind and dont fall for these trendy productsingredients i know most of this was about hair but trust me cosmetic companies of all kinds use that tactic with trendy ingredients
3826	1	and we have a holiday for that murderous fuck christopher columbus and we have thanksgiving so we can give thanks for what happened to the natives and we have football teams with names mocking the natives and we etc etc etc sigh
3827	1	that is the point assuming im understanding the post correctly theyre saying women is word is not taken seriously theyre saying nobody question is a cop is narrative when they say that some person of color was threatening them when we know it is bullshit the law and order thing isnt saying that everyone goes out of their way to prove her rapist is guilt it is saying when she comes forward everyone demands extensive and conclusive proof of her claim despite so easily accepting the cop is word and that were willing to believe abusers and killers over the actual victims
3828	1	they dont really have any power in the government
3829	1	fell off as compared to what i thought they were already over all in the dumps
3830	1	denzel sterling k brown jayz and a bunch of otherd rappers will smith watch black love and youll see more

3835	1	95w10regular
3836	1	ill agree that youre laughably ignorant at best and disgustingly complacent at worst
3837	1	time to pull a neo and dodge those bullets ole ex is shooting at you if he this childish then put him in a childs placecongratulations on your singleness sis
3838	1	i think it is silly to me and i just dont get any excitement out of it i also hate christmas music
3839	1	black isnt a culture its a race if youre racially black i dont understand not identifying as black
3840	1	she did those other girls sooooo wrong
3841	1	its not about him saying nothing bad but that he doubled down when confronted and only could give a bad apology after facing consequences for it also pointing fingers at other people being problematic doesnt absolve you hes not above it im not above it and we can only improve if we dont hide behind excuses ive said plenty of dumb shit and own it and take responsibility for it and part of that is to try to stop doing it in the futurealso hes a middle aged wealthy man not getting one job hell live
3842	1	want a source it is not much but all dna isnt the same
3843	1	i think it is mainly because of her facial expressions when she is acting it sometimes comes off as unnatural and just a tinge of awkwardness i love her though
3844	1	this is true people sometimes lose hair who arent black trying these styles
3845	1	that is what i was thinking but i was hoping there was some spots with some blackness sprinkled in im looking for mainly good food and some live music i couldnt find any concertsmusic festivals happening in august not picky just want to have some funim from philly
3846	1	she could but people who learn that crappy people are normal tend to continue to pick crappy people youre right she does i wouldnt be surprised to find out she had one hell of a childhood that explains all of this
3847	1	can we please stop feeding into the stereotype of bitter angry black woman for no reason black women are always targeted by whites and black men black men throw black women under the bus all the time for white women please stop policing black women attitudes toward misogynist from black men its not black womans job to educate or set any type of examples for anybody if a black woman points out misogynist and other subreddit mock it then they are the problem not black women
3848	1	gt no matter what you do itll be seen as disrespectful to some black people and asking whether or not your actions are respectful as if the small subset of black people on that subreddit are representative of all black people is actually disrespectful as fuck to me nonblacks love to ask one or two black people permission for things and then do it as if that one person that said yes somehow is representative of all black people just so they can ease their guilty consciencesi assumed she asked because she wanted to grasp the issue bettershe lives in australia where the black community is relatively small so the easiest way to get the most diverse answers could very well be on subreddits like rblackhairi couldnt disagree more about the questions we complain when they encroach on our space without permission then we complain when they ask to come in doesnt seem reasonable to me
3849	1	gt chrissie already does all of the things youre talking about she created a platform called divine dark skin where she talks about fashion beauty dating tips etc for dark skinned women she promotes dds heavily on her youtube channel shes had her youtube channel for a while now and knows that just creating a space like that isnt enough to keep the trolls outwhat trolls though and why are people always trying to hide from trouble that is not the solution i was just saying suggestions if she already does that then fine plus this thing she is doing isnt going to keep trolls out dark skinned women all dont think the same way i hope you dont think that as people have said before skin folk are not kin folk that applies to dark skinned women she doesnt even have to do this if she wants to make sure everyone is on the same page she should just hire some moderators for the forum which any forum administrator should do anyway and she should make every new member including the moderators sign some kind of application including who they are their name nice facts like their birthday location etc on the application they should say what they think the purpose of the forum is why they want to join the forum what they can contribute to the forum and how they can actually contribute to the stigmatization of colorism in their own communities for the moderators an extra step could be why they want to moderate a forum such as this and what they will do to combat inappropriate content trolling and derailment they could also include their experience moderating as well a troll whether theyre dark skinned or not isnt going to go through all that effort and different people will use a different kind of language she shouldnt try to use pictures as a substitute for what she should be doing anyway ive seen one person on here say one thing and then do a complete 180 and act like a different person on other subreddits the same can and will happen with women she deems dark enough since theyre not a monolith gtthere are a lot of people who think that catering to dark skinned women is divisive and counterproductive chrissie knows that its divisive and she doesnt care her first priority is creating a space where dark skinned black women are valued and appreciated and if she has to be divisive to do it then so be it she is doing more than just catering to dark skinned women you didnt get my point at all what she is doing is basically a form of reverse colorism basically her rule is you have to be dark enough it wouldnt go over well if someone made a forum for light skinned women you can talk about privilege all you want but light skinned women have different makeup and beauty needs too she is being way too radical no one said creating a forum exclusively for black women was a bad idea no one is complaining about that the problem is she is only giving people access based on the color of your skin and whether she deems you dark enough it is ridiculous you dont run and hide in real life why is a forum any different i feel like people here and on that forum if she institutes such a policy need to focus more on coping methods and defense mechanisms rather than trying to be in unrealistic hypercontrolled environments dark skinned people are not bubble boys hyperinsulation from the outside world can harm them not benefit them catering to dark skinned women will always be divisive to an extent there are better ways to bring more people to your side than this kind of behavior

3875	1	isnt sprite also soda
3876	1	nobodys saying they arent black they saying they aint shit theres a difference
3877	1	i just find it disturbing how we as black people can often forget our own individuality ranting is appropriate at times but i dont think pointing out the individuality of black men and trying to preserve that is bad i just hate seeing us falling into the racist thought trap that one or even several black people behaving in a certain way indicates a widespread problem that is what racists think about all of us and sometimes i think we talk about eachother that way too not just black women about black men but vice versa too
3878	1	gtyou absolutely are comparing outcomes for black men and black womeni admitted earlier i was comparing and apologized for that gt you also dont seem to see that placing responsibility for black men on black womens backs is not novel i didnt say anything similar to women should be responsible for men you took it out of context yourself gtyou want to know how to deal with the men in your life teach them about intersectionality teach them about male entitlement teach them to empathy for women remind them the world will grind on with or without them and most importantly teach them its not the black woman is job to nurse the world like some 1950s marmiefunny the men i know understand 98 of that and are still told to shut up read some comments when you see subjects like thisgt3 black women are far more likely to experience gender based violence than any other race or sex the vast majority of their attackers are their intimate partners who happen to be almost exclusively black men this has to be said because conversations like this can guilt black women for sending their attackers where they belong not every black guy in prison is just a poor victim of the system we need to be careful not to coddle men who exhibit toxic masculinity do you expect me to disagree agree with you compare that statistic to black men orits said often believe it or not trust me my feed is filled with all types of crazy experiences i hate this needs to be heard towards the white and black community as a whole because i can tell you now black women dont even know these facts and other facts we all been presenting to one another this all needs to be said every day we are raped more than a man being wrongfully convicted im not going to dispute that that is all i have to say on that one
3879	1	they were so picky but working at the local walgreens im done
3880	1	black women too tbh
3881	1	i am not saying let is change how we act so white people respect us i do not believe in respectability politics at all period not what im saying im saying let is keep our business within our community for example within the confines of our home my family parents sister auntsuncles etc often openly discuss the issues we notice within the black community but let a white person walk in the room and we stop it right there we are not going to badmouth our own in front of white people because while this discussion is coming from a place of love a white person will twist those words and use them as a weapon and pull the even black people say it like those dumb ass videos of black people online talking bad about black fathers what the fuck are you doing man and then this shit gets reposted by racist white people with see black fathers are shit even this black guy here is saying itthat is not right imo let is keep these discussions in spaces where theyre coming from a place of love within our community let is not publicly talk shit about our own people it is an ugly look and im not for it as for the slurs that is directed at this blanket response of i dont care what nonblack people think as i said right you do that we can care about prejudice and discrimination and slurs all which fall under the umbrella of what nonblack people think without changing our behavior to appeal to those people those two ideas are mutually exclusive caring about racism against blacks is by definition caring about what nonblack people think
3882	1	right people are commenting like im making up the facts of reality all you have to do is throw in google black women paid less and youll have endless articles studies and statistics that prove it as fact they can be in denial about their skin color if they want the rest of society sure isnt
3883	1	yeah that doesnt sound like a lower middle class upbringing at all to me
3884	1	while some aspects of bwe are great some are very damaging and draining for some ladies the hatred of black men are real as is the teasing of fat women to a lesser extent but for me the positives outweigh the negatives and im all for the positive
3885	1	yes i think that is what it is like i dont why i have to go the extra mile just to not be angry or aggressive
3886	1	off topic but yugioh has literally the best black woman duel in all of anime with ishizu vs kaiba its a must see because while the show doesnt dive into race they accidentally wrote a really good black woman character for those two episodes and one of the best matches in the seriesshe just puts up with kaibas insults so quietly and calmly and lets him destroy her deck only to flip the whole thing on him and leave him nervous and cornered she still loses but even then shes still in the right and has a good moment herself
3887	1	sits by yall
3888	1	definitely hard each month when you get your period i spoke to my mom about it and it turns out it took her 2 years to get pregnant each time as well never thought about the toll it takes on you when trying to conceive until i went through it im thankful we live in a time where there are so many avenues and it seems like theres always another route to take
3889	1	i think perspective is necessary here so many wealthy or well off people i know have very little of it because they grew up in wealthy enclaves andor surrounded by people like them
3890	1	im honestly saying he is doing more than making a bad decision that might be buying his wife a high end benz and posting it on instagram  im saying his decision is an indication he is likely undeserving of his title and the chance to realize what he is doing while holding it
3891	1	if that is all you got from what i said then i dont know what else to say plus i never said stuff like that doesnt bother me as if youre some bold warrior obviously i know that doesnt  bother you in the first place

3895	1	gtpeople hear not all all the time from every corner i completely believe changing this stepping away from defensiveness and doing the hard painful work is a chance for christians to stand out from the rest of the world but i also understand why someone wouldnt agree with that approachampx200bactually in my experience people hear that christians are bad from every corner just like marginalized groups worked to change misconceptions about them christians too can work to change misconceptions about them while changing the church theyre not inherently autonomous things it is only defensiveness if you cry about it while doing nothing to change the church but there are plenty of people like i showed you that are the church is full of many christians so there is bound to be plenty of bad ones and it is a hard issue to overcome it is an internal issue but there are people working to overcome the issues in their own lives and not sitting complacently because they think theyre not doing anything wrongampx200bgtpersonally i think the problem is bigger than how people view church it is how they view christians i think mostly because of conversations ive had the vast majority of people know that not every church is full of corruption i dont even necessarily believe john gray is is to be honest just like i think they know that all white people arent evil and that every single cop isnt a murdererampx200bi dont think you should compare people fighting against systematic oppression for 400 years against authorities to christians in the church though yes most black people know not every cop out there is a murderer or that not every white person is racist but not every person knows that not all churches are the same at least from my experience or else you wouldnt have people bashing all churches which is commonplace online i agree that this issue is bigger than how people view church based on what you said it sounds like people think christianity and a physical church building with people in it are one and the same so they end up viewing christians in a negative light too if they knew that not every church is full of corruption or not every christian is problematic then they wouldnt only highlight the bad ones while completely ignoring the good ones  for example you can tell from this articlehttpswwwnytimescom20180615ussessionsbibleverseromanshtml that the media and the public will only focus on what this politician said as if his version of christianity is the most accepted form but they wont notice his opposition or pay much attention to it even when you have prominent church leaders opposing him why arent they getting their own news articles i understand that it is a natural human reaction to mainly see the bad in everything and i am even guilty of having this mindset but i dont think this kind of narrowmindedness is something we should encourage  regarding your comparison you even have people playing the not all white peoplecopscis men card when theyre clearly not even being generalized they dont want to be confronted about the issues they have they dont understand the difference between holding someone accountable for the sins of their ancestors or people in their group versus saying that they benefit from said actions of the personpeople that sinned or they dont even care and say  not my problem there are even some that dont believe there are problems with whitescis malescops because they dont see any evidence  however that is a different issue from saying not all churches   the difference is that a church especially an individual one is an accountable body white peoplecops arent necessarily accountable bodies especially because of systemic factors lack of connection to their culture and legal loopholes yes just like whites can be blind to white privilege christians too can be blind to sin but depending on where you live you can find the ones that arent for example there is a christian association at my university that talks about god all the time and even welcomes nonchristians nonbelievers have even admitted that they felt welcome even though they werent christian are white peoplecopscis men doing that are they forming groups of people that hold themselves accountable as individual churches do are they doing things such as personally rallying with people in their own groups for marginalized groups on their own volition please read part 3 herehttpswwwredditcomrblackladiescommentsa71ct2megachurch_pastor_john_gray_defends_200kec57vr8ampx200bampx200b
3896	1	i tried listening to him years ago and it was bad then i cant imagine what theyre doing now
3897	1	gt and it then gets 1 painted a blanket problem and 2 something that is somehow the root cause of the majority of our problemsyoure right  those are two examples of distortions in the post 1 is overgeneralization and 2blaming youre right that we shouldnt do that has anyone actually gone and charted the number of positive vs negative post on here i think it would be some interesting data to look at
3898	1	you might need to talk to more nonblack women they have stories for days of their men and their games
3899	1	that sounds wonderful
3900	1	lol seriously what new insight has been gleaned from someone banging their chest and bellowing about political correctnesswhat is jordan peterson telling people that richard spencer somehow hasnt been able to get his hands on
3901	1	the average man orgasms the majority of times he has sex the average woman does not hell most dudes dont even understand that vaginal orgasms are rare theyre constantly talking about their penises as if women are getting pleasure just because they are im not complaining about anything that happens to me personally im speaking up on behalf of women who arent as dominant as i am there is a larger societal issue with treating male orgasm as mandatory and female orgasm as optional
3902	1	lol dont be i cant control peoples mouths and thoughts that shit doesnt phase me at all
3903	1	ive been lazy with keeping a routine but as it is growing i will have to in order to avoid damaging my ends i dont know i really like the short hair look

3906	1	we agree but with very different emphasis and concern and that difference changes the way we approach situations like this and probably a lot of others
3907	1	1 adjust how you perceive the situation  if these arent guys you are into ignore the situation2 learn how to draw attention to yourself in the most comfortable way for you
3908	1	when i read the changes last night i had to go to bed nothing else could be done

3910	1	damn how are you doing in all this are there plans to talk when he gets better or is it done done
3911	1	i completely agree with you the best thing i learned in life is that some people just arent going to like you you can stew on that thought or you can move the hell on if i got my blood pressure up everything some nobody said something stupid ida die of stroke by now we need to focus on whats within our power to control and learn how to better cope with disappointment ampx200b
3912	1	i know how that must feel as ive heard people thought i was weird is that just what you think or did they tell you they think your weird  sex or romantic relationships should not determine someone is worth but i understand how that feels and it is something that many women struggle with in current days do you have any friends that know how you feel
3913	1	ikr  i mean we are women and have to deal with sexism but why do black people have to be dragged into every analogy  leave us alone
3914	1	gtbut how do you know there are tons of black men who do not act in the way op described op has probably dated tons of black men as have many of black women on this sub and their mothers aunt is grandmothers great aunt is etcyou are also assuming alot about op you dont know if she is dated tons of black men also it was a general statement if you think the majority of black men act the way she describes then there is no convincing you gtso how can the generalization be invalidanecdotal experience is not enough to generalize an entire group of peoplegtif you read the comments on this thread and the many just like it you will see similar posts just like ops so clearlythere arent a ton of black men who dont act the way op describedi dont follow tbh you realize black men acting normal isnt really a rare occurrence where a thread would be dedicated to it it is the negative things like this where people want to vent that have threads dedicated to em
3915	1	the audiobook that daniel is character was always listening to was everything and yes that scene in the car with colin and his assistant is cinematography gold the camera angle  the conversation is why steve mcqueen is so good i know it is been out a few weeks but i was literally the only person in the theater today seeing it it definitely needs more recognition
3916	1	thank you
3917	1	it doesnt fix it youre def right about that im not necessary trying to solve the problem as much as distract myself im not rich by any means but im fiscally responsible and work hard and budget hard to make sure i can enjoy myself every guy my age that ive tried to go out with is struggling with money worse than i am and theyre all so far behind in their emotional intelligence so i guess i just want some healthy distractions that are older well established and can afford to go out and have fun with me as opposed to guys my age that just want a low maintenance relationship where we just stay home and watch netflix every weekend or if we do go out theyre worried about money and dont think the experience with me is worth spending their money on i also want to add i do not expect men to pay for me i always try to pay for myself so im referring to guys who havent been able to pay for themselves or just flat out dont want to spend the money to do something with me whether it is a concert amusement park escape room etcyes grad school is tough and i have been exploring hobbies and meeting people but those people i meet typically are only reliable when im doing that specific hobby does that make sense my friend that likes to salsa will only sometimes show out for salsa and so on so im looking for a consistent distraction not a man to come fix my problems i enjoy my own company but what i can do is limited and some activities i would like to do arent all that safe for me to do alone like going out alone at night in the city or doing a difficult hike
3918	1	gtthats fine but as other commenters have said when black culture is taken away its makes it seem like black people have no culture at all i just had a thought what if white people have no culture because they were the dominant culture for so long
3919	1	someone said he probably not even blackidk but he directed it towards this sub sound like a black depressed male gtwhy are black people so obsessed with and always pushing for ir couples i think the ones who wasrejected by those around themgrew up around white peoplehurt abused unhappy with black peopleor self hatred these people typically push for ir couples you only have a few who are in ir relationships just for love and theres nothing wrong with that i believe i feel some type of way when a person gives up on a race besides abuse which is something i can understand theres no reason to just ignore your own maybe im too problack but then again i dont care for ir couples
3920	1	i have two kids in college pursuing art degrees i wouldnt dream of pointing them in any other direction but we have encouraged them to have a plan b within their field so that they can be gainfully employeed in their interests while also pursuing their art that said my husband is an artist who is working in a very lucrative adjacent career and his parents are artists doing the same im not an artist whatsoever and i would not have known how to guide artistic children if they didnt come from two generations of artists we have no connections in my childrens chosen fields the author seems as if she got the memo to go to college but didnt have much guidance to maximize her degree a few posters have mentioned how crucial internships and coops are especially in the arts and someone also mentioned alternative jobs and travel as options i wholeheartedly agree on all of this this is why it is so important that black artists become mentors to younger artists who may not have the guidance to strategically pursue their careers regardless it was so hard to read her experience
3921	1	i mean reddit is a forum
3922	1	gt i dont think it makes sense to prefer one over the other when youre talking about race people are people and if you say youre mostly attracted to black people for example that is a fetish and not a preferencei second this statement like first youve gotta see people as people second imo people of different ethnicities and backgrounds all have things that make them attractive beauty isnt beholden to any race or color or anything like that
3923	1	you got a right to not like saying the n word but my nigga you tripping when you start blaming black people for other people saying nigga

3926	1	he helped so many black people not just me that is what i want to do for others i have already tried to help some black people but i dont know what it is some people just dont want to take my advice and im not in a position to hand out jobs yet a black woman and i were at the same level last year and when i got this promotion i told her straight up that i could help her get hers and i think she saw it as a slight when someone offers me career advice i take it right away and then figure out what is applicable to me or not i can silence my ego if it helps me get a promotion
3927	1	period the amount of times ive been rejected or dismissed or ignored not bigots because of my ethnicity karmas a bitch

3929	1	wow this is really great and incredibly helpful thank you so much for taking the time to write this all out you definitely made me excited about all these restaurants it is sound like a good place for a weekend trip if country music isnt your favorite but you want to experience that type of atmosphere just once

3931	1	yup they stated something like i think you are projecting your insecurities on this man you already have your boyfriend do you want the friend too i dont even like removing posts but come on now
3932	1	its so sad others dont recognize it like were all supposed to be jokes for you to laugh at its so insulting and demeaning
3933	1	the boondocks had a problem with this too and i also want to point out that i myself am a guy so i have to say this with my limited privileged perspectivebut yeah the shoutout has to go to luna in season 2 where shes talking about her history of being abused and its played as a big joke complete with a cheesy violin to further trivialize it robert never leaves his lesson of dating women for just their bodies which is whats hot him in trouble in the first place and luna kills herself over her abuse what the fuck
3934	1	i have a hard time even feeling slight sympathy for comedians in that area you make your living just like any other artist meaning your income probably lives and dies by popularity why are they the main ones who cant deal with that fact gtas for regular joes i havent heard much more than grumbling about sensitivity and we cant do such and such anymoreim guessing they just mean they get challenged now
3935	1	i honestly think black people use the school system as an excuse for not examining why they want to move into overwhelmingly white areas private and parochial schools exists can be affordable and there are plenty with students of color in our cities but for some reason people act like moving to an upper middle class area and sending their kids to lily white public schools is keeping it more real than catholic schools in the inner city
3936	1	choosing a white woman over a black woman just because she is white is white supremacy it upholds the idea that white women are better by default
3937	1	because when confronted about it he could easily say that was me in the past and i apologized for what i was he didnthe made a post just complaining about how people are looking for something to get mad at and is still a slap in the face to black lgbtq folk when we have comedians make sketches about how hard racism is to endure only for them to shit in women or lgbtq folk insteadhes not being tortured hes just not getting one gig hell livethe idea that people are just faking outrage is just dismissive and insultingalso the lgbtq community isnt  a monolithic entity so please dont talk about it like its one
3938	1	yeah ill probably write a letter to complain but i really hate doing even that
3939	1	damn  he was oozing white boy vibes then goes to my original plan 0 patience for all these ultra trifling ass men  i swear im end up single forever smh
3940	1	gtthere are white feminist who takes in men and it just builds their group strongeri dont believe in looking to white women for guidance or standards in anything but we support black men in many more ways than they do so a few who happen to take in men to feminist groups dont mean much to megtas far as the negative objectives you stated abuse violence etc do you see yourself supporting black men who never done any of those thingsim like almost every black woman out here who is supporting black men in her daily life even some who have done and are doing those things gtfrom what i gather in a male group on facebook men dont want to support the group addressing hypermasculinity because they feel like they shouldnt be grouped with the restthat is their problem and they probably need to do some self reflection before deciding they dont have issues with hypermasculinity im sure they dont give white people that pass when it comes to racism gtbut isnt a trend as feminism of all sortsfeminism isnt a trend with black women it never has been anyone who says or thinks it is needs to read up on our history more outside of the  perspective of white people gttheres men that are creating webinars books groups the whole 9 but it just isnt enough of them mostly because a lot arent aware again this is their choice they can and should work on that gtfrom my understanding these small groups want to be helped or help black men but strongly suggest having a woman to support them as they grow through certain obstacles not saying to take away feminism but to add or coparent especially with the good groupsare these adult men theyre able to run businesses start and run churches put together sports teams and parties they can do this on their own if theyre interested just like weve started our own groups and worked through our own issues if they cant there wasnt any hope in the first place
3941	1	i dont know if this is really disagreeing since at least the way i see it intentionality is a part of knowing what want out of life if theyre intentional in their own lives and treating women poorly that is a choice since theyve demonstrated capability maybe going to do is a better way to say it than capable of but i also think it is difficult if not impossible for any human adult or not women included to be intentional with other people if they arent intentional with themselveseither way though men being raised the way they are and the way theyre taught to see women in their lives i dont think most are going to treat women well while not being intentional in other areas i think it is something women should keep an eye out for and adjust their expectations around
3942	1	you should look at exile i also have a crush on this idol called tomohisa yamashita
3943	1	gt i saw something yesterday on here about a certain sub and it is similar in vein to what they enduredpeople having fun at your expenseyes having to live that every day is just too much and i imagine it is worse now with white children who have come up with social media memes and access to black comedians and personalities while still being raised in homes that dont try to minimize racism
3944	1	wtf are you talking bout afrobeats is the culture of west africans in france and socazoukkompa is the culture of the french west indians that live thereget the fuck out my thread with this bullshit

3946	1	im 110 for more positivity i just think it is important to not frame it in an if youre not positive youre part of the problem kind of way not saying that is the way op was meant but that was the way it sounded to me
3947	1	i know right im at work now with my outdated mini twists lol i have an attitude all over again
3948	1	true i should start challenging it more because the example is always something that has happened and no one cared then
3949	1	gt my opinion is that serena williams comes off really fake to me and im not really a fan i still cheer for her whenever she is playing sharapova thoughwat
3950	1	youre in the blackladies subreddit most people dont feel the need to preface their questions with confirmation of their blackness here it is kind of assumed
3951	1	true he couldnt have easily googled that  i know he was a well educated man he started a school once he settled
3952	1	funny how he became an a list celebrity without accepting criticism he must have been around people that didnt care about his attitude because he was funny
3953	1	have you ever watched nyma tangs makeup tutorials she usually matches her foundation to her neck and body because of the tone differences thats a solution some women use
3954	1	as soon as i stopped relying on conventional wisdom  keep in mind i did that for years a lot of sites that were recommended to me by my peers were not good for me the ones they discouraged were better for me most of my peers are not of african descent as such fettish guys were over abundant on okc and matchcom in my area1 use your unique strengths2 be open but if someone creeps you out at all block them immediately dont even respond3 get a burner number but dont share social media bc that is providing tmi for fraud or someone clingy4 it is fine to look them up for high level background checks  i eliminated some people based on that   guys seemed willing to give me info unsolicited and i could filter out fettish and general folks looking for something different than me
3955	1	it is troubling to say the least but that is exactly how it plays outnonblack folk use the word amongst themselves or they have the one black friend who for whatever reason plays along in their little gamei was at one time the uncomfortable party but there were other warning signs i ignored along the way long before somebody asked me permission to say niggaand once we reached that junction they werent my friends anymore i felt like i got conned but what the hey i was in high school
3956	1	youre not being dismissive i totally agree i moved to college in a place further up north i shouldve moved to somewhere like dc
3957	1	the city has to be put on blast to get anything done to serve the community there is a lot to be put on blast for like our lack luster response to the affordable housing crisis
3958	1	ok cool just throwing it out there in case you werent i definitely listen to my favorite murder in the mornings true crime podcasts creep me out at night lol
3959	1	women and men worked together i cant romanticize any of that even in the 1800s through 1900s many marriages or what not went from better to worst especially men that was raped beaten and women who went through the same those people who were emotionally unstable had children who were forced to watch the occursa lot of relationships back then strived to make it better so men thought it was safe place for a woman and children to stay home it wasnt intended to control besides the abusive males theres many more stories im gotten from old natives and black natives from the south some were sad some suffered from generational abuse and so fourth but the end of the conversation typically end with we had each other a lot of that is destroyed now obviously and im eager to improve the generation further what i can say is from then to now we are valuable in their eyes we produce the future in their sick way every nation they took they always took women and children but this time when they decided to free us physically we become enslaved again mentally that mental enslavement can cause some serious illnesses and destructive concepts unknowingly they let us go but focused more on men the media the songs the society etc black men is the 1 for entertainment the producers threw that in along with rape songs money women and that influenced not only them to become sick but us as well so what im saying out of all of this is we had each other in the beginning when we were sick now we dont have each other and still sick our ancestors tried to reunite in the 1900s but was killed for that that wasnt romanticizing but was a blessing to actually had heard living witnesses explaining their love for each other what i just mentioned is only a small section as to why this world so corrupted  to know that they knew their lifestyle wasnt healthy but did whatever means to survive they thrived as a family for some years until the next generation came and the government started programming the young to feel normal in a white society
3960	1	thank you so much
3961	1	i have to contact the financial aid offices after the winter break is over to confirm things about my fafsa so im not entirely sure yet i do think howard would give me more though
3962	1	what year kelis
3963	1	this is kinda sweet are you a guy
3964	1	gtlearn to depend on yourself because that emotional support will not consistently come from your family plan to go to therapy at some point to help yourself grow and heal from your child do not i repeat do not depend on a man to get you to your goals or escape your situation if you are sexually active wear a condom at all times no matter what he tells you do not get pregnant right now research colleges or tradeslearn the details and in and outs of the journey to your goals so you are educated and not caught off guard as much as you are ableampx200bthere is nothing i can add that hasnt already been said but i want to emphasize the do not get pregnant part i saw a lot of my friends who were your age become stuck in their situations because of a baby ampx200balso try and find someone at your school who you trusta counselor teacher advisor etcwho can help you with future planning for college if your parents didnt go to college or theyre not encouraging you to go since youre providing free labor and childcare they most likely arent talking to you about what you need to do now to prepare for college you do need to start preparing now in order to apply for scholarships grants etci would also work to set it up in a way that allows you to not receive support from your parents it might be more expensive to take out loans to live on campus and be on your own  but it will be worth it in the long run for your mental health
3965	1	nice
3966	1	i completely agree if someone says something problematic now correct or cancel them if a swift apology isnt made totally fair is there a time limit in correcting someones comments can we go back five years ten years when we were teens it was the early 2000s lord knows what people said on their myspace or early twitter accounts it will be interesting to see if people start using this method to expose everyday people for their sexist homophobic or racist comments they made in the past
3967	1	you were talking about respectability politics and what non black people say about us not slurs non black people will call us the n word whether we fighting on the street or were the president you might as well do what you want and not police other black people for doing what they want just so others wont talk about you
3968	1	it was a joke
3969	1	both my parents are brown skinned i came out very brown with a head full of curly hair my sister came out three years later light skinned and bald it was a running joke for years that my mom had stepped out  with my dads white best friend do people not make jokes like this or is my family just weird
3970	1	no need to assure me of your allyship im was just offering some words i didnt think you came off as judgmental or anything but perhaps i could have worded my post better to reflect that you come as off as aware and genuinely interested in learning more to understand thanks for the reply and thank you for your candor
3971	1	ugh im spending my second winter in central florida after living up north for my whole life im having such a hard time getting in the christmas spirit listening to my favorite christmas songs is literally the only thing that helps
3972	1	im running a campaign based off of pre christian ethiopian mythology and ethiopian folklore its super fun
3973	1	who even says phat anymore is this 1997
3974	1	ahh they are notoriously colorist
3975	1	i can respect that fellow non party person but what type of shoes did you get
3976	1	born and raised in northern cali and i moved for that very reason
3977	1	i always have to get a summer foundation and then another for winter because my skin color changes drastically
3978	1	i dont want that kind of life but i am going to defend john he had a book plus a tv show on own typically once pastors have other streams of revenue like this they no longer take a salary from the church i dont believe he used church money to pay for the car i read a different article saying he used money from his book and show to pay for the cari believe him because ive heard him preach several times at lakewood and at my church in nyc we arent anyway near being bffs but i perceive him as a servant of god and as a genuine person his messages have blessed me so much and have been the catalyst for me changing things in my lifetrust me i get that this was a beyond extravagant gift for his wife but if he wants to spend his money on that car then he has that right i truly believe he didnt take money from the church to make it happen
3979	1	uhh we dont have that type of relationship its an emotionally abusive household and speaking up is just going to go badly for me so id rather not
3980	1	racism is not in people is head because it is empirically true but that is not what the op is talking about it is about how do you process these facts and opinions are you committing any cognitive distortions while you are going this even if some told you racism is all you head why do you believe them if you know its empirically real or let it impact your behavior this is what cbt makes people explore
3981	1	moms called northerners yankeesi cant lie tho i absolutely can only drink a coke on a full stomach you aint never lied its poison a delicious poison
3982	1	hmmm yeah i see what you mean thats a tough one for me just because i know how much he has positively impacted the lives of many but now maybe that has all vanished in a single purchase
3983	1	that is encouraging to hear i love hearing success stories like that because theyre so rarely talked about in schools in the media etc i really do hope this channel can be something that represents the best of black culture and can stay away from using the neverending stereotypes of us we all had to watch growing up but sadly i doubt it its like people want to see that bullshit still otherwise why would it still be there but i must admit there is hope there is definitely been some progress recently in media still i dont want to get my hopes up and be disappointed for real im so sick of white people glorifying the very worst aspects of black culture in movies and music on repeat even the good movies they make are always portraying gang violence and ghettos and yes there are a lot of very tragic and fucked up realities too many of us have to live through but all the more reason young black people need to see more programming that reflects them positively and im pretty sure the majority of us dint live our lives that way and most of us peovqbly dont even sell crack or shoot neighbors from the windows of our cars the truth is black people in america and all over the world are doing amazing things and have been doing great things for millenia that is what i want to see i dont need to see any more tyler perry sitcoms or booty shaking ya knowso please ms cathy hughes do us right right on this one
3984	1	i love how the hug and rock is still quite a thing those are always the best hugs
3985	1	oooh tattoo
3986	1	pacific islands like samoa and new guinea
3987	1	i grew up in a two parent household and my father was pretty homophobic  my mom not so much and my mom is older brother is gay and she always tell stories about how her uncles would try to take him to the park to basically beat him up and toughen him up   this is of course the 1950 is so it sounds horrible  i dont think that is quite it
3988	1	do you follow anyone in particular like on youtube
3989	1	ok you really need to start identifying yourself as male it changes the context of your posts greatly please add flair
3990	1	much appreciated
3991	1	the shortest ive left them in is 3 weeks the longest is 8 weeks on average i keep them in 45 weeks because thats about how long the curly hair i wear looks good
3992	1	no for sure there is a chance he could have had a fetish his whole life and never acted on the urge imo were older both been in long term relationships n stuff he could have explored his fetish by now realistically speaking
3993	1	ah well as far as work and school go im disabled so all i have to look forward to is traditional stuff getting anything done with the va is a nightmare that i cant control ive tried a number of times and oof i am bummed about that but it is what it is i see your point but if youre not ready yet why even mention it i didnt think about it until he said something but now im consumed with thoughts constantly
3994	1	a legal commitment a long term relationship is not a legal commitment which creates issues with inheritance finances childcare etc
3995	1	sometimes timing is an issue  usually men are more likely it seems if they are done with school and have a promising career if he wants to accomplish one more thing then there are a few kpre years before he is ready  timing is just a big thingi can relate to the whole late to the party thing it is really rough
3996	1	this
3997	1	the weather would definitely agree
3998	1	gtor do mathlies lol
3999	1	well my parents were kind of overbearing as in they picked out my classes in high school but my physics teacher help me with moving on to univeristy my high school was weird most of the teachers were hippies not even trying to hide it but science and math teachers were from other countries like serbiaindiauk
4000	1	the ones that arent exploited or never heard on the mediabelize and other south america island countriesthese people are heavily populated with rich native and african mix culture and it is so divine over there more blacks than anything
4001	1	the misconception is that by calling him the abuser its makes it seem like he is the pimp when he was actually a client how can is a client not an abuser this boils down how you view sex work some people think sex work can be job if the sex worker is fully autonomous and consents to the job that is to say there is the scenario for prostitution that is not abusive which would lend to the term client over abuser brown was a minor so this would be technically a case of abuse since a minor cannot give consent and also be she was not autonomous because she had a pimpsome people will say he is not a child abuser because he did not know and was a child and that may have changed his actions others will say abuser is not appropriate because according to browns account he did not abuse her
4002	1	you know that makes sense because i just read an article on online dating and it says that for women dont just have a bunch of selfies have you doing a hobby or something you like to do or a place youre happy at so this makes sensethanks
4003	1	i decided to spray it with water re twist and pray lmao
4004	1	it is definitely one of those things that is really hard to understand and sympathize with until you experience it the idea that it is easy to get pregnant is so pervasive and it is such an unpredictable thing that you can only control a little bit makes for a very stressful combination im very thankful for medicine today in the past i either could have died from my miscarriage my body wasnt taking care of it on its own and then even when they did the procedure there was still some leftover to remove couldve gotten infected or id actually just be completely barren and thered be no way for me to have a genetic child of my own by bypassing using my uterus
4005	1	gt im more into cyberpunk and urban fantasyjust in case you dont know shadowrun is cyberpunk and urban fantasy it is also got a convoluted and clunky rule system that usually the gm has to override just for the sake of keeping the game going
4006	1	httpsimgurcomas82lufa
4007	1	vcu was my second choice school im a little sorry i didnt go

4010	1	that would just give lurkers more of a voice
4011	1	im 22 years old graduated in may i didnt apply right during senior year because i needed more research hours shadowing and gaining more hours that being said i would like to apply in the 2019 cycle my grades are fine its just the mcat im retaking it this spring medical school application is a beast in itself im pretty sure im going to keep applying even if i rejected 2x medicine is my dreamone of the physicians i worked with really inspires me she said she was in medical school with two 40 year olds age is just a number she was the youngest one most people go to medical school nowadays at 2526 if you want my advice i think you should definitely apply again if this is something youre curious about for closure do it apply do routes too retaking the mcat and maybe getting some type of research oriented job will help too its never too late to try
4012	1	youre welcome
4013	1	i just got home and my friend sent me a pikachu scarfi hit level 40 on tuesday and apparently told the raiders coaching staff all about it  they are very nice men i was stone sober  my friends told me who they were afterward they laughed really hard and were a nice enough to take photos with all of them i was slightly embarrassed at that point
4014	1	society dont want to feel responsible
4015	1	as do i i end up in philly a lot every year when im visiting my so is family in jersey and im not the biggest fan of the area i met lovely people of other ethnic groups but so many of the white people were inyourface racist as fuck even just over the ben franklin it is bad i keep meeting people that claim to not be racist vote liberal and say all the woke keywords and then dont have a damn friend that isnt white
4016	1	the whole point of going private is to stop certain people from lurking but theyd be no way from stoping those same people from voting if we took a poll
4017	1	gtyou are also assuming alot about opno im not im reading all the commentsgtit is the negative things like this where people want to vent that have threads dedicated to emthere are just as many threads on this sub with black women uplifting standing up and fighting for black men as there are threads about them venting their frustrations with black men
4018	1	yep they brake it down from like 45mph to fucking 20mph just to look at my black ass chillin in the yard and our house is set back from the road so they be lookin harrrrrd i always wonder is it so absurd that a nigga might live in a big nice house that white eyes literally cannot comprehend what they are seeing i guess so
4019	1	clicking the link at the top of your browser and typing move after the re in reddit will have the same results
4020	1	this sounds amazing i would do it
4021	1	thanks for the well wishes tbh i dont need him to appreciate me i jusg want senior management to see that he is useless wishful thinking
4022	1	i think people focus on the white culture vultures but not enough on the black people that facilitated the absorption and commercialization of black culture part of me wonders if we should look at them in an even worse light because without them black culture would not be nearly as accessible as it is now and people would be more likely to learn about black culture from its original source with all its history and nuances i think the black people in these positions have succumbed to the negative and even positive stereotypes about themselves so they think doing so is the only way to gain social approval or make a living even if they know it is wrong those black people may not even care about the implications of their actions for other black people because they are too obsessed with money
4023	1	theyre not simply saying the nword theyre going on whole rants about how black people are inferior i am half asian i know that they completely mean ityoure not fooling anybody it comes deep from the heart
4024	1	no one is putting down black men anywhere not everything is an attack on you or black men when a woman shares her experiences
4025	1	amazing thank you
4026	1	i dont see any issue at all with having height preferences as a very tall lady myself thats not a fetish
4027	1	the only comments i saw were many saying bria myles is hot none saying she isnt so im not exactly sure what is going on here
4028	1	it can definitely be applied to others because that original poster most likely had a white dude in mind since ya just unsentletters
4029	1	fuck it where them locs and dont apologize for it
4030	1	maybe well meet at the club and fall so deeply in love
4031	1	gtyet these are the same people who want to have a luxury vacation and dont want to stay in an airbnb or hostelcouchsurfingat least back in the day now it is hit or missused to be such a great resource because basically you were staying with a local who could tell you all the good places to go free museum days best local market etc and more often than not theyll go out with you to dinnerwe liked to either treat our hosts to a meal at a place of their choosing or a homecooked meal but my friendsand as i type this im realizing that im not friends wany of them anymorewere always grossed out at the idea and couldnt get past the  istaying in a strangers house part
4032	1	this is a huge honour tbh
4033	1	or being told i dont see color when they see you at thanksgiving like ok guess im just casper out here right the problem isnt seeing color its seeing color and assuming things because of that color
4034	1	im so sorry i hope youre healing after that sounds like a total mindfuck
4035	1	gtfeminism does not support black menboys beginning with the title of this threadi had simply asked a question in regards to their rights being acknowledged by feminists i also stated that through statistics theyre voices are not heard due to a low count of them lack of laws to protect them and are not trending to even let us know theres good men out there the point of this post was to ask not to impose a specific group of intellectual black women being that it is through the phone with so many disturbances i wasnt able to convey or type my message as accurately as i needed gtim saying that feminism isnt somehow blocking black men amp black boys empowermentum yes it is it is called a trend when you type in empowerment groups you see black and white feminism everywhere with the allies of the lgbtq community and other minority groups but yet the general public seems to be ignorant of the intelligence and acceptance black men indeed possess i had to make a post about it their numbers are low their iq and everything having to deal with them is low besides crime and drop outs women are expecting all men to be responsible when such a small number shouldnt hold any type of accountability to other men negligence the message question and conversation starter was to address the concerns it is not our fault really it is not its society and the media that push it out have we not been raising them for nearly 4 generations a woman said yes well if we raised them already how the hell were living amongst several generations of hypermasculinity fragile abusive men and the question isnt meant to blame shame or any other adjectives to offend one another but if it is indeed true of the high rate of single motherhood and disgraceful behavior of black men what can we do to help change and not point fingers im not asking for a remedy to directly help them but to indirectly help them with having a mind of peace instead of a piece of mind because at the end of the day we need men i feel like this is an important subject because feminists are raising little boys all of us needs to come to an understanding for the sake of our living and protecting children is innocence
4036	1	i have noticed and it furthers my idea that white supremacy is a disease because like any disease it can infect anyoneit is the same patterns
4037	1	wwhat but the only value women have is men wanting to fuck them tho s
4038	1	my comments are being downvoted as well
4039	1	oh ok so it is the response he gave not the black men dont cheat part
4040	1	this we probably cant even be friends there is just too much to work through
4041	1	theyre not conservative talking points lol this is not political at all this is about a comedian who should not apologize for what he said in the past leave the dude be he was trying to be funny go somewhere else with the fake outrage enegry
4042	1	but that is not somebody else help him please
4043	1	well then we could cross that bridge when we get to it  but as of now we have someone who never actually made a true apology for their wordsand i dont think thats true when dave chappelle made some offcolor jokes about lgbt people he made an apology within his comedy and people accepted itfurther i dont know why people are even trying to rally around hart 1 hes not funny
4044	1	she is never asked me these questions directly and has asked him instead once again because you clearly are running your own narrative with what i wrote i simply do not have to provide an explanation for why i wear my hair a certain way to anybody if she were to ask me directly sure ill give her an explanation similar to what other posters have said its none of her damn business either way and whether i way my hair natural or relaxed is a losing battle for many people and if someone dislikes me for relaxing my hair maybe the issue is with them and not me relaxing my hair is my choice i am not my hair
4045	1	hmm that makes me wonder at least in elementary school what are the benefits of the private school vs the gifted program in public schoolgt always consider nearby schools if your home has to be at at all marketable to parentsthis is key
4046	1	i have to find the darn link im kinda iffy on the court system because regardless she shouldnt be tried as an adult but someone on reddit claims they knew that person she killed my feelings too conflicted right now and of course the white folks are putting their say in it
4047	1	wooooah yeah white womins get away with so much like smh my ass forever gets followed whenever i shop somewhere or whatever whatever to you and that girl is friendship btw did it just faded away or you cut her off
4048	1	your last point is so true if anything you should use your friend as an out instead of bringing them on the date
4049	1	yep when i was working retail i was told to watch a black person who had a bag  this happened often a white guy comes in with a bag no issue the joke was on them though because the only people caught stealing were white folks
4050	1	wow wow and wow  black moms being black moms   growing up i never stole from the store because my mom would always be on my ass about it stealing and giving me life lessons about it and i could imagine the punishments i wouldve gotten if i ever did it ampx200balso fuck all the coon ass black security guards and the white ones too a similar experienced happened to me recently as well when i was at the beverly center mall in the los angeles areaampx200bwhen i was visiting la last month the guy who i was staying with dropped me off at the beverly center mall because he had to go tutor his cousin or whatever i was wearing jean shorts and a velvet crop top as i was walking around the mall trying to find a food court btw that mall doesnt really have a food court i believe it was going through renovations and all they had in there were expensive restaurants and little mini cafes for places to eat a black lady who was working as mall security mall approached me she wasnt rude or whatever but i still felt like her approaching me was internalized anti blacknessracially profiling she was asking me if i needed any help and i asked her where was the food court she politely responded to me that the place was going under renovations and that they were few restaurants and cafes to eat at at the time i only had 10 or less to my name and the only thing i could afford at the mall was the cheap skincare products and 5 clearance rack at the forever 21 store lol although the black lady security guard who approached me was polite and somewhat helpful i still feel til this day  she only approached me because she had this notion in her head thinking  this girl looks suspicious and probably cannot afford anything at this mall what is she doing here it be our own people sometimes bruh smh i know people got jobs to do and gotta survive and they are under pressure by their white bosses but black security guards should chill tf out yo i have countless experiences for days lol but this is my recent experience harsh reality of being a black person yo yet white folks be the one stealing lmao ampx200bampx200b
4051	1	that is it exactly theyre hurt that they cant go everywhere anymore also are they asking to be taboo but to be treated like their views are mainstream all i can think is that they need to get over it
4052	1	wow this is me im good at work because i have a clear role and clear expectations but i get so anxious and insecure in social situations im not very comfortable when it comes to letting people get to know me either
4053	1	just do it  you can honestly read about parts 1 amp 2 and watch parts 3 and on it is really a one of a kind series
4054	1	i always thought that episode was fucked up when grandad told her to take control of her life and take responsibility bitch take responsibility of what being abused blaming luna for what happened to her when she grew up in a cycle of abuse even so she was still a bad ass awesome woman with a cool life and beautiful   the message that women are at fault for the abuse they suffered or survived was loud and clear during that one smh fucked up i saw this episode prior to getting into a horrible domestic violence relationship and thought it was funny seeing it afterward brought me to rage
4055	1	exactly lol did you give your social media as well
4056	1	definitely seems to be a regional thing to me i grew up in houston and rarely saw interracial couples growing up even nowadays people tend to stare at my brother and his wife when theyre out together cause most black people you meet tend to date inside their race it wasnt until i moved to northern california that i started seeing so many bmwm couples to the point that they seem to outnumber black couples imo black love is strong in the some areas of the country and weak in others
4057	1	my hair tanglesmatts up way too much with wash n gos maybe if my hair was shorter itd be easier when i want dreadlocks again ill consider the style but in the meantime its too much work to deal with for me and for a lot of type 4 womenive lived my whole life natural so trust me ive considered that option multiple times theres a reason why so many type 4 ladies dont do the style
4058	1	theres a difference between saying what you said hurt me and here is why and calling someone a jerk and ass the name calling is what is wrongi never said he was right to treat you like that  he sounds immature yall should just break up honestly but you sank down to his level when you called him something other than his name that does nothing but escalate the situationjust because i point out something that you did doesnt mean im defending him its not that black and white
4059	1	gtjust sad that all the black guys ive encountered in my romantic life only wanted to hookup and nothing more or they wanted my nonblack friend more than methis right here i have no racial preference when it comes to dating but so far in my dating life the black men usually by the second date say theyre not looking for anything serious so we fucking or nah but as soon as they find a light skin or girl of different race theyre ready to settle down i confronted my cousin on this at one point he was trying to mess around with any dark skin girl but as soon as he got the attention of a light skinned girl he cuffed her at light speed i asked him what happened to enjoying his youth before he turned 30 as he had told me not too long before he got serious with her and he responded there is something about her that made him want to stop and be with her pretty sure her skintone was a big deciding factor
4060	1	thanks so much

4063	1	black women have even fewer leadership options even in high profile spaces but we still get the work donegti would have to say the most difficult part of being a black male leader in the community is how do you assume authorityprobably because we tend to be more invested in results than authorityampx200b

4073	1	so my point stands by gatekeep blackness do you mean having mods represent who they claim to represent because it seems youre already on the defensive and were just 2 comments in it wont get better youre all american and none of you are with black so if you think that is gate keeping for me pointing that out then that is a shame

4085	1	it is nola is its own world and the rest of the state kind of trashes us even though it needs our recognition and tax money
4086	1	thank you lt3
4087	1	thanks for sharing your story it is disappointing childish and hypocritical but here we are
4088	1	i would talk about it with your friends are they white or nonblack poc maybe they dont know any better or if theyre black maybe they think it is between you and that guy and you could handle it by yourself how about say something like hey remember xyz yall said nothing and im just wondering why that hurt me and im still upset about it having my back in a situation like that makes a differenceapologies are great explanations where they own up to not knowing any better or thinking you had this however wrong they were are fine stuff like oh i didnt hear him say it when you are 9999 sure you know they did is not i didnt realize you would find that racist i dont know maybe is acceptable according to how old you guys are and whether theyre willing to learn from this and step up to the plate in future this is by my standards as a mixed lightskinned girl anyways i dont put up with copouts or excuses that may not be true or anything short of a willingness to listen and learn this is your body and your selfrespect and if you dont look out for it no one else will this has probably cost me friends but oh well you know yourself or you are in the process of getting to know yourself go with your gut and what your experience tells you
4089	1	gtshit shes about to join us in paris next yr cuz we already said shes going to experience the world from an early agethat is so awesome i cant even imagine getting to travel the world at ten she is going to benefit from this perspective in ways you cant imagine i am so happy for her
4090	1	colleges dont just accept people based on test scores and gpa they look qualitatively the answer youre looking for though is that people are racistharvard is on trial for considering race in it is admissions but the affirmative action law doesnt apply to colleges and honestly doesnt even work the same way
4091	1	gotcha thanks for spelling that out for me
4092	1	oh yeah definitely ive experienced casual racism here and there as a kid which made me a little averse of being in a predominantly white area i also had people that would patronize me because of my race especially a white teacher that i had in elementary school i could never win because people were either being racist because they were trying to be nice and others were being racist because they were being rude  there were times that i tried to downplay my own heritage or straight up ignore it because i didnt want people to see me as an other even though they probably did already i always felt like i had to fit in with white people and i was always worried about their preconceptions about me i remember one time in high school we were talking about our heritage in biology class and i hesitated to tell the class about my nigerian heritage the teacher was the same teacher that thought everyone in africa lives in huts and poverty im pretty sure everyone talked about me afterwards too because my white friend that wasnt even in my class told me she heard that i was nigerian and then i felt like the token black person when people were asking me if i was part of a tribe or if i speak nigerian even though nigerian doesnt exist in my neighborhood we only met one nigerian family at a neighborhood gathering and we never saw them again every time we meet a black person in our area we always tried to get their contact information i dont think its something a white person would get
4093	1	thank you and thats why i shot for an hbcu right off the bat spelman definitely seems to give less scholarshipsaid which has me leaning more towards howard
4094	1	yea but imo they are
4095	1	yes i definitely need to talk to a counselor and  find a therapist im comfortable with i feel that my habits are very damaging i keep things in that are bothering me and i ignore them while trying to do well in school and trying to work hard at my job but once im alone everything just comes back at me and i get emotional its going to take some time but i really hope to find ways and help of letting my hurt go and finding peace and happiness at the same time im scared of taking that leap because im not used to letting people see how vulnerable i can be but i know im gonna have to do it for my sake thank you so much for your reply just reading these responses makes me feel like what i am feeling is valid and im not the crazy one that is what i needed the most have a great christmas and a great new year
4096	1	no problem hope you like it
4097	1	uworstmodonreddit is prolly talking about rblackit im subscribed to rblackladies rblackfellas and rblackit but im a lurking mofo i personally wouldnt care if any of the subreddits went private because i usually dont have much to add and i just upvote stuff
4098	1	32
4099	1	if i were in your shoes and i was more knowledgeable about celebrities and public figures in social media i wouldve done the same thing you did though im just not very extroverted irl so that translates to my participation online i also agree we have different emphasis and concern but that doesnt mean we dont approach the situations in at least similar ways like ive explained in my previous comments
4100	1	honestly this was really enlightening and im glad i made this post im starting to see the importance about being intentional about looking for a partner its something id want in the future its about balancing other individual goals with that thanks to everyone who responded
4101	1	if i could upvote you a million times i would
4102	1	thank you im trying to live my best life and being more positive
4103	1	no i dont i just use cakes as my canvas  and thanks
4104	1	the only problem with all of that is the total hypocrisy going on in this statement you dont see any other princess dataing outside of their race not even in frozen it is just tiana i call bullshit until i see more princesses in interracial relationships im just going to have to call bull on this a majority of black people date within their race and black panther though not a romance film had a black couple in it so there is no way that they couldnt put a black man there instead of naveen why single out the only black princess and not let her have a man of her own who she identifies with like the other princesses it just doesnt make sense to me
4105	1	that sounds very convenient but have you considered that your cousin just says all they do is go out to eat and get paid she may not tell you the true extent of her relationship because shes ashamed of it too i will just be honest it is extremely extremely rare to find sugar relationships where men simply pay you and give you nice gifts for going out to dinner or talking to them sex is almost always involved whether they may not start out with that sugaring is sex work thats why i hate when sugaring exploded in popularity because it has led to this increase in naive girls who are getting taken advantage of on these sugaring websites there are very few legit sugar daddies on the websites btw and definitely none on seeking arrangements if thats the website youre mentioningto me it sounds like what you actually want is a boyfriend who will listen to you spend time with you and actually have a relationship with you as a sugar baby your sugar daddy will not be doing that for you you will have to listen to him whine complain and talk about his day you will have to be the one to cover his loneliness they do not pay you or give you nice gifts in order to offer you emotional support without even having sex in return im sorry if i sound harsh but i think people need to start being more realistic about sugaring it is not a glam movie where you get luxury bags and vacations just for looking like an older guys eye candy it is work with sexual favors often given in exchange for those perks be sure this is what you really want before you jump in headfirst because you will be very surprised and might even come out much lonelier and sadder than when you went in
4106	1	gt  its not morally wrong to discuss itreally big reach there i never brought up morals i just said im tired of it we shouldnt even focus on it every day all day it is just who wont date black women and why they wont date black women none of it matters why focus on people that hate you general you theregtif they are abdicating responsibility and not addressing the issue eitheri feel like that is another issue and should honestly be discussed more than the same ol tired black males wont date us shitgtas for the response when you talk about nb men and their racism well youre hanging around the wrong people then why dont you make a thread about it thenthat stuff is said here in this subreddit
4107	1	it does because white veganism continues to exclude nonwhite people from veganism ignores the plight of marginalized folx over animals and ive seen a lot of white vegans talk down on said marginalized folx for their diets without acknowledging the effects of oppression edit include everyone in veganism make it accessible for all
4108	1	as i mentioned im not a techy so you will have to ask others in that sub the  salary range for a junior level computer science position is 59k to 74k all rates of pay are posted online and that category is called a cs01 my understanding is that you could make more in the private sector also you can only negotiate your salary once in the public service and that is when youre brought on permanently so you should google the salary ranges for higher positions to see if it is worthwhile
4109	1	gtcan i call you my niggah holy shit  this guy is fucking ridiculous i dont like to give internet people my picture but i like to tell them im black early oni remember i posted about learning soanish and this brazilian guy messaged me he was learning spanish too and would like to practice his english i was all for having a learning buddy and helping him with his english and after a few messages of him trying to flirt i let him know im black this guy immediately start talking about my low iq and throwing the n word around like a native english speaker
4110	1	how do you propose that black veganism can be introduced and utilized in black communities
4111	1	i 23f go out alone all the time loli go to art galleriesmuseums festivals just went to a masego concert alone last month coffee shops movies etci go out w my guy friend but around the holidays he goes out of state to visit his family since none of them live here so thats when im alone the most now i enjoy being alone but sometimes there are just things i want to enjoy with people my female friends always have excuses or are always w their boyfriend and hardly make time for friends although all of them damn near live with their companion i try to meet people when i go out but i just dont find people who actually excite me even the music i listen isnt big here afrobeats my family doesnt even listen to a lot of the music i like im aa my only friend that i have really fun and adventurous times with just moved over 1000 miles away i guess i should ask how to get past the basics in communicating with strangers that i actually may want to be friends with at my age everyone acts like they have their friend group already and i think thats lame it can be fun meeting new people
4112	1	also wanted to mention none of my friends and family think it is an issue i think it is one of those things that you notice about yourself but no one else cares
4113	1	really i didnt know
4114	1	gt so many allies disappear at the first sign of trouble or even join the enemyi wouldnt consider her an ally like ever at all she is proven time and time again to not be an ally to anyone
4115	1	someone gilded this shit
4116	1	have we met
4117	1	sorry i fixed it omg im not a womanizer
4118	1	yes if i dont want to deal with the passive aggressive consequences of not going for the next few months
4119	1	gt rich people literally have zero perspective despite all their fancy schoolingi agree with you to an extent their perspective involves having money and this is why i hate that pull yourself up by your bootstraps advicehow do we gain perspective if our friends and circles reflect our tastes income and interests i went to a pwi but i wasnt rubbing shoulders with a ceo is daughter
4120	1	lmao hope you kept this same energy when michael richards made that joke about hanging black ppl from the rafters years ago at that comedy clubor is it different when white people joke about black oriole
4121	1	did you mean enemy
4122	1	lmao link to video
4123	1	exfoliating definitely does help sugaring is a little expensive but im going to switch to that shaving was cool but i really dont want to cut myself lol
4124	1	this
4125	1	honestly its true though im not gonna lie people can sense when you arent confident dark skin isnt inherently ugly i can say this because i am dark skinned myself im not treated badly because of my skin color but i also think it is because i was raised around white people and colorism is not a thing in the white community ive never been bullied for my skin so i never internalized that self hate thing
4126	1	that was my point
4127	1	youre creating a false dichotomy between open fields and megachurches that are basically shrines to personal achievements youre ignoring the fact that people have valid criticisms of megachurches gtno i dont think any pastor should be getting paid millions or even something like 200k but its been stated several times on here that he didnt use church money to buy the car so im not sure why this specific point continues to be part of your argument it came up because you brought up pastoral pay heregt but i believe he should be paid for the job he does and responsibility of his congregation that is on his shoulders and not mine preaching counseling hospital visits etc thats a lot of heavy work and i want the lights in the church to be on when i get there lol a church is an organization real talk takes money to run like one as if anyone was arguing that pastors shouldnt be paid you muddied those waters ampx200bgt the irony in all this is since he financed the car like and idiot he probably literally only put down a few thousand on the car i dont see the irony here at all he still committed to a multiple thousand dollar monthly payment on an extreme luxury item
4128	1	this may seem unwarranted and unsolicited advice but i feel it  may help and be a good help to anyone on this threaddont be too upset a large portion of the male side of dating sites are either men in relationships looking to cheat men looking to hook up but willing to lie about looking for love or men looking for a bangmom to care for them there are people who are actually honestly looking to date and have their stuff together but it is a small amount of usersi know this sounds so hackneyed and cliche but you just have to live your best life honestly and let love find you you dont ever want to be the one chasing in a relationship especially to someone like the peope who are prevalent on dating sites love and happiness isnt something you can force together to work if you do youll find someone to love you for what you do for them but youll be unhappy or youll be happy with someone who doesnt love you and theyll probably leave at one point let your light shine and attract someone who will both make you happy and who will love you it took me a long time to figure it out and it helped me find the perfect person for me
4129	1	thank you the level of mental gymnastics some people are doing in this thread to justify the gap in socioeconomic divide between black women is disgusting
4130	1	gthow powerful it is to hear when youre one of the forgotten ones that someone sees you loves you sees value in you and how vulnerable that can make us to demagogues and hustlers so true
4131	1	it just means theyre from a country in south or central america that speaks spanish or portuguese could be white black asian or native
4132	1	agreed
4133	1	thanks
4134	1	i feel like you can make you own dating app using the method you used on yourself and if users have the same success you have it would probably take off lol
4135	1	we used to have a kik and it was great
4136	1	ding ding dingmlk at stanford in 1967 the speech is on youtube actual live video i might add and it is a very good one
4137	1	oh i love this game
4138	1	im not gonna take victim blaming from someone who has no idea of who i am or who doesnt know the whole situation and as far as im concerned we are broken up to say that we are equally at fault is ludicrous
4139	1	he honestly dont look right when shaven so i hear you still love him though
4140	1	i dont like the beat the lyrics or her voice in it
4141	1	i use neutrogena hydro boost spf 50 and i recently bought emilia naked skin spf 50 both are relatively inexpensive and dont leave a white cast would recommend
4142	1	it is interesting to listen to normal people tell a part of their life story they have people from different backgrounds and nationalities talk about different parts of growing up having a family chance encounters and lost family history some of the stories are sad and some are funny but it gives you a look into another person is life for a little bit
4143	1	powerful
4144	1	its always crickets when theyre asked to describe what about us is angryaggressivethreatening other than the mad black woman stereotype that is attached to us
4145	1	your story is a friendly reminder that america is a plurality let alone the southi get uncomfortable when the reasons for kicking it with whom you kick it depart from the usual friends or colleague type stuff and slide into social climbing ickidk would you come clean to your guy about your feelings
4146	1	i applied to clark atlanta as well so i guess either way id be in the loop
4147	1	back then women tried to marry  the strongest toughest and healthiest either because of a sick mindset greed no choice fear or was attracted to those traits theres many stories as to how they were successful and unsuccessful it was often looked back as abuse if a black husband allowed his wife to work for the white man many elderly men refused their women of associating with white people out of fear i cant say this mindset was often put out but it was a significant amount in a small town my folks originated from they were more reserved and barely had contact with white folks unless for work and that talked was through men which was thought of as protection
4148	1	im very tired of the vegan community tbh im on a vegan diet but there are some parts of my life that arent fully vegan yet   some vegans will treat even vegetarians like they are serial killers  on top of that a lot of em like to equate black slavery with meat eating the sub is so weird sometimes
4149	1	i grew up in mostly white areas in san diego and then my teens in a mostly mexicanfilipino area had black friends but there wasnt many of us growing up i met my gf in chicago and chicago was my first culture shock being with her in dc was my second growing up i never went to a store where more than a 18 of the employees were black in chicago and dc places had all black employees  black people pretty much everywhere i never knew what i was missing because i could always fit in with the people around me i enjoy my white asian amp mexican friends back in san diego but it is a different vibe when im around majority black people regardless of what group im with i act and talk the same i have cousins and my younger brother to a degree that assimilate in a way that makes me uncomfortable id want them to stay true to themselves and not act in a way to fit what someone else wantsampx200bof the family born in sd one cousin and i are the only men with black women were the only ones with any longevity in our relationships him 10yrs and mine 7yrs then we have cousins who say black women are ugly or they dont want nothing to do with black women they focus solely on white and mexican women only thing i can attribute their stupidity to is their surroundings and the psychological effect its had they dont understand or dont care how disrespectful it is to their mothers aunts cousins themselves etc theyve been called out before but they dont care
4150	1	educated black women especially in tech are going out to sfthe bay itll never hit atlanta numbers but youre bound to see an increase in many fields in sf youre bound to come across the liberal racism more so than the in your face kind in a work place it is a balancing act of what when amp how to say something especially as a black women without being labeled as combative or angryregardless of where you live if you have a good support system around you itll make things a little easier knowing your worth also makes the microaggressions you may face easier to deal with some people arent worth the time and effort
4151	1	sure
4152	1	its like knee jerk reaction for some to defend black males its crazy especially when they act as if black males rarely date out
4153	1	why dont you date black men and why arent black women on this post jumping down your throat about it
4154	1	do you exist literally only to troll
4155	1	exactly unfortunately there dont seem to be many such accounts or if theyre out there theyre swallowed by the algorithm ive been playing with the same idea especially since there arent many around why not start a blog or insta accountpersonally it is more for inspiration im trying to switch up my style a little and build a wardrobe with classic pieces and quality over quantitytrends that is why im looking
4156	1	you shouldnt hate yourself because of your mental illness thats a pretty valid reason other people have dropped out for stupid reasons and had their parents support them financial but your doing it in your own  thats amazing
4157	1	not everyone has gotten a chance to see that movie yet
4158	1	dont know why youre downvoted
4159	1	i dont know why youre coming after me i am on your side and agree with you i was just simply pointing out the flaw in juttymire logic
4160	1	im glad they got rid of his ass
4161	1	i agree with you about not throwing other black people in front of the bus around white people i never do this but within a black space like this conversations like this are necessary
4162	1	my problem is that there is a lot of moderate room between poor and buying a 200k car when i first looked up the whole thing i saw people tweeting to him saying they were members and couldnt pay basic bills gtand what if he does tithe and what if his church does give much to the poor and needy as a christian myself i dont think this matters it was a terrible decision as a leader even if he is checking a few boxes you dont just tithe and walk away stewardship is a thing gtrappers and athletes get praised having expensive things but a pastor gets put downyes they didnt build their careers in service or religion gt and where is the line is it okay if he has a benz an escalade yeah the optics are bad i guess it is hard to say but it is definitely a long way below a car that costs as much as the average american house gtbut if he really used his book money and not the church is salary why are we telling him how to spend his money because he is a pastor of a religion that teaches stewardship service and the dangers of riches i dont think a pastor has to be creflo dollar level to be making really poor decisions and setting a terrible example
4163	1	girl they have never been to the courts they agreed on an amount for years and he didnt come thru its not an extracurricular they both work full time its her childcare for the summer its not an option and he surely didnt organize shit if she didnt
4164	1	ahhh this what i was looking for very tough case and apparently her history of abuse was left out of the original case so i see how they could have come to firstdegree murder  personally i think it is more of a seconddegree murder or voluntary manslaughter
4165	1	marriage existed before capitalism i think it is been more of a woman is rights to own property etc issue
4166	1	how is it weird for a black woman to say shes frustrated with her same race male counterparts black men were highlighted bc 99 of the people here are black theyre basing it off their own lives the op of that post probably mostly if not only pursued black men so what else is there to base it off ofwith all due respect your account is only 17 days old you have not been on blackfellas long enough to claim certain posters would never allow black women to be spoken negatively of because it has happened in the past you may not be that guy but not everyone thinks like younow im not saying bfellas is bad or theyre all misogynists because theyre not i am also not saying that blackladies should perpetuate any negativity that could possibly pop up on that sub the overwhelming majority of posters on bfellas are cool levelheaded people who support women  but i have personally seen some that are not dont believe me search through the sub using the filter black women most of the posters are chill but every now and then a hotep flies under the radar a man who insists sexism is not as pressing as racism or outright misogyny occurs this is not meant to be a smear on that sub but they have had their issues with supporting women and are not perfect and no i dont think bladies is perfect either this sub has its flaws too honestly considering you were the one who posted the original thread about saying positive things of black women its starting to seem like you just wanted to be thanked for your efforts one black woman expressed her frustrations under a sub made to center black women and a lot of people made it bigger than it needed to be if you were really genuine in your message then why create a parody post on bfellas of the im tired of black men post
4167	1	all those examples i listed are things it takes privilege to do that is kinda my point if you have the privilege to go vegan you also have the privilege to do an awful lot for other people but that isnt focused on in veganism not saying vegans dont do those things but a special diet doesnt do those things veganism isnt a cheat to being a good person
4168	1	this is super helpful thank you
4169	1	can you find any birth certificates of great gram was he born in a hospital he has a record somewhere that is what a social  is for
4170	1	be careful he may just want a way to americato waste a nice girl is time
4171	1	wow white created nation wtf is that guy on this nation was created on the backs of slaves
4172	1	rwomanism but it is dead
4173	1	hey nowyou sound upset and im far from willfully ignorant in fact im not ignorant at all this is not personal im just asking the questions that no one seems to be asking and thinking critically and biblically about the topicgtit is unethical and illegal to take organization funds from the church and use it to buy things for yourself so whether it is 20 or 300 it is unethical unchristian and illegal to take money from the church and use it on yourselfdid you miss where he said he didnt use the church is salary money to buy the cargtif he wanted to drive lambos pop bottles in the club have a different woman every day of the week and swim in a pool of gold coins then he should have chosen a job that allowed for thatyoure really saying that he lives like a straight up heathen rapper because he bought his wife an expensive car that is a reach or maybe you didnt mean this literally gti can spend my money on whatever the hell i want to and let me tell you why because i am not a pastorplease show me in the rule book which is the bible in this context where it lists the things a pastor can spend their money on and what a layperson can spend their money on of course im not saying a pastor should be blowing his money in the strip club just because technically the bible doesnt say not to but in this particular case were talking about a luxury car as i questioned before is a benz okay is a navigator okay or does it have to be a honda and does john gray need to ask the internet before he buys it just because he is a pastorim not going to keep going because you seem upset if you think he is wrong okay im indifferent because of the reasons stated in my comments on this post and that is okay too
4174	1	i used to do that i will get back on that i always make sure i have a jar or coconut oil in the house
4175	1	there was one part where they took a moment to recognize things like non profit organizations you tubers that bring awareness to mental health issues the rise in asian representation in the media and and i think overall diversity and how far theyve come in equality but in the bit there were not many darker skinned people so thats what made me go  about this video in particular
4176	1	agreed anyone black person who associates with them gets the side eye from me plus youd think that their obvious fetishization of black men would be a warning to many it is very disturbing
4177	1	wow
4178	1	i really really want to know what this means
4179	1	just the one
4180	1	i definitely agree with you i am also in therapy for my social anxiety and mental health issues thats good that you have good self awareness how old are you i was asking because you are thinking about medical school its definitely doable
4181	1	how depressing
4182	1	chase
4183	1	trust me i understand what youre going through more than you think ive been in gradschool and for the majority of the time i missed that constant camaraderie i had with my friends in undergrad i was constantly missing my social life i had in my bachelors my friends got me we got each other we actually went out and did stuff i would have people to go to parties with or go on weekend getaways and all that jazz i had such a great time and my friends were pretty much on the same page as me however  when i went to grad school it was the complete opposite i missed having that social supportive network  grad school at least in my experience was very busy and full of acquaintances or class friends but it was hard to find a group that was culturally on the same page with me and when i finally did one of them had to drop out due to academic struggles and the second friend she needed to work on herself for a bit but for like 6 months  1 year when i had those stable relationships it felt nice and so normal   finding a man older man what have you is not going to serve as a positive distraction you are vulnerable right now that distraction will morph into a negative force that you would rather not have in grad school because you are vulnerable and lonely you will place more of your attention social needs and energies to this guy who is primary purpose is to have sexual relations with you that is all  nothing more   and plus if you want a stable relationship or romantic outing then again that is way different than a sugar daddy yes men are immature especially young men idk how old you are but you can look for men a bit older than you to develop friendshipssituationshipsrelationships once youre at a better place    ampx200b
4184	1	nah black males in my area are proud to scream no black women
4185	1	yeah i dont think we are either lol
4186	1	i follow that sub on another nameare you saying theyre intolerant to feedback
4187	1	any and he sadly trolls black women about it i think perhaps he needs a mirror
4188	1	oh come on now no one is in love with interracial dating and this talking point about blackladies is tired what you read here is an op who seems fed up about her options and black men is views on black women i dont understand why certain men like to invalidate the lived experiences of  women and act as if it not is based in anything if you dont understand where the op is coming from ask her instead of dismissing it offhand
4189	1	she is no queen bee at all lmao im more popular than she is shes just a girl i thought was decent friend material but she obviously isnt
4190	1	exactly and people think i dont understand because i dont have kids of my own i helped raised my brothers and saw my mom care for us solo while still going out and having a life i dont even mind the kids most of the time but another issue is some friends are insanely cheap theyre not poor just cheap normally id understand but some of them are routinely making bad financial decisionsfor background my so is an officer in the military and of the people i meet are also officers in the military they make plenty of money yet some people i know claim it is not enough when theyre just constantly wasting it on new things without realizing living off one income means you must make compromises i understand that things happen but if you have a wife that doesnt work student loans for two people to pay for and kid maybe you shouldnt spend all the money you were saving on a truck while adding on a car note too whenever someone wants to do something the other parent stays home because they think a 2030 for a babysitter is too much even worse some of these people have even tried to get free drinks at bars from everyone else because theyre that damn cheap and obviously rude as fuck every one was the same rank meaning the also made the same money so messyon the restaurant thing i feel ya it is the only thing i can get people to commit to most of the time but it is ridiculous how much work it takes even worse some of the people that make the most excuses constantly tell me we should hang next time im taking out every damn receipt ive tried but i can only be hit up to make plans and then ignored when were supposed to meet so many times it is frustrating but im trying to be content without lowering my standards finding someone not racist is obviously hard but i also dont have time for people who arent actively trying to learn new things i dont think i can have a relationship that is only held together by drunk nights and parties anymore it is not fulfillingi wrote so much more than intended im clearly mildly salty but i suppose i will grow from this experience
4191	1	ya i get a lot of shade from people when they see that my so travel a lot some of them are quick to assume im just mooching off my dude is pay and that is why we can travel nope i just know how to allocate some cash for cheap flights out of atlanta i wish more of my friends realized they spent more than me because they eat out way more than i i just went back to school to and im on a budget but fun isnt always expensive groupon is ya friendreading what you wrote reminded me that some of the people that make excuses make much more than me too i guess if someone would prefer to have a 100 dollar tab every weekend instead of going to a city isnt compatible with me anyway thoughi actually got to see a friend today that has been super busy with their grad program we made delicious gluten free cookies and it was so nice to hang with someone who actually valued my time
4192	1	yasssss
4193	1	southern racism is either very to the point and blunt because people make zero effort to hide it or it is dressed up in religious dogwhistles at the very least when i had to be there for a bit that was my experience
4194	1	and saving
4195	1	the weather here is mostly beautiful when its not baking hot or raining hailstones the size of tennis balls but i do miss the restaurants shopping theatre and the crowds in london australia is more outdoorsy and family friendly each place has its merits
4196	1	hey sorry for the late response so i live in south africa where anyone with a drop of blood that is not black will selfidentify as that race it is come from decades of apartheidhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiapartheid and british colonization which really degraded so many people of color even now lots of black people are mentally colonized subconsciously believe that someone with lighter skin that them is superior or knows more than them in south africa that whole race of not black but not white selfidentify as colouredshttpsenwikipediaorgwikicoloureds  a special group of people who are not black not white not asian just a hodgepodge mix of everything what i find sad is that outside of southern africa they would otherwise be considered black what a culture shock they witness when they move overseas trevor noah has spoken about it a few timeshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpqmxud3fxhy and written about it in his book you can check out a couple of his skitshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyqcicflxfee and interviews and my coworker will start to seem very normal it is a messed up mentality and it is just sad because the coloreds are suffering from intense identity crises and reckon this is why my mixed coworker is trying to be as white as possible she got herself a white man with 4 white kids so she thinks if she spends as much time with them she will spontaneously get lighter and be reclassified as white absurd but it is true
4197	1	ooh youre in tech
4198	1	ive noticed that myself we only become ugly or undesirable when we dont want their horrid self its more a reflection of his lack of self respect
4199	1	lol i love you
4200	1	this is what i was thinking my so is an anesthesiologist and was just the other day telling me about how disgustingly overprescribed narcotics are i dont recall the exact study but he was telling me that prescribing tylenol and treating pain with that had overall the same affect as dilaudid or whatever but without the risk of addiction
4201	1	u know what girl im sorry i didnt click to see all the pictures that guy is gross and ignorant not worth your time at all
4202	1	right im watching this like should i go see this
4203	1	thank you
4204	1	this is what i always wonder where are all these penalties and all this loss from a pc world
4205	1	reading your comment helped me realize i could have used a better word than avoid people want their children to be educated without all the foolishness the choices shouldnt come down to wellfunded tokenism vs underfunded homogeneity disclosure i know a couple places in california northern virginia and pockets of the south is where middle and upper class black folks dont have to necessarily make this false compromisewhooey i agree with you on needing a place to be normal the girls narrator and sidney were metaphorically wearing a mask to school i saw something yesterday on here about a certain sub and it is similar in vein to what they enduredpeople having fun at your expense
4206	1	shes wondering why men avoid her if shes doing online dating then yes even okcupid found that men dock religious women more than race its in the book okcupid did on the data they found so a religious black woman isnt going to do so well im not saying g she should change im saying she should maybe consider that for men in general its not going to attract as many as she may be hoping for out of the general population if shes only looking for christian men and shes on a christian dating site thats differentampnbspas for the basic size 2 she didnt even mention the race of men she said men and i meant in general i attracted men not just black men
4207	1	yeah pastor or not financing it was dumb shows you really cant afford it
4208	1	sigh i feel the same way but also agree with the others in terms of the trolls that enter dsbw safe spaces to gain acceptance you must take a pic with your name and the current date
4209	1	omg ive been looking forward to it i pretty much have been at work like 18 hours a day since then i guess it is time to hit the matinee
4210	1	thank you
4211	1	that is so true about the idea we cant have a career and start a young family at the same time i feel like i need to finish school and start a career before trying to have kids im 25 by the way  ive been told so many times to finish school first and good on you for waiting i think the main reason im waiting to have kids is because of finances not health reasonsagei work in childcare currently so i believe this is the sentiment for working women because in the us maternity leave is 12 weeks unpaid depending on the company youre expected back before you are ready i think some women try to avoid that by being financially stable and firmly on their career path they are usually much older by the time both of those things happen
4212	1	you picked a nice pattern
4213	1	gender is a social construct completely invented by humans so i find any analogy to nature invalid there is no natural imbalance between men and women that situates men above us society has literally been constructed that way on purposeoppressive black men are not as small of a group as you think also i am not placing said oppressive men as a separate social class you literally took the definition of social class which i explained and changed it to fit your own ideology words mean things when black people talk about white supremacy do you say aw but my neighbor brian is a nice guy same premise if a black man is a good man he will not be phased when we criticize men as a social class if he does that is his problem to unpack male feelings are far from a main concern in feminism
4214	1	thank you so much thats really kind of you
4215	1	yeah but a response like that would require actual remorse and a willingness to growevolve
4216	1	gti dont expect people to learn about both sides here i expect them to respect and center black women im not learning about both sides matter fact i didnt even ask questions pertaining to white feminism i also didnt just type them up they popped up like i said a trend gtthen maybe youre not at a good point to be asking these questions in this way i mean that it is offensive to question black feminism on a black board without knowing what it is especially if you somehow find the time and energy to put in the effort to observe white feminist behavior you might as well say i asked wrongly because the topic will still be up regardless if it was included with feminism or not i just know when this topic approaches those continuously bring up our statistics like we dont know the others and i just want to conversate about it why not we are apart of it too whether are in it or not we still are in those statistics gtunderstood but i wont be making blind comparisons to white people any time soon i dont hold them up as a standard or norm i learned in school that its important to decenter them even in comparisons and im sticking with that i will accept that i compared so i will be using that for now on my comparison wasnt to spark interest in what black and whites women are doing my comparison was intentionally meant to spark up a conversation pertaining to our men not coming up through numbers due to the lack of them not being present or uninvolved for whatever reason all of us need to be aware of what white feminist are doing theyre doing funky shit if anything i know more about them than us because of the trend they are setting and theyre making effort and demands on our properties in the south it is annoying actually because someone from my perspective who doesnt know much of this movement is wondering damn where are we in the streets why is white women coming to our neighborhoods instead of my neighborhood coming together which is predominantly black women and children and hardly any valuable men its frightening sometimes gtthat wasnt my comment but you asked and got your answer from multiple peopleand i thank you all for that i handled we handled it without cursing and fighting i was a bit shy to show a different view point but i am realizing i have to come off with a more friendlier stance and watch what i say usually these types of convos end with a ban or deleted subject
4217	1	does beyonce pay you stan bucks or something it is not that serious
4218	1	this one hurt me and my ancestors lol
4219	1	wtf does what other subreddits watching us have to do with anything
4220	1	not really world is apart you just make it seem that way i know you didnt mean it literally that is my point it is stupid
4221	1	not in my experience ive been to japan twice i have lots of friends who lived in japan military and i dont think anyone ever experienced anything like that unless someone was drunk at a club and trying to be flirty some japanese girl wanted to touch this guy is hair and honestly that kind of shit could happen in the states given the context so no i dont really think the whole rudely soliciting thing is very common at all
4222	1	nooooooooo
4223	1	mind you this is just my personal opinion i dont think it makes sense to prefer one over the other when youre talking about race people are people and if you say youre mostly attracted to black people for example that is a fetish and not a preferencethat said there is nothing wrong with fetishes but if you ignore the human behind those psychical traits youre an asshole and there is lots of people like thatsame goes for being tall in my opinion im 6foot 4 and i will always swipe left on a girl who has height preferences because fuck that there is things about me that are awesome and great that dont have a single thing to do with heightand to me people whore like i want this or that are people that will never be able to respect meknow me as the person i am and why would i waste my time on someone like that just so i can empty my balls i can find decentnormal humanbeings to have sex with without me being fetischized over some appearance trait
4224	1	i never said your story is my story i never compared myself to any of those you cant relate gt i didnt entertain men i knew werent good for mei never said you did i just said theres numbers of women who knew what they were getting into i see you didnt comprehend my first sentence because that is why i been speaking of other women who was awaregti didnt know they werent good for me until i was already in the situation question when you was in the situation did you see some signs that was weird about him or he had traits you didnt agree with gtyour story is a story it is not the storyin the beginning i didnt give a story i gave an example and spoke for 10 women who had the same story to you and mine we are not alonegtthere are plenty of women and girls being hurt by people they had no idea were dangerous or bad until they were already in too deep experienced women ignoring bad guys does absolutely nothing to solve the situation those women are inout of those women and girls how many can say they had fathers and mothers who showed them how a family a relationship a parent work together and the father and mother doesnt have to be married either or co parent but the women and girls can say their parents influenced their lives and how many can say they had positive influencers or surrounded by one or was taught the proper way to detect glues to prevent loveless datingmarriage i can look at the statistics again but it is not too many from many sources  the point is if a woman or a girl arent ffortunate receive or witnessed love and healthy relationships then most likely they arent capable of filtering out men do you have a different opinion i just want to discuss here by the way i agree with you but i cant agree everything with you that is how discussions and convos work gtexperienced women ignoring bad guys does absolutely nothing to solve the situation those women are in women shouldnt have to be hurtscarred in order to build up a wall and learn who to ignore men should just freaking do betteri just want to say yes its sick for us to bear pain in order to see our own reality breakups cheating and the what ifs to prevent but you just gave a solution without even knowingmore experienced women should educate they have and are younger women and older women to learn what to avoid lots of the information or advice has changed from our grands and sometimes parents hell the government broke our little dynamic of a family structure and how to build it so in some ways we as women are are still suffering the affects from that without men   ex finances family structure and children may or may not have a deadbeatno women should not be scared but it is our reality because we are all going to do what we want or need we cant escape that and try to make every last man do right that is unrealistic right so the only thing you can do is help others educate others and healing yourself to be able to want to do it i mean you just helped a woman right now a lady on this thread didnt even know men like this existed theres more women then men the more women informed the more that can learn how to avoid even the slightest signs the more they learn how to provide for their children without being frustrated over a dead beat the less men will try to play those games why because we know every damn trick in the book that is why some change for the better and some with the narcissistic behavior go to another race that fetishes them anyway we dont have to teach men shit they will learn by not receiving any attention and sorry for this long ass statement im passionate about it
4225	1	ummm where are you theyre always being discussed as in the anti blackness in nb and white communities no ones giving them a soft pass either discussing the why can help us realize why certain people feel that way so that we can recognize red flags more easily in a relationship or other form of companionship a racist and misogynist black person wont just pop in your lap and say hes racist and misogynistic this analysis serves black ladies and other nb ladies well because it gives them a warning plus if someone feels dejected because theyre not getting accepted by men they can start to realize its the men and not the color of their skin thats the problem basically they should avoid misogynistic men
4226	1	i am so excited to go to an hbcu i only applied to one pwi harvard just for shits and giggles but i know my heart belongs at an hbcu
4227	1	i know im just making it 100 clear for everyone we can have respectful discussions about unpopular opinions but the mods will always take a hard line against homophobic transphobic racist sexist etc comments the culture of this sub will sour otherwise and this space is meant to be safe for everyone especially marginalized people if people with more problematic views can learn and grow here great but dont expect us to handhold you out of your homophobia and tolerate the potential harm youre causing with your ignorance
4228	1	gtbruh you have financial aid too its called mommy and daddywhy doesnt anybody want to talk about this like why is it still a big fucking secret this shit should be brought up every damn time somebody comes out their mouth about financial aid
4229	1	yeah i just cant with that bullshit im super judgy about raceplay and make no bones about it i have a deep mistrust of anyone who is into that shit no matter their race it was one of the reasons i got so angry that mollena was put on a fucking petestal like sure i suspect she has a respectable knowledge of the continued impact of the practice of enslaving our ancestors but the fact that she is the only poc who mainstream white kinksters are aware of seems gross i think they flock to her because they subconsciously some of them feel that she knows her place like ok i get that it is complicated at best but if you havent unpacked that shit several times over and are doing it with an intentional awareness then youre just perpetuating and subconsciously contributing the idealsbelief systems that are killing us the worst are the people who try and argue that it is just in the bedroom there is no way that hateful bullshit doesnt carry over into real life and your daily interactions with people ampx200bso yeah frustrating is an understatement for me
4230	1	im nigerian as well and we do the same thing
4231	1	i think she is just saying they can still be black and ignorant i think she is trying to say we should stop trying to revoke people blackness or act like black people cant have stupid opinions too she is not saying we have to think their opinions are valid
4232	1	yes they do
4233	1	i can barely believe you said that lol i honestly think he is the most handsome dude i have ever seen pto each their own though d
4234	1	no one does but that doesnt mean you cant meet people i didnt volunteer at a homeless shelter expecting to meet someone but i did and weve been together for four months i guess its just me but i dont see the problem with approaching someone at a library
4235	1	not really but i need to sit and reevaluate my budget after my last paycheck first
4236	1	i feel like you were flip flopping back btw the church and a church the church is not equal to an official government the church encompasses individual churches as well and your fellowship with god those individual churches also contribute to the image of the church besides you said you werent even concerned about church anyway but about christians as a whole
4237	1	gtbernie sanders has no chance of winning thats not true his approval ratings are very high
4238	1	gt you cannot separate that out when it is inconvenient for youexactly if you wanted that kind of job you should have picked a different profession
4239	1	dude that is alot ahaha
4240	1	i dont necessarily believe he is lying about where the money came from i believe the choice to spend it that way was a terrible decision for a current pastor or preacher and reflects horribly on him as a leader regardless of how genuine he is or what his messages have done for people he is already admitted to his own immaturity in how he relates to his wife and i believe this is an extension of that issue i just had a similar discussion with a pastor i know who lives in a very moderate house in a moderate neighborhood and how he believes that he and his family could live on less this wouldnt leave them poor and he is not giving his home away but the direction he is looking says more about him than anything else he does he mentioned another friend who pastors and made a lot of money from a prior career in finance he also lives in a very normal home and part of the reason is appearance and care for his congregation let alone setting an example after seeing this i have next to no doubt that john gray is facing a wrong and likely immature direction as a christian leader
4241	1	i didnt even know about this what the fuck
4242	1	lmao scam motivational speaker damn
4243	1	gtlike i said we are raising themare you trying to say that you cant raise black sons to be feminists or that you cant be feminist amp raise black sons we should always raise black boys to treat women with respect and treat women as equals
4244	1	you know that is part of it too i was closer to my dad than i was my mom so it feels weird to not include him when im talking about my familyim sorry for your loss
4245	1	even the name pap smear is the worst sounds like papa smurf trying to do a sex thing ew
4246	1	yes im told there was cotton
4247	1	yeah i really dont think she is that different than most of us pretty much all of us are out here with our ideas of trust being shaped and limited by past experiences
4248	1	no just employment
4249	1	thank you this is what i was trying to say guess im a pick me and a handmaiden for having a different point of view individual black men and women are allowed to be aint shit without it being a reflection on the whole group that is subtle internalized racism enough people hate and generalize us now were doing it to eachother
4250	1	black men being a group and then as i went deeper i mentioned children and black sons black son black men we are raising them which is why i mention family not to mention we are speaking about uncles brothers fathers etc here they all count in that statistic if you cant see that then idk what to tell you
4251	1	this post is a wordim a 22 yo lightskinnnttttttedddd mixed black guy long time lurker first time poster and i will be the first to admit my fellow brothers will curve tiffany for jess my personal dating preference has always leaned toward darker women i have yet to date a pure alabaster white woman a lot of my homies try to convince me that i should go wid a white woman i honestly dont see a reason to not because i dont find them attractive but because i dont want to have to explain why x is racistproblematiccolorist etc etc and theres many other cultural things i just dont want to have to explain maybe a lot of other black men want to do that but when im dating or am in a relationship with someone i want to have a very intimate mental connection with them sometimes that can be through culture sometimes that can be through a myriad of other things  regardless i want to feel like i can relate and connect to my partner on multiple levels a vibe if you will i really dont get that with any of the white women ive met to datethe unfortunate reality in some black house holds is that some black fathers say horrible things about black women to their sons who then grow with a preconceived notion of how black women act a stereotype if you will my dad did this to me and it really took me some time to get rid of the picture in my head my father painted of black women and even more to make my own i hope these men you speak of will find their way one day soon but until then hang in there sis
4252	1	while gendered issues are welcome for discussion here please be careful you arent slipping in anti blackness please reach out in mod mail if you have questions about why this comment was removed
4253	1	that makes sense cosby used to be on all the time and disney was good back then
4254	1	whose
4255	1	gt no clue about crabs in a barrel it is the belief that when one person tries to do something good or better themselves or be successful somehow someone else usually of the same race kind etc will pull them down or we pull each other down and none of us make it out of the barrel not sure if op was specifically mentioning it in terms of black people but ive heard it said about us
4256	1	thisssssss
4257	1	im more articulate in writing than in real life lol but thanks good luck
4258	1	there was a comment on here like back when black panther was in theaters about how much of a turnoff his weak chin is
4259	1	i actually found it to be be very transphobic and white
4260	1	ooh thanks for the link yea the lack of rep is a problem especially cuz im spending so much money i wanna have a better idea of how this stuff is gonna look its ridiculous
4261	1	definitely get the handbag
4262	1	yes because making a joke about the colorism in casting is spreading misinformation about fictional characterssarcasm
4263	1	is that possible im asking out of ignorance i always thought only mixed girls had 3c to 4a hair both of my parents are black and im completly african born in west africa i thought i would be more near 4b 4c 4d because of my heritage granted ive never seen any girl in my family without relaxer or braids in their hair
4264	1	basically that my handwriting was like the tracks that a crab is feet would leave when walking on a gully
4265	1	i agree to an extent a lot of those negative things you mentioned are products of white veganism this is why i favor intersectional veganism there is of course a fine line between bashing people and telling them the truth
4266	1	im almost ready for a rewatch but ive been putting it off
4267	1	like i really hope those who date outside their race have the best and wholesome intentions and not use their biracial children as some social experiment i have noticed that a lot of the white techie men date asian women that isweird not that they date asian women but likewhy so many i met one couple and his girlfriend is from taiwan and she is amazing honestly id fight anyone who messes with her lol
4268	1	thank you i can barely walk or look at whomever im supposed to talk to also dont understand the map holstering and unholstering  at the wrong time is also kicking my butt my hand eye coordination game is laughable also how do you know youve done everything youre supposed to do ive been walking around the camp in chapter 2 lost as hell i tried doing the mission with uncle and the girls but i keep losing the dude on the horse and have to start all over
4269	1	what does that have to do with what i said i didnt fully comprehend because i disagree with single parenthood i believe both parents should be involved or have some type of interaction of the sex that is not involved in the child is life
4270	1	maybe my routine is harsh lol i do a lot because i really try to attack the acne  plus i have hyperpigmentation so im just all messed up what do you make for your face please help me lolololol
4271	1	i have heard this before that in england people try their best to use other descriptors and use skin color as a final one i can imagine that it can be a little bit exhausting though lolhow do you see yourself in your head an how would you describe yourself
4272	1	i agree with the points here im not christian so i dont have a dog in this fight but i think the issue is that people are arguing morality here and there is no compromise possible some people think pastors should desire to live way below their means emulating christ while others like me think that having wealth is fine i know a few wealthy pastors from canada and the us ive met the bronners a few times too and they all have their own side hustles the money in tithes and offering goes to the church to pay the billsfull time staff they work a lot independently to have what they do likea loti think the issue is that the black community as a whole doesnt understand the financial principles their own pastors are using the pastors i respect are not the ones who deny having money meaning they have rich clients and those they hob knob with i respect the ones who make every effort to reach out to the community and teach people how to make money of their own buy a man a fish and hell eat for a day teach a man to fish and hell never be hungry again you know
4273	1	the rest of the song is pretty good in my opinion maybe im biased but yh picking only 5 was a struggle i only included malcolm in the middle because i saw someone else put it there were so many i couldve chosen
4274	1	gt i think what is making black girls insecure is our own men tbhyou throw out one random distractor story to push more of the black men vs black women agenda ive heard black women say the exact same thing about seeing bm as brothers ive also heard the same from indian middle eastern and asians about themselves what all of these self haters have in common is they have a hierarchy of people engrained in their minds this is ridiculous because bmbw relationships are the most common black men arent making us insecure they are affected by the same self hatewhite worship that many of us and other races have been spoon fed throughout history we are still in the unlearning phase skin bleaching in african and indian cultures eye surgery in asia the preference of dating whiterlighter all of these are examples of the current effects of eurocentrismnow onto the real story viewing black people as inferior was a very common practice in the not so recent past many other races were raised to value whitenesslightness by their families antiblackness is prevelant all over the world and its not being perpetuated and spread by black men the hispanic man original subject of the thread probably grew up in a household where he was taught that blackness is somehow lesser this is very common in hispanic communities especially those who try to deny their own african roots it is ridiculous to turn this on black men it just shows that you have also been effected by self hate you have the same hierarchy of people engrained in your mind and you try to justify your self hate by directing it at the opposite sex you are no different than a self hating black man you should reflect on your willingness to defend a racist nonblack man by scapegoating black men
4275	1	thankfully she is not my friend she is a closeted racist hiding behind the farleft progressive banner she only likes black people particularly black women when she feels like she has one up over themand she has extreme white guilt which i i think is to veil her racism
4276	1	ive got a friend whos on holiday in botswana right now and he says that it is pricy but the lifestyle is worth it he lives here but goes back every year for 34 months i think it definitely worth a visit i really cant wait to move to africa just writing about it fills my heart with such joyedit also from your perspective whats the problem with zimbabwes banking systemeconomy

4280	1	gti see my friends spend money on so many pointless things and im just in my head likewow the concert was only 25 but you needed another purse although you have x amount of other purses etc its not my place to tell them how to spend their money though and i have to respect that its just frustrating when there are so many feasible things we can do to create memories and they choose not toi had a friend a while back comment to me that we must be rich because we were  taking an international trip almost every summer she ignored the fact that we either couchsurfed or stayed in hostels traveled during offseason and saved all year for said trip the two of us went to amsterdam with a 2 day stopover vancouver bc for 2500 round trip total like for both of us including food travel and lodging the friend who was criticizing me has a smartphone monthly expensive bill a very expensive aesthetic and was famous for making statements like i dont eat leftovers  but no were the rich ones
4281	1	gt there are so many avenues in local and federal government that there really should be a sort of program for teenagers to actually become part of the system because once youre in you may be inspired to do morei can get with this make the opportunity available for them to learn more but keep it optional
4282	1	im already in qwoc and hope more ppl join thanks for the suggestions
4283	1	i hope you got rid of that toxic person  those kind of people suck the life out of you
4284	1	you forgot the last reason they want mixed children because a lot of them think mixed children are better than fully black childreneither way i dont mind ir relationships date who you want
4285	1	do you listen to his music he says all the time he cheated  he speaks often about his philandering ways while his now wife waited on himwere on and off they met in college if anything he speaks from a place of i was a fuck boy and i dont deny it
4286	1	im really suspect of this explanation because if it were true you could expect to see less homophobia in majority black countries and regions as opposed to more in some cases we need to own our homophobia black women included and stop trying to pass it off on white people or historywhat i do think happens is that the areas where black american men get the most praise sports and raphiphop are more fertile ground for hypermasculinity which then opens up more space to treat anything seen as feminine badly those areas also have a large amount of cultural influence on black men either way we have the option to change things
4287	1	trust me im as surprised as you are  but im not worried knew the meme was a joke but i felt the op is pain and accountability vetting and knowing my worth is considered shit everyone has an opinion and im entitled to mine
4288	1	exactly it takes research to make sure you have a real midwife because the term isnt regulated people dont know that
4289	1	it is hypocritical of me but i am tired of everything being laid at the feet of black women alice walker does not have the power or reach that most antisemites who are overwhelmingly white in our country do to me it is disingenuous to lump her in with them im not saying that to excuse her reprehensible views i am just saying that as a fact to me it is very similar to how a black person can be prejudiced but they cant be racist as they do not have the power to do so in societyalso speaking as a professor so many writers in the literary canon are racists violent alcoholics rapists sexists domestic abusers etc if we were to throw out their work because of their imperfect humanity andor despicable flaws then we would have nothing left to teach and read noone is perfect what is more important is trying to understand why they have those views in the case of alice walker how is it that a black woman who gave us the term womanism and speaks out against sexism and racism is so blind to her own virulent antisemitism how does she hold these thoughts in her own head considering her own daughter has a jewish biological father more importantly because we all know someone like her elderly or not how do you reach out to those folks and help them understand that ignorance and hatred is wrong do you cancel your grandma or uncle or the dude at church when they are talking ignorant foolishness or do you try to work with them compassionately and steer them towards justice and light
4290	1	are you daft feminism does benefit men but it doesnt center them call it an incidental effect if you knew how to read you would see that i said that in my third paragraph but go off sweetie
4291	1	my so is a comedy writer so she is making her way through the industry as well there is a huge lack of black women
4292	1	this is like one of the most popular opinions on reddit in general lol i love beyoncé though
4293	1	your comment helps a lot i work with exclusively white people and i just found out literally about 10 minutes ago my white coworker makes 5 more than me an hour im big mad but its like you said i have to know that its not about me she makes more than me but its not because im inferior in anyway
4294	1	just because it bothers me that someone has painted all white people with the same brush doesnt mean i dont fundamentally understand why someone has done that  ive caught myself doing it enough times with men when ive been sexually harassed for the umpteenth time or as a lesbian when heterosexuals undermine my relationships as hot or to get attention similar to racism these things compound and i know all too well how satisfying and necessary it is to vent in that way but the more i reflected on it i realized it really does a disservice to me and my cause to alienate potential allies by making public sweeping generalizations when im fed up with a few people from their group it is so easy to get carried away and then be guilty of the very thing we are angry at others for doing to us i think and hope you will see from my post history that im consistent in this view and it has not just been brought out in this specific context and again i recognize that this is your space and that the goal here or with a post isnt always to improve relations that sometimes it is simply about the rant and the vent so im not judging im not even saying it needs to be changed as these are my personal views i was just asked a question directly by op and i answered it honestly even acknowledging that my emotions were offended but that logic prevailed i wrote a lot in my original post and the sentence that got the most attention was not intended to be remarkable i get the impression that you ladies dont have a lot of strong white allies and that is really unfortunate and honestly it makes me sad angry disappointedmany things first because it highlights just how difficult it is trying to combat racism in your lives and to find some solidarity and second that it seems to make you skeptical when a selfproclaimed white ally appears again i cant blame you that is your reality and you have every right to be wary id love to be able to reassure you that as an educator with a degree in history and social sciences that i have put in the work and time over 15 years to get a grip and deep understanding of the various injustices of the world i am paying attention i am having these conversations both as a speaker and listener every single day with my peers my students my family and my friends i am an active ally and even though we will disagree occasionally i can tell you that we want the same things thanks again for engaging in some discussion with me i appreciate your patience and kindness and willingness to inform even though you are under no obligation to do so i have no other way to assure you of my allyship but i hope you and others are willing to give me a touch of blind faith and know that im committed to it for life
4295	1	ive never gotten why other minority groups would be resentful of black people in this regard black activists have consistently put in the hard work that the rest of us minorities benefit from we owe it to black people to have their backs we need to support them not be like wah what about us
4296	1	hey thanks i guess i was horrified because i work in lightening similar to in the dressing room fluorescent and everything i thought of myself was shattered its hard to cope for me since ive struggled so long with my hair and not only dealing with loving it in all its curly mayhem but having it short i never asked for it so its hard the compliments fed me and were a replacement for my own self esteem so i definitely should learn a balance
4297	1	theres only three other black ppl who work at my store and sadly i dont work with them that much one of them is a sweetheart and she helps me out whenever im in a frenzy
4298	1	i hate it  i hang it a lot of groups that have a good amount of eastern asians i was partially raised in japan and there are so many people that very quick to complain about black people having so much visibility it is not even positive visibility and it is not like we got this far by just being nice black people have had to work incredibly hard to be treated  just a percentage of how well other people may be treated people dont understand that were are always under a microscope wherever we are and people will always be quick to blame any problem on our color
4299	1	which is why you must teach not bash people like me that all im saying theres room to improve on how to avoid situations like this i gave a reason why men act like this and i gave a solution all in one breath i made the mistake myself multiple and i was one of the ones that knew the minute you stop entertaining the better i did it for the attention but eventually it got old when guys tell me theyre not like other guys that is the first sign right there lol hell
4300	1	this
4301	1	i think it is both probably the two parts of this article that i thought were most relevant was the part about recruitment where i was like why not hire a 26 year old black marketer in addition to your black technician and this bitgt black donors are also limited just 17 of the donors available at the california cryobank as of this writing are listed as black or african american brittney thornburley a queer black woman described these database searches in a personal essay at autostraddle last year in that little dropdown menu where you choose the race of the sperm donor click black or even africanamerican if thats what you fancy and watch your dreams of little chubby black babies wither away to dust as hundreds of donors narrows suddenly down to um 11 or sometimes four one of the larger banks i know of has two up for offerat that point even a reasonable request like someone with a skin tone roughly similar to mine might be out of reach
4302	1	so how much did you lend and how often did you get it back one big payment or smaller ones gimme the deetshttpstenorcomyqm5gif
4303	1	neither it is a line from his stand up
4304	1	seconding this if i could do it over i definitely would have included single sex schools on my list
4305	1	i dont think white americans becoming a numerical minority would necessarily affect beauty standards it might even make them more desirable since they would be rarer  just look at latin american media at the end of the day i guess ideas of beauty reflect who is in power and even if becoming less than 50 the american elite would still be white
4306	1	fascinating  this is an amazing historical analysis of what was going on at the time wonderful new insightsthankyoui cant say that i do nor my mom or grandma id love to do more research though   this is an excellent jumping off point
4307	1	youre right in that most compassionate people would find this appalling it just added an extra level of wtf
4308	1	never once made my comment seem like some type of competition
4309	1	i will say it seems like ir couples are more common than same race black couples ive only ever lived in california
4310	1	i dont think we can say wash and gos arent for type 4 hair as a rule as i said im also a type 4 with very tangleprone hair that shrinks up to 85 of its length and yet tangles are a nonissue for me with the style im also part of a natural hair community full of type 4s with hair of varying lengths  mostly 4bs and 4cs  who have the same experience so it really depends on a lot of factors beyond curl size im not trying to attack you or tell you what to do with your hair so i really hope im not coming across that way my comment is more for those who are reading this with our hair type who may not realize wash and gos can be an option for them i used to think it wasnt for me either i stuck to twistsbraidsprotective styles because thats what supposedly works for type 4 hair but those styles broke my hair off and stunted my growth as with many things its best to try for yourself and see how works for you
4311	1	doubt that would happen wouldnt be surprised he is reelected  with possible recession and bounce back during his tenurehe is in a good spot for his campaign to use whatever publicity goood or bad to sell his political agenda followthemoney and most voters say one thing and turn around to do another anyways
4312	1	just the wear and tear of teaching lol
4313	1	oh i totally follow that and i think that saying its just a joke is very flawed and simply an excuse for whatever offensive shit somebody has to say however it was said in a comedy show  and the funny bit was that donald enjoyed that his girlfriend said that to him  because obviously he should be appalled it really depends on what the audience should find funny the funny part is that hed let himself be disrespected like that because its kinky to him i didnt know he degrades black women i mean apparent from his rapping he mildly put has a particular interest in asian women i havent seen that clip from atlanta only season 1 is available where im at but if youve got a link id like to see it
4314	1	that is because it is crazy wow why cant hair be left alone
4315	1	i dont like texting a lot theres a lot to say that is important
4316	1	biracial kid here if you do end up having kids with your husband and he does end up feel ashamed of their race or treating them poorly because of their race then please get them out of that environment and leave him my mom was white and my dad was black after the attention of having a new baby subsided my mom realized she hated having black kids she would shame me for my hair and my wild animal tendencies her parents and sister would call me ugly and unruly as a kid you just have to accept that what adults say about you is true that experience was horrific for my self esteem so if it seems like your kids are being made to feel unwelcome in their own home please get them out that said since this is a fear you have about your relationship i think its reasonable to assume your husband wont actually dislike having black children there will likely be a period where he has to adjust to how people treat him and his kids and learn how to react appropriately you will have to show him how to pick up on kids and teachers being bigoted towards your children and show him how to protect them however ive seen many biracial couples with kids who have managed to do this quite well just not mine
4317	1	id like to find a safe outlet to release my anger and sadness into id like to learn how to sew find some inner peace budget my money and take better care of my skin
4318	1	i was disappointed in how lil rel is character went out but i thought they did a good job with tom is characterhe didnt sacrifice himself for random people the way lil rel did at that time they barely knew eachother it was more like he sacrificed himself for their makeshift family i also liked that he was a leader from the jump
4319	1	hmm i never observed it changing with the sun i mean it just looks the same shade when i was younger and wore sunscreen it did change according to my mom
4320	1	good decision honestly defending homophobia is so wrong i cant believe it is still a hting
4321	1	neither do i but i agree with op
4322	1	you dont though so the cashier at the gas station thinks youre a bitch because youre not doing a little jig when you come up to pay for your stuff and who are they why do they require that much emotional labor best thing ive ever done for my self esteem is to learn recognize the people who are going to make demands like that for their own selfish edification and deny them access im not going to internalize some stranger is passing impression of me because i didnt perform vulnerability for them lol that is not where my precious energy needs to go im polite im courteous that is all they can expect
4323	1	obviously not my point is these men generalize black womanhood with such strong misogynoiristic convictions yet it seems like they forget their mothers are also black women
4324	1	ive seen it on tee shirts but more often i admit as memes on social media  anywhere i see it i hate it
4325	1	noted

4329	1	im glad it is not just me im always surprised when im attracted to somebody
4330	1	yeah im bipolar with ptsd on top and i definitely got ppd my job that ive been at for over 3 years now has a lot of my ptsd triggers so it is been a mental hellscape im trying to find another job but it is been slow going
4331	1	what are you up to in the last few hours of 2018
4332	1	thank you
4333	1	three legged safaree haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
4334	1	i dont understand the obsession some men have with not being perceived as gay if youre not gay youre not gay some grown ass men cant even eat bananas without worrying about being seen as gay it makes me wonder if everything can be seen as phallic or pertaining to a gay sex act for these men maybe they are actually gay and closeted secure straight men dont worry about things like that all the time it is baffling like the whole saying pause for every damn thing hey man i like you shoes pause
4335	1	but youre attracted to what youre attracted to to most people physical attraction matters personality can make up for someone not being your type but that only goes so far like im a lesbian but i cant date a stud again the sexual attraction just isnt there and personality isnt enough for me to look past it
4336	1	i was just about to post this she was shameless and admitted she used her white privilege to steal
4337	1	i really relate to this but im not quite sure how to overcome it either im mixed too with grandparents who moved to the uk as part of the windrush generation the problem is that my relationship with that side of my family is very strained after then abusing my mother emotionally and physically for years so i essentially missed out on learning about any of my caribbean roots i even feel like a fraud calling it my culture because how can it be when i never grow up surrounded by it ive tried learning more about my families history but it all feels so distant to me
4338	1	sometimes when people take us to new heights it is terrifying to be without them because you feel like how can i go back to that the thing is you dont have to this person expanded your heart not so you could shrink it when their gone but to keep it growing into your next chapter i feel you i am going through it as well it is painful but the only way out is through it just dont close your heart
4339	1	im so glad someone else finally said it choosing a light skinned woman allows men to cosign white beauty standards while still embracing blackness and keeping your street cred what is really the difference between donald glover and matthew knowles is it black love if you thought she was white and were attracted to her ability to passim willing to bet that if the marriage stats considered color and didnt lump all black women together it would be very clear especially broken down by income im light skinned and im not offended by this because it is the truth
4340	1	i heard something once that i thought was interesting guys wait for the right time and women wait for the right guy
4341	1	girl i can only imagine
4342	1	it was a general point my friend said that i thought i would mention in your own reply you relay they  tried to toughen him up so again i think the main thing is in being strong  and distancing from weakness as i end off saying  there isnt really a rhyme or reason to bigotry so i dont think anyome is ever going to get it
4343	1	thats great theres no reason to put down black men or even to make a broad generalization about thembut its just as problematic if not more to use the degradation of your black women as the vehicle to try to do that thats whack af
4344	1	i never watched living single or martin
4345	1	wow did he really mention lusting after her bf is friend
4346	1	ha it looked like you had it handled but i chimed in since this is one of the few topics on reddit i actually know something about
4347	1	hi ya im the creatormod of rafrodisiac and also mod rgonewildcolor we would love to have you in both nsfw subs if youre still open to posting
4348	1	the more i learn about hbcus the more i regret not giving it more thought when i applied to collegesafter the whole donald glover black women wont date me thing soooo many people came out of the woodwork to talk about how folks in band really get down i knew that famu is band sounded good but apparently after instruments were disassembled and reeds puts away well it blows my red solo cup pwi days out of the water
4349	1	thank you
4350	1	sure and same here if you make one let me know id love to see how you go about it
4351	1	whew girl but this is the 100 truth if i wasnt broke i would give you gold for this message
4352	1	thank you my family has a similar background it taught me that my race cannot stop me hard work and determination will get me anything i desire my parents and grandparents had it so much harder than me and they still made it if they can become successful like that without even a fraction of the support and opportunities that i have in 2018 there is no way that i cant do the same thing
4353	1	well i dont know how you did it but you must have real good control of your hands the facial proportions are solid her hand looks perfectly correct the open mouthsmile looks perfectly done not wonky or shaky or anythingand yeah painting cakes is just as good as anything else or even better cause we cant eat canvas lol if you love it go for it
4354	1	if the black demographic on reddit is slow where do black people spend their time online
4355	1	to be honest ive seen more self hate on this subreddit and elsewhere than displayed by any black man with the kardashians
4356	1	can someone help me parse thatis it that people are rallying behind him because he is experiencing deserved backlashalso i found thishttpsrvamagcomwpcontentuploads201811facebookscreenshotpng which is utterly priceless
4357	1	sorry rinterracialdating
4358	1	gtyall are a lot of work and you gotta wait for us to mature to be ready for youampx200btranslates to were lazy and well take whatever is easiest or who has the lowest expectationsampx200bthis isnt even unique to black men but i really think because of racism they have the most access to the most women with lowest expectations the fact that theyre super slow in checking for racism when it intersects with sex makes it even worse
4359	1	a great time to have a crack at dming yourself if youre willing to throw yourself into it and make mistakes it is a lot of funi remember the first time i dmed it was in dampd 35 during university with the players of a campaign id just finished i was good at doing the story side of things but i had no real concept of how difficult monsters should be resulting in a random bartender almost onehitkoing the wizard and the final boss going down in less than five hitsit was hilarious everyone had a great time
4360	1	gtwhy should he apologize give me a good reason i dont think he should have he should apologize because it offended alot of people  that is not a good enough reason because a lot of people also found those tweets funny back then consensus doesnt constitute fact plenty of people laugh at edgelord videos putting benny hill music to actual 911 footage just because you get a laugh out of someone doesnt mean what you didnt isnt problematic in some waygt ifyou find his material offensive than dont support him he has a right to make a living how he sees fit this assumes every critic supports him in some way and as a form of protest dismissed poor people who dont necessarily have much choice in their economic decisionsgthe stopped making gay jokes years ago and people are still trying to find a reason to drag him under the bus it is stupid i agree with him you should want honesty from your celebrities not some fake apology posted on twitterinstagramif we want honesty then he shouldnt make an entire career out of shitting on women gay people and all other forms of ironic bigotry then own up to it literally only after he faces consequences for it his apology rings hollow when he also made posts saying how people are just pretending to be mad when confronted with genuine criticismits the same shitty tantrum every comedian pulls when marginalized people are tired of being shat on
4361	1	the grinchs fingers and right i hate those posts too
4362	1	white men will get the boys will be boyslads narrative and black men will be the troublemaker time waster or not serious enough amp usually threatened with sanction
4363	1	very little in what you wrote addresses what i said especially since i said nothing about small churches or churches as a whole im talking about megachurches specificallygtthey just think pastors go to church on sunday morning preach and rinse and repeat but its much more than that theres nothing wrong with having paid staff and pastors the problem is where their priorities liei come from a family of pastors and preachers and am intimately familiar with church budgets large and small and what it requires to run a church even one with very strong branding as well as the time they put in this is off this topic but i dont believe for one second that john gray puts in any more time or effort than the pastor down the street who makes a middleclass salary and drives an average middleclass cargtpeople like preachers that are recognizablethis is the problem if this is what is going on it is how you know a church is sliding away from its christian mission and into entertainment gtunfortunately there are pastors that abuse the system but that goes against the word of god and other members of the christian community do not stand by themyes they do i think youre misrepresenting how christians operate how megachurches most often function and ignoring what i said christians have to stop this not all christians defensiveness when one of us messes up and own the issue if not black christianity is headed down the same road as white evangelicals
4364	1	yeah i understood that is why you didnt wanna go into details totally makes sense maybe my comment was out of place somehow i did actually mean more general in life about the sharing and some people not caring not here on this subreddit i definitely have nothing bad to say about this subreddit either you describe it well
4365	1	i am attracted to black men im just not interested in men that make it obvious they would never date dark skin black women just as if a white guy said something similar to me i would never date him which believe me i have heard as well im from a super white area there is not a ton of black men around me unfortunately the black men ive talked to have said some pretty shitty things about black women probably because of the pressure to fit into white norms but it is not acceptable
4366	1	i acknowledged not all black men are like this but its happened to many times in my experience
4367	1	omg full video 200 worth itampx200b
4368	1	that is a nice sentiment but i think you are seeing that not everyone is worthy of your help  let people earn your help trust etc  we women tend to want to help or nurture then we are resentful because they take without giving back
4369	1	right it is terrible because the employer didnt initially suspend him at the start of their investigating they only suspended him after more people started to find out about it
4370	1	i understand you completely life to short and ppl like your ex make it shorter im not a religious man but even the proverbs say dont let the sun go down while you are still angry if he want to be angry go be angry by yourself cause the best kind of relationship is one with 2 forgivers imo
4371	1	i wish tobut i dont wanna lose my job lol cannot reply to this fully rn as i am at work and its busy here but sadly i cannot do anything about it
4372	1	gt i was thinking of those situations too however this is a different case i dont think it is and i believe that is where our main difference is but possibly also thisgtthe difference is that a church especially an individual one is an accountable bodyi am much less concerned with a church in the general sense than i am the church  that difference in perspective means well be talking about and ultimately protecting different things in different ways
4373	1	gt snapsplat lolmy best friend feels this way as well as she doesnt use social media i try to be more accommodating of her and the 1 or 2 other friends not on social media but sometimes i forget to update them on event changes that happened on facebook  are you in your late 20s30s age bracket as well
4374	1	title said they are nigerian names
4375	1	exactly you worded it better than i did
4376	1	i have one in a similar situation i really do worry about her white children latch on to racist jokes and stereotypes like theyre a drug partially because theyre children but also because racism is treated so lightly by the adults theyre around i also think part of it is them living in culturally neutral spaces too there is just too many reasons for them to treat nonwhite children badly
4377	1	gt racial freedom is only applicable to black men apparentlyive noticed this within my family almost all of my uncles and male cousins have exclusively dated white women its been that way since i was a kid but they have the nerve to say something about me datingmarrying a white man its so hypocritical one of my uncles is also the most political and seemingly woke man youll meet hes a journalist so hes great with words and always posting about racial issues but he never i mean never has dated a woman who isnt lilywhite all of his girlfriends have been very white like pale and redheads or blondes he told my grandmother that he just cant see himself with a black woman its bizarre and he acts very awkward around my husband and other white men like here we go with this white guy shit which would be fine if he had that same energy for white women but its fine when becky is doing it
4378	1	exactly if you didnt know that you might start feeling bad when a couple years down the road that same coworker paid off their student debt but you havent when the whole time theyre pulling down the equivalent of several thousand dollars more than you are a year for no reason related to your actual work also im a little surprised at all the it is not just race you just need to work harder and be positive comments here im half convinced it is just white women and a few respectable black women swinging by to fluff their egos this stuff weighs on you and sometimes you just need to acknowledge it to keep your mental health in check
4379	1	gtmy post wasnt meant to harm or show ignorance to black feminism but to ask qs for the sake of the good men i knowi think the sidebar safety rules can be a big help center black women and it is hard to go wronggtif you dont want to talk about men fine but it least can we come to terms that our little boys are endanger and will be thrown into these statistics the minute they hit 1316black women are already doing the majority of the work in caring for boys and the girls who will grow up to be black womenampx200b
4380	1	youve had an account for how many days
4381	1	stop centering men
4382	1	caring about what non black people say or think about us ltltltltlt
4383	1	thanks
4384	1	not to be dismissive but i feel like the twin cities is one of the worst places i can imagine for black people selfhate tends to thrive in whitesolated areas like that and i feel like thats what youre seeing i had a friend who grew up there that thought she was ugly for being dark skinned because of how awfully she was treated only to move to dc where practically every young single black man we met would flirt with her
4385	1	i wont elaborate here for a number of reasons the biggest being that what you wrote is triggering to both rape victims and gay men having the conversation here gives your thoughts a platform rsocialjustice101 exists to allow these questions space you may also want to lurk rrape and rmengetrapedtoo but dont ask this there that said you are welcome to acknowledge your uncle is experience but not to exploit it how he frames his own story and takes back control is his right that is not what youre doing youre twisting his words to reinforce homophobia and to revictimize because you are removed from the context of it actually happening to you
4386	1	i suppose i can see that but i dont really feel that it was a deconstruction of using black women and justusing black women the moment pearl came back into play the fact that she was portrayed as a victim for having grieved her girlfriend or whatever took precedence and she outright tries to make excuses saying she cant help herself garnet is feelings that she split up over get ignored for this and even when called out on it their resolution is garnet saying she is not as strong and having to fuse with her abuser again or she would have been crushed to deathi get that it is a development moment that pearl asks for garnet is consent first but i feel like that moment was undermined by them being in a life or death situation to say nothing of the other elements like sardonyx talking down to amethyst every time she is onscreenhow garnet pretty much has no reaction to this afterward or how the two nonwhite gems fused to make a giant ghetto black monsterif there was a line like pearl you dont even care that you hurt garnet and are just trying to cover up your own problems and instead shifted from garnet is abuse to pearl is victimhood and being confident so i dont feel it is a message the show presented
4387	1	yep i just did it and i feel a really heavy weight lifted off my shoulders
4388	1	says black people dont own the hair styles but calls them black hairstyles
4389	1	that is most definitely the most disgusting thing i have everreadon the internet
4390	1	those people are allowed to have different political views and im allowed to call them a dumbass
4391	1	congratulations i know you must be so freaking excited youve worked hard for it i hope you celebrate accordingly this weekend
4392	1	i was raised in south central compton and inglewood my 5 brothers rarely dated black women now that were all adults ive relocated to the pnw my brothers still live in los angeles county none of them date black women
4393	1	gtit is not another man business if a toxic male decides to mistreat women he can not physically and mentally change a grown manbut that is where youre wrong it is no different from saying it is not another white person is business if someone else is a white supremacist  it applies to any group of people that has bad apples doing bad things how are these men supposed to change or even listen if even people from their own group are not calling them out also it helps the morale of bw to know there are other black men out there that are actively supporting them against this harmful behavior we need as many people as possible to stigmatize said behavior you already have prominent black men like taye diggs and donald glover adding fuel to the fire i dont think you should say he cant physically and mentally change a grown man like i said since one grown man will be able to connect more with another grown man without coming off as an angry black woman in order to defeat the stereotype more men need to speak out as wellgt ladies you can find a lot about a man through his childhood theres so many examples and hints that should warn us it is crazy men that cant communicate become angry easily become quite easily always on the phone feed your physical but cant feed your mental pointless conversations but will treat you etc this stems from household influences outside influences and society ive heard so many stories of men acting like romeo when the women first meet and then once they get married it all goes downhill men can be good at being manipulative even with the smartest women also are you going to ask every man you date about his childhoodampx200bgt from my personal experience men are bad liars this doesnt pertain to every woman but a lot of woman choose to ignore how many videos you see a black woman cry and give her testimony not even 2 seconds into a video her description of her ex is abusive the whole world can see the traits before a testimony is given point is we can spot it we may see it we have to learn how to leave it i get what you mean and it is true us females need to learn how to spot the warning signs earlier but the onus shouldnt just be on us men too even if theyre good need to be held accountable not just for the bad black men but for themselves so that they can change their own behaviors that they didnt even know they exhibited the last thing we want is even a good man being complacent about how he treats women that leads to nice guy syndrome gt this is not a good man responsible to pick up the slack from toxic masculinity it is not their fault issue or concern the most they can do is treat women they meet in their path no one said it was their fault though the last thing anyone wants is for one person to take responsibility or punish themselves for the actions of others no one is asking men to do that though however the onus should not be on women to take out the trash themselves men need to join them and do more than just treating women well treating women well is subjective for many men even the good men can benefit from learning how to treat women better more men need to speak out about this behavior so that more people know that this treatment is unacceptable especially the men in power we live in a digital age where everyone is connected they can do so much more than just being good to women in isolationgt yes it is hence why i said try other poc blacks isnt solely african americans you have natives africans islanders and aboriginals notice i said men besides depending on the area of the country in which you live youre not going to find many african americans let alone africans islanders and aboriginals

4396	1	it makes sense then they talk about him like a child because he acts like one
4397	1	its way harder to believe that you can do something when youre constantly receiving feedback that you cant or that it will be extraordinarily difficult exactly thats exactly what im talking about you should look up the obama effect it was a psychological study that studied the affect of positive role models and media images on black childrens academic success basically the study gave groups of black students and white students an exam they showed one group a video of barack obamas inauguration speech before administering the test the control groups were given the test without showing them the video they found that black students who took the exam after watching the obama speech did much better than both groups of white students and the black students who were not shown the video the study found that positive stereotypedefying media representation and real life role models can help close the achievement gap between black students and white students we have to be shown the things that are possible so we can aspire to be more
4398	1	thanks for sharing
4399	1	gtim 6foot 4 and i will always swipe left on a girl who has height preferencesi am hypocritical about stuff like this while i side eye racial preferences as a taller than average woman i need a guy who is my height or taller i just cant deal with the comments and the insecurity and the backhanded compliments that come with dating a shorter guy

4404	1	gt because im trying to shield myself from having any emotions when he starts crying and screaming againlet yourself have emotions suppressing them doesnt help have them so you can let go againbabies cry it is inevitable you take a deep breath you go down the check list if hungry feed if dirty diaper change if tired nap etc and you remember that how you deel with crying and stress is the example you set for your child that is why it is ok to have feelings you still function accordingly and you let those feelings pass
4405	1	i hear that concern but im not sure i care about people getting their feelz hurt it just feels like the lurkers trolls fools and shit starters have too much power in this sub that is not for them

4409	1	i should have added offset has an album coming out really soon that is my faultthe cynic in me says bssh who is now buying this album that wasnt buying it before the divorce newsbut i could be wrong maybe this stuff actually works it is one of those advertising maxims that are hard to prove in practice
4410	1	i understand that i was just critiquing the guys pointgt why should he have to apologize is a stupid thing to say because he has already apologized about this before
4411	1	steve harvey is a disgusting human being and anything other than the number one answer is  should not leave his mouth he is racist homophobic sexist classist you name it i still cringe when ellen ellen invites him on her show or collab with him he is so open about his homophobia ellen wtf is you doing sis
4412	1	idk either im on the fence i guess because ill catch myself singing her songs when its on but ill never go out of my way to play one
4413	1	it sure is the empathy gap between races always amazed me none more pronounced than in advertisinggt black people are not darkskinned white people  tom burrellthis was a revolutionary statement crazy as it sounds burrell was one of few black americans who worked at a major advertising firm in his day starting in the early 60 is eventually he built his own firm in chicago and attracted large corporations thanks to his insight on black people lol im cracking up at how ridiculous that soundsin oj made in america i remember the chevy and the hertz guys wanted to play it so safe in the 1970s you dont want to leave money on the table by ignoring black people but you dont want to alienate white people whooey those were different times also a reminder that damn oj was michael jordan of the advertising world before michael jordan he was that dude
4414	1	oh my hahaha i have a goofy grin on my face right nowwhat did your parents say when you demanded a horse
4415	1	right the point of the gospel is to bring as many people to jesus as possible that is all a mega church is doing succeeding at its call but because it is bigger then the small church down the block it is wrong meanwhile the same people love getting their daily inspiration from td jakes video clips but now all megachurches are bad
4416	1	the op may not have expressed what they meant in the clearest way but i do find it interesting how people were able to read the same post and some focused on the positive points and others the negative points could speak to what the op meant the lens in how you view thingsgtthere is a fine line between discussing how we internalize negative stereotypes and blaming us for exposure and ultimately suffering from the effects that stereotype racists love so much and i think op either stepped over it unintentionally in her post or is misinterpreting and possibly misrepresenting how and what people are complaining about on this subi also didnt see a post of people saying black women are _______ but i have seen the post along the lines of soandso implied black women are ________  and followup discussion that has is usually filtering catastrophizing personalizing and stating  ishould statements about soandso those are distortions even feeling undesirable is technically a distortion cause that involves filtering out your positive qualities and focusing on the negativegttake her example of black women being at the bottom of the totem pole every time ive seen that come up it is been someone dealing with pain vs making a statementyes it is the way someone is dealing with their pain but that doesnt mean that there may not be cognitive distortion in the way the person process it that could potentially be adding more painampx200bi know i sound like a positive patty telling you to focus only on good things im not im actually a quite negative person however when i really sit down with cognitive distortion and see if im going any them when analyzing a situation i see some truth to the positive patty horseshit i had a hard time looking for a job and i knew that being a black woman in a field where there isnt many played a role black women needed more qualifications for the same job and lower pay it is a fact but when i look back on how i processed those facts during that time i met it with cognitive distortion as ill never get the job and end up on the streets catastrophizing being a black woman in the field shouldnt make things harder should statements they didnt hire me cause im black jumping to conclusions i kept looking for things to support those thoughts instead of challenging them i never actually changed the way i thinking if someone told me that i was distorting things i would have punched them in the face but that doesnt mean they werent right  i just eventually got a job and didnt think about it anymore but i wonder how my mood would have been if i did challenge my thoughts cause they left me quite defeated the facts above are still true and affect me today but i dont distort things when i think about it  edit spacing and words
4417	1	and that is why i never heard of her
4418	1	gt the church encompasses individual churches as well and your fellowship with god i dont really agree with this definition i believe it is founded on connections between individual believers and groups of believers whether that involves a church or not that is what i mean by christians as a wholei also believe that a church may or may not be a part of the church but that all depends
4419	1	jesus christ theyre expanding everywhere
4420	1	you know what i was thinking about this whole situation and one of the reasons i think it is most important to openly critique the decisions of someone like john gray is so that pastors who are doing things right or only making minorly disputable decisions dont deal with the unfair fallout they sometimes do one of my close friends is a pastor of a large and growing church and he already faces criticisms and accusations that i know are completely untrue we had a long conversation about this kind of thing a few weeks ago and it is one of the main reasons i dont believe it giving gross offenders too much leeway or saying not all pastorsnot all churches there are people out there doing the work for real and they deserve as clear a path as possible i believe the only way that will happen is if were honest and direct about confronting what is going on in all corners of the religion one of my biggest fears for the black church is that we turn into the whitened tombs that white evangelicals have and genuinely believe that leaders like gray who gravitate toward the same people they follow need to be weeded out quickly
4421	1	i really second fb that is where ive met my current boyfriend of 7 months
4422	1	i find screaming children easier to deal with when i recognize the screaming for what it is a form of communication not the most articulate or expressive but kids dont have their communication skills fully developed they scream because they want to be heard helping them feel understood goes a long way with infants it is usually the check list of seeing if they need fed changed burped sung to or nap
4423	1	my dad always had side businesses because he was going to have to pay for college he basically worked part time he taught at a newrby community college my mom was full time housewife and mom daddy cooked breakfast though he did a lot of fixit stuff we had a number of road tripslots of exercisedad running cycling and swimming  lots of core stuff toomom walking yoga and aerobics
4424	1	im for that im on mobile so i cant see where its been crossposted for some reason but i think i know where it ended up and those people are goddamned toxic its like we have one space out of the hundreds of thousands of subs on reddit but we dont even have that
4425	1	ive never been to philly but now im curious to read up in the racism there portland is rough because no one wants to admit to their biases but they love to show off how liberal they are i feel like we all need some kind of retreat for black women only so we can heal a bit lol
4426	1	gtthat is as far as i could stomachshe is been mad since forever i cant watch her videos she can sometimes be right about things but it is always covered in hatred and angst
4427	1	yes this is basically why i asked the question i find new artists songs and genres that i wouldnt normally listen to and big brother is watching because i got a notification from pandora as soon as i read your reply
4428	1	it had a lot to do with finding friends that understood how i felt getting objectified since they were kids the harassment etc
4429	1	i felt that way when i watched it when i was younger the family matters ending is messed up to because laura marries stevewho essentially stalked her and ignored her turning down his advances the whole series
4430	1	gtpeople are people and if you say youre mostly attracted to black people for example that is a fetish and not a preferencei dont think that is a fetish though it is different from saying they only like black chicks as opposed to saying theyre mostly attracted to black chicks i think that is what youre thinking about if someone acknowledges that theyre mostly attracted to black people theyre only saying that black people have the features that they like the most however they are not saying they cant be attracted to other races and they can stil have an open mind someone that says theyre only attracted to one race is robbing other races of their individual characteristics rather than someone noticing a pattern in their preferences which black people happen to meet best that said racial fetishes are pretty much bs that is what leads to weaboos or koreaboos or nggaboos
4431	1	the best time to find a potential partner sometimes is not looking for one but enjoy the comments the gifts the dates etc from other men just be yourself let your femininity flourish and men will talk to you themselves wondering whose that fine brown woman in the corner with no mananother thing i did was i took dating the literal meaning i didnt say or claim a man who didnt claim me and felt comfortable with it so you can have as many dates as you want even have sex but if youre not up for that kind of game dont set yourself up for it even online
4432	1	dr death is wild i couldnt stop listening once i started
4433	1	i think what is not clear to people outside of north america is the any amount part you dont have to look significantly african to be black just a lil bit counts that is how we get conversations in claiming folks like vin diesel
4434	1	wait i might have miss understood you are you asking about people saying things like he is not black he is african that is a weird thing that is harder to explain
4435	1	oh word yeah i live in the us
4436	1	i only liked it when the kids sang it other than that i had to skip the intro
4437	1	thank you so much for this i just finished reading the mothers and it was so wonderful to read a book with characters who shared my race it is been so rare for me to see that but it is something i want to experience more
4438	1	i really like that divide and conquer bit in regards to situations like this can you elaborate more on what you mean please
4439	1	what about outside of your school uh where do you go to school is it an hbcu can you connect with black phds outside of your school maybe via linkedin what about on twitter what is your fieldi know we have a few on here but it is a saturday night

4442	1	here is onehttpsyoutubej0vikibei0u    this video came out in 2016 so hopefully theyre still around  hope they are  here is a vice videohttpsyoutubejhqi4w1ev80 that i think is about the same retreat  i know you were sort of being facetious but
4443	1	thanks ive had a sew in before but i wasnt working out at that time so thats something for me to keep in mind
4444	1	this is something i have sadly come to realize as a newlyout girl it sucks a lot especially when it is the latter
4445	1	wonderful to hear he has better friends with black girlfriends you won the war and the battle honestly self haters tick me off very interesting that your friend threw a fit lol ive noticed that happens as well with some women
4446	1	i might take an extra one to go if you dont mind
4447	1	yeah send it to me
4448	1	aw that is sweet merry christmas to you and your family
4449	1	yes and no i have kicked my ass in college but nothing happened for me until i networked i got the right internship working for the right people and everything fell into place however for many students of color we work a lot more than our peers time is money and every little bit of time you have helps many of my nonblack friends worked a lot less and had family support my black friends arent so lucky furthermore taking classes in stats opened my eyes to the level of discrimination we experience in stem shit isnt so fun when your teachers blatantly wont help you  but have no problem coddling your white peers and the peer study groups you arent invited to thoseall im saying is there is a lot of racism that occurs in some of these settings our people can do the best we can but from my experience there are definitely barriers to who will feel inclined to help you not to be a debbydowner just being honest about my more demoralizing experiences in uni
4450	1	agreed not a cardi fan but you know nicki had to be a smidge pressed that cardi got married and had a baby as quickly as she did i can see it all over her  nicki wants a family badly and she doesnt even care how she gets it tbh ampx200b
4451	1	her daughter is jewish wow howd you learn about this i cant believe the article didnt touch on this
4452	1	what white girl that did bantu knots
4453	1	with anotherhuman lol i think the new kirk is hot so id ship that or sulu evil sulu knew what was up
4454	1	same it really really sucks
4455	1	movie was awful
4456	1	question would people use hakuna matata as an everyday expression or is it more like a catchphrasecliché ie do people think of the band them mushrooms when they say it or is it just like that is how you say no problems in swahili either way im not understanding how a company can just claim this sentence belongs to us now and what is supposed to happen then
4457	1	he is a comedian they are offensive sometimes other time they are funny you cant have a comedian that always walking on eggshells because he feels like he might hurt someone is feelings that is dumb alot of comedians have said something homophobic in their stand up routines everytime one of them gets a chance to host something like the academy awards society cant be forcing apologies it is dumb what he said was offensive to some years ago ok we got it let is move on with life i think this news cycle of outrage at every little offensive thing is dumb
4458	1	please change this to say whitenon black trans women
4459	1	exactly it is a conflict even if he has the best intentions and was completely honest
4460	1	they lack any sort of nuance in their mind ive noticed obviously the indians had no problem with it i dont even see the problem with wearing clothing from another culture unless its sacred or youre disrespectful
4461	1	you not wanting to explain and not understanding the cultural significance and history of black hair are two completely different things a stranger and the mother of someone youre presumably serious with are also two different things yes you dont have to give her a reason but it is kind of a weird hill to die on honestly there are plenty of legitimate reasons to relax but being evasive and indignant is likely to make her dislike you if youre serious about the guy that is probably not the best idea
4462	1	exactly he could have gotten her the absolute nicest one and i wouldnt have much to say at all it is just all so extreme im amazed that people are even trying to defend it
4463	1	she needs to document to cover her ass not to try to bury him  he was shown up publicly who do you think will be given the benefit of the doubt in a dispute  you need documentation to back up what is going on  i dont think getting involved with hr is warranted at this point but if it should become necessary in future she is coveredfeel your anger frustration etc  give yourself a set time period to feel it  then put it behind you and move forward   be excellent and dont prop him up anymore  you cant change him how people react to him etc  you can change how you process it and protect yourself from excessive stress by not letting it consume you
4464	1	thank did you enjoy the game
4465	1	genuinely asking not trying to start something if her white family member is that many generations back do you not consider her black i ask because i m in the same position as her racially yet ive always been considered black and not mixed because the white in me goes back over a hundred years once again not trying to be picky but it seems odd to call her mixed if shes 1 white when a large percentage of us are 1 white or another race and consider ourselves black i hope this doesnt come off as aggressive or rude ive just had problems with people calling me mixed when the last five generations of my family are black and its really dismissive
4466	1	isnt cuban just the ethnicity which is different from race your ex was still regular white just from cuba
4467	1	cubans are not typically white it is the cubans you see in media from miami who left after castro who are typically white go to cuba the country is as black as jamaica which is swimming distance away
4468	1	on amazon there is one called naturally cute i dont know about any one in stores
4469	1	i would consider her black myself reverse 1 drop rule is different lol
4470	1	agreed very simple and concise i belong to the second group so i can use black as an identifier
4471	1	this thread has me a little heated tbh trump supporters are probably upvoting this but the sad part is that black women probably are making some of these comments very suspect nonetheless
4472	1	time will tell
4473	1	i didnt bother to read your because if your opinions were important youd get paid for them i am going to continue to enjoy this video and her music though
4474	1	i think i exaggerated a bit it is only 4890 when adding in shipping for one that is still like 20 more dollars than id like
4475	1	still not tracking what was the context of the glover quote and why does the post seem to be directed at glover then because if his girl didnt say anything then were just assuming all this about glovers relationship based solely on the fact that theyre in an interracial relationship and wed probably at this point just condemn every interracial relationship because of our assumptions
4476	1	ive said it before and ill say it again this isnt about you
4477	1	i grew up in los angeles and black men dating out is so common its an actual shock to see one with a sista
4478	1	lmao it wouldnt silence us wed still be able to speak about the things we want no offense but this is such a selfish comment this sub wasnt created to cater to you or help you learn about black people its for black women to have discussions among themselves the entitlement is real
4479	1	gtapparently there is dudes who believe that guys who go down are actually in the closet gaysthen im in year 3018 while everyone else in 2018 gay cause while i love piv sex oral is my forte
4480	1	yes because either way it looks like they are trying to hard like no distant cousin we still dont click in racial circles if anything i dont mind if they comment i rather know theyre here than just lurking that ish is creepy stop spying on my businessyou want to learn more about african american women look at documentaries books etc you shouldnt have to befriend someone to learn more about them racially otherwise it seem like your trying to befriend me to understand black people more that mess is crazy
4481	1	im british and even i agree
4482	1	how would you know that if you refuse to look it up
4483	1	yes not everyone has the same success story but the success story that people read may spark some sort of hope for individuals and also do not ever downplay ones struggle emotions accomplishments etc regardless of who you are you make it seem like ppl cant say that they struggled unless they were not raped spat beaten or homeless we all struggle in some shape or way lets not get into a struggle competition like you said we all have a unique story
4484	1	true lolwe all gotta start somewhere
4485	1	lol why do they do stupid things like this there is a reason people dont talk to each other
4486	1	i could give a shit about the feelings of black trump supporters i literally just do not care
4487	1	wtf this isnt even funny
4488	1	that is so cool
4489	1	im not suggesting looking down at anyone i also want to say that not everyone values the same things some people genuinely dont want to go to college or they are comfortable with the lives they live that is totally fine too i think its more than just hard work it is the belief that your goals are attainable no sane human being is going to work hard for a goal they think is impossibleim just saying that if someone does really want to do something different mindset makes a difference it affects everything if you have a goal that you know you are capable of reaching youll make different choices because you know the consequences of certain choices will make your goal harder to reachlets say a young black woman aspires to graduate college and get a 6 figure career and knows that she can do it she will make deliberate choices to ensure her success if shes sexually active she will always use protection because she knows that becoming a young mom would make going to college harder she will spend her time studying for sats she wont get caught up in the wrong crowd to avoid getting arrested or in trouble with the law shell be careful about what she posts on social media because colleges and employers are lookingsomeone who thinks things are impossible probably wont make the same careful choices the mentality will be it doesnt matter anyway i think that is a key difference when it comes to mindset if you dont think its possible you wont be as deliberate about your choices
4490	1	he was a good dude and we had a good time together but he just going through a lot of personal problems that he wasnt dealing with and it ultimately halted our relationship ive never walked away from someone i still really like and respect it was ultimately a good decision but it still sucked
4491	1	because we need a democrat who can actually win and put us back on a decent path people on both sides like biden bernie sanders has no chance of winning hell only divide the votes we dont need that
4492	1	blackhair
4493	1	self improvement will take you far
4494	1	i usually will complain by email to the higher ups but the note is specific to the wait staff
4495	1	if you read through the post i said that im not trying to assign this issue to the entire black race i said some black people some okay and as far as the weight issue goes i also stated that some of the chubby and skinny black people ive met or been around havent done this to me but noticably any time i have this particular touching issue it is done by a chubby black person in black and chubby myself so im only stating this out of observationgti dont see this as a black issue at all i dont think those people should have touched you if you didnt want them to but in some cultures touching people in a friendly or relaxed way is normaltrust me i know im haitian so all touching and kissing of the cheeks and hugs arent new to me but when people who i still dont know very well start doing weird shit like massaging me out of the blue or randomly sneaking up on me and breathing on my neck while im busy i cant ignore that that is too far and inappropriate im okay with normal hugs and greetings people touching me any other way even if they think it is playing isnt funny try actually being in those situations and youll see what i meangti dont see this as a black issue at allthe touchiness isnt exclusive to black folks i know white girls asian girls and one latina friend i know have been guilty of touching my hair out of the blue or trying to i dont excuse that but i also dont want to overlook another glaring problem that doesnt seem to be talked about as often in our community some fellow black people that i have met have invaded my personal space in a way that has not only made me very uncomfortable but counts as sexual harassment not all of them and not all the chubby ones it is just one common trait among the number of people i can count who have done this
4496	1	noone cares if you date out but stop trying to constantly justify it by putting down black men you should be able to date whoever youd like anyways but because you actually connect with that person not because black men somehow forced you into this situation
4497	1	and as noted numerous times now this wasnt just an isolated incident and it rings hollow when you proceed to say peoples feelings toward homophobia are just made up anger
4498	1	yeah it is
4499	1	gtthe fact that black men deal with racism doesnt excuse them from being held accountable for their sexism
4500	1	ill add my own anecdotal experience which ive talked about in this sub before i have a few uncles that loooove white women like stereotypical white women with questionable views and these same uncles hate white men theyre quick to call out racism from a white guy but when tiffany says something equally problematic they ignore it or make an excuse for it and i feel like i see this a lot outside of my family tooand so this person is description of how sleeping with that racist white woman is a way of i forget her exact works basically taking back some sense of power and masculinity from white men that completely makes sense to me i cant see into these men is minds obviously but her explanation of it makes a lot of sense
4501	1	yeah buts it is the first thing i thought ofthe cartoon that went around a few years ago with the white person far ahead on the race track winning and all the obstacles that black people had to fight through just to catch up
4502	1	i love this story so much i am not bold enough to do what you did but i think it is awesome how you handled that situation
4503	1	exactlyregardless of what he has to say at this point you have had trust jostled as my husband says you cant unring that bell  not worth any effort from you feelings wise remember he blocked you there is something premeditated here run far  run fast if youre looking for his lovethe most he can do for you is professional tips and professional networking  he wasnt giving you bill money he was compensating you i bet he fancies you a sugarbaby at best  decide whether you want this job my guess is no because isnt being straightforward or respectfulit sounds like you were looking to build a romance he isnt willing to supply thisreject disrespectyou deserve respect and anything else you want
4504	1	i just dont understand why in the midst of remembering someone is life you feel the need to go out of your way to talk about how you think someone else aint shit and then want to tell me to dry my eyes fucking ridiculous
4505	1	it is just really hilarious that so many dudes use this stuff to justify why they dont like black girls or decided some other gross generalization about women tons of people got rejected in high school by people they wanted that is what happens when you didnt peak at 16 grow up and stop confusing teenage girls with women
4506	1	i have a private one and trust me it wont be im just worried for the free spaces out of here its cringy
4507	1	lol ive never been brave enough
