6	1	just to maybe help fill you in on why people here arent as positive as you expectedgt i am writing a science fiction bookgt id like to name the main ships in honor of native hawaiian wayfarersgt i havent actually studied hawaiian folktalesit really does make you seem uneducated and its as if youre looking for people to do your work for free also have you heard of cultural appropriation

9	1	i lived in hawaii for 15 years  miss it like crazy  true it is unimaginable for most to consider buying a house but i feel like the real problem is there just arent any high paying jobs  i couldnt justify it anymore felt like i was putting off growing up

13	1	no it peoplelike you and rest of the reddit that are comfortable with the dumbasses like bernie tulsi and trump that think these people can be reasonable they cant yeah continue using reddit as metric to determine whether someone is sane or not the new stormfront home of the incels mgotw mixed with idiot ron paul libertarian supporters boston bombing detectives 4chan lovers and other scums of society no wonder you fit in well here philip zimbardo wrote in the lucifer effect that the people history often holds up as heroes are those that go against the crowd when they see something wrong like the soldier that reported the brutality at abu ghraib to many other through out historydont worry i seen many of your type in mental asylums often when their world view collapses and you cant handle reality no more
14	1	i used to like hnl because of its outdoor spaces and pleasant air  then i started flying more interisland  that hawaiian airlines checkin lobby is a total fucking disaster zone now reminiscent of a chinese train station circa 1995 just wall to wall packed with miserable people missing their flights because of interminable waits to get through the checkin stations and tsa lines which forces them to get into new service lines to try to rebook their tickets
15	1	kens fresh fish dont forget them
16	1	ive cooked a lot of spam on a beachflame i use tinfoil how else would you hotmarinade it with shoyu properly all that mahoganycolor will fall into the fire

24	1	are you packing heat right now  do you have it on you 247365  do you shop at a grocer with one go to a kids ball game with one
25	1	what are you talking about  the context of this thread is about physical disciplinary acts on your kids  not about strangers putting a hand on your child  if a stranger put a hand on my child someone is going to the hospital  my comment to you on that particular post was because you guys come here and leave post about what you did but than yet you let the person continue to beat his child  the way you describe your experience was if the adult was beating the shit out of the kid  if that was so why did you just call the cops  why dont you do something and get involved  instead you came here to post and rant  it makes no sense to me if the event arises in front of you and the event is so egregious do something to stop the offense  dont just come here and bitch and rant
26	1	john wick does it well enough in the documentary just do the tueller drill a few hundred times and work on the mozambique no problem

31	1	i said literally that in my post it was a response to you not mentioning them at all as if seminomads were the only people in the americas
32	1	so you think all the new fancy restaurants in chinatown are for all the chinese immigrants and locals that are there all day long
33	1	nah get used to it russia and trumper will do the same
34	1	you got enough there no reason you cant save up and buy a house in hawaii source my life
35	1	gtit is just a name but one name isnt inherently more significant than any other name it is a way to refer to a thing and it is the thing that is significant yes names carry meaning but the point is that the time and energy spent researching hawaiian culture to find a single word in a book that has nothing else to do with hawaiian culture except that generations and generations ago the engineer of the starship had a culture and backstory is a waste of time compared to you know the actual writing part hey man im actually hawaiian some friendly advice you seriously need to do some research and it is fine to correct mistakes names have a lot of mana or power in hawaii how you say it how you call someone who says your name can go several different ways go and research and youll come across not only several names for your story but very likely some characters and character motivation and the beginning of a plot too
36	1	there is daiso everywhere in the uae it is like the one bit of japanese culture in the small town im living in  too bad they dont sell arare and senbei too
37	1	sounds like you have no idea what the demographics of oahu are and am basing all your assumptions off a visit to the don quixote in town and you definitely havent gone to the one in pearl city
38	1	oh that is interesting maybe i should have tried my card then  i saw the covered terminal and just paid cash
39	1	what the fuck is wrong with people like i get setting shit off on a holiday but on a random tuesday night and fireworks arent cheapi always think about veterans with ptsd people with little babies or elderly or sick folks just trying to fuckin sleep who raised these idiots that theyre doing this crap
40	1	ahi amp vegetable spicy ahi bowl double scoop  with their mild dressing on toptastes like sexwhich is probably why i can finish it in 60 seconds
41	1	my parents got so excited after that happened because now they can say theyre bilingual
42	1	yeah i missed that thanks
43	1	lol i just think its hilarious cause that is how we grew up in hawaii the common thought years ago was when you stepped on a sea urchin wana you have to urinate on the sting to lessen the pain looking back on it this is such a crazy old wives tale this video plays on that and utilizes some of the funniest upcoming local comedians and popular surfers as back ups to momoa this is local culture if you can understand it
44	1	this is a good option thanks have you used vrbo before
45	1	dude is from here he is in smitz and some other bands too i think
46	1	ive heard terrible things about japan is summers unfortunately the school breaks are the only windows for travel summer break is the most doable because of the length  if i waited for spring or winter id pretty much be constrained to 1weekim glad to hear that the english language isnt too out of the norm there that eases my worries a bit  im assuming most signs in the city would be written in english ive entertained the bullet train if we decided to take the train the next big decision would be whether we buy one way tickets or 7 day pass multiply those amounts by 4 passengers and that is something to worry about  ive also thought about doing the split airport thing you mentioned just not sure if wed be forcing in too much commuting making the trip more of a stressful rush rather than a vacation  if it was just me and my wife i think the logistics wouldnt be a problem but adding the two kids although they are very capable of looking out for themselves into the mix makes it a little bit more difficultthese are the reasons why im leaning towards paying for a package seems like a lot more money upfront but would it somewhat equalize if i did do it by myself and have everything added up at the endbesides cost i think  maybe the only other drawback when opting for a guided package is free roaming aspect of traveling  i dont travel very much so what do i know
47	1	e komo mai to our islandsi would also like state funds to be used for education and transportationour disagreement probably comes from how i oppose the use of state funds and violence to infringe on the human right of being able to properly arm a citizen for reasons including self defense
48	1	that would set a precedent of whichever party has more money will get whatever they want by shutting down the government and starving out the other side is congresspeopledo you really want the richer party to make all the laws thatd likely mean the republicans today
49	1	cats like dogs get used as bait in dog fight training  domesticated cats that are trusting are stolen for this purpose
50	1	pretty insensitive thing to say any of us could be homeless at any point in hawaii just because someone doesnt have a home doesnt mean they deserve that kind of attitude toward them it is a public park they have the same right as you do to be there
51	1	that concert was money i loved every song
52	1	nah i just heard a woman on npr talking about how integral the stars were to her culture she is an astrologist and i liked what she had to say figured that in this make believe world it wasnt outside the realm of possibility that a hawaiian designed and named a star ship didnt realize how unrealistic youd think that was
53	1	brah you gotta dip um in brown sugar first change yo life cuz
54	1	agreed interesting about the dual citizenship i didnt know that lorin thurston was kicked out of wa dc eventually i would think you couldnt do that to a citizen
55	1	coarse
56	1	they are literally donating a 25 million dollar facility that will be used by all the keiki regardless of class of all the things to get mad about this is the wrong hill to die on ampx200bsure this is a ploy to gain good will on one thing or another no one is truly altruistic these days but come on this is a good thing im sure that the kids will be delighted to play there

62	1	well it is a bit too late for that now haha living in hawaii now maybe later ill be able to though and yeah every month we went on a couple hour drive to our aunt and cousins who live in waco and good god texas was just so grey everywhere the most interesting part was honestly the farm we passed that had a bunch of zebras in it lol
63	1	awesome thanks so much for the link
64	1	i think you mean wahiawa s
65	1	yeah those drone strikes were the bomb
66	1	smart made sure he doesnt kill anyone and he can get a solid accurate landing versus a high eject
67	1	and this is just a comment on reddit  either way symbolism has been and is immensely powerful and youre degrading a lot more beyond this by stating this simple act is not important that simple acts cant have a profound effect
68	1	how would they conceive of looking at and understanding the stars remind me again how they navigated
69	1	heres some of my favorite old school songs from hawaii blessings to you and your familykolea  everything that glitters isnt goldhttpsyoutubemmv0mdomitmmoke boy  grandpa and godhttpsyoutubeuiqfsxvprwokaau crater boys  ryhtm of the falling rainhttpsyoutubegakfufqhtve

74	1	nope try again
75	1	its really interesting the united states has been the biggest contributor to reduction in emissions in the past 2 years and the chinese have pledged to continue increasing their emissions until 2030 which sucks because china and india are the biggest polluters in the world right now
76	1	uh urban garden center had one recently
77	1	i work in the food industry in waikiki our fryer went down everyone was pissed i didnt realize mainland and international need their fries lmfao
78	1	my bad i didnt see this one only your last post showed the first one no i disagree heshe constructed an insult i refered to it as dumb the second yeah after looking back at it i didnt see it from that perspective and youre right
79	1	oh that is odd  i thought i checked it  thanks
80	1	appreciate it anything helps with getting the word out  happy holidays to you and yours
81	1	nah but ive seen a good amount of texas and illinois gonna assume that you see this kinda thing a lot in louisiana
82	1	who cares this isnt something we can stop and it is basically too late at this point the trump supporter yelling that is it is not really happening and the liberal yelling about how we need to stop eating beef and drive electric cars as if that is even going to have an impact at this time are both equally out of touch
83	1	could you pm me  i dont want to exchange a bunch of info  rather just meet up with you guys at a spot to fish that is publicsafe but ill be stoked to take a new couple out
84	1	that sell decent shoes

94	1	ah i didnt see that thank you
95	1	ive gone twice tokyoyokohoma in early december and osakakyotonara in may it really is a coin flip because both are very representative of japan tokyo is more inner city sight seeing with day trips for nature to nearby spots but you can travel less and see more by going from neighborhood to neighborhood osakakyoto is a little more spread out and has more natureoutdoor sight seeing but travel time is a little more spread out when we took our day trip from osaka to nara to see the deer and check out the temples and sights we rented bikes but we were drenched and absolutely out of energy by the early evening this was in may during the summer i suspect it would be killer to ride around nara in the heat same thing if you hiked up to the monkey park in arashiyama at the outer skirts of kyoto which i wouldnt say is a very difficult hike its just a lot of walking generally the trains get you to the area but youre walking the area once you are theremost buildings i would say have ac but again youll be doing a lot of traveling to and from places feel free to pm if you have other questions
96	1	sounds like youve picked a side in a contentious controversy regardless the idea that china would project its power thousands of miles away to hawaii is a completely contrived notion used to justify nation theft
97	1	unfortunately it was a shared dorm with 4 beds im very worried
98	1	thanks for the information my mom was in bay area recently and was super excited to go to indian markets to buy rose water so i will be sure to keep a lookout for potential xmas gifts
99	1	its typical in hawaii for for landlord to require guarantors to be hawaii residents so theres thatbut with good credit and a budget of 3kmonth you shouldnt need guarantors the pit bull thing will be much more difficult than the financial aspect of your situationalso dogs coming to hawaii have to either get all of their shots or else be quarantined for like 6 months or something so make sure you read the laws on that and have your shit together long before you plan to move so that they dont lock your dog up
100	1	they seem to be marinated but most of the flavor is definitely in the sauce underneath it
101	1	there is no place on the island i would feel unsafe  compared to the mainland this place has low crime
102	1	honestly that is what bugs me about these socalled traffic studies depending on the research methodology the data that is actually gathered how its interpreted who is actually funding the research and a myriad of other factors practically any city or state in the country could be found to have the worst traffic or worst drivers or worst road all i know for certain is that as a cyclist drivers freaking suck everywhere
103	1	someone is mad hahaha  whatever youre doing just keep doing you boo  from what i can tell you handle situations very well
104	1	then i must rebuttalhttptimecom3387226spankingcanbeanappropriateformofchilddisciplinehttptimecom3387226spankingcanbeanappropriateformofchilddisciplineampx200bhttpsgoodparentorgcorporalpunishmentresearchoncorporalpunishmentevidencefavoringtheuseofdisciplinaryspankinghttpsgoodparentorgcorporalpunishmentresearchoncorporalpunishmentevidencefavoringtheuseofdisciplinaryspankingampx200bhttpswwwhealthlinecomhealthparentingspankingprosandcons5httpswwwhealthlinecomhealthparentingspankingprosandcons5
105	1	im from michigan i have family in hawaii we visited a few years ago and this was one thing that blew my mind i picked up some from the 711 and split it with my brother and we thought it was great the creative uses of spam was great but the food that changed my life was the shaved ice with the coconut ice cream filling i left my heart on that island

115	1	airbnb requested the state to allow them to collect and send appropriate taxes which most owners also prefer  and the state said no  httpswwwusnewscomnewsbeststateshawaiiarticles20180119hawaiigovernorrejectsproposedtaxagreementwithairbnb
116	1	so instead you guys come in to a forum and post about how this and that happened but you guys didnt wanna get involved
117	1	seriously hnl is bathrooms are in some of the worst shape out there for bathrooms  even if they clean it the fixtures seem to be in disrepair the stall doors sometimes fail to close water pressure is all over the place and there just seems to be rarely maintainedi cant imagine hnl being that underfunded  it is the lifeblood of our tourism industry youd figure theyd at least make our bathrooms not look like a pigsty
118	1	a few years ago i flew into the hilo airport and it felt like they havent touched a thing in the place since the 80s  everything looks so drab and run down  i thought hnl was bad until i flew there  it is like they didnt upgrade or modernize anything there
119	1	and john mccain  born to americans in the military in panama

125	1	king kalakaua was also a fan of bringing modern technology to hawaii making us one of the early countries to adopt electricityhttpsspectrumieeeorgtechhistorydawnofelectronicsedisonandthekinghowhawaiibecameelectrified in his letters he expressed interest in astronomyhttpswwwifahawaiieduuserssteigerhistorypdf and having telescopes on our mountains im not saying this isnt a complicated issue and that the us didnt royally screw up with how they treated the native population banning the hawaiian language was terrible and the economic consequences of colonialism still haunt us todaythat said it irks me seeing a small group of people claiming to speak for hawaii when even most people who identify as native hawaiians say they support the telescopeshttpwwwwesthawaiitodaycom20180326hawaiinewspollshowsstrongpublicsupportforthirtymetertelescopegtthe poll found that support has especially grown among hawaii natives about 72 percent of native respondents supported the telescope in the latest poll two years ago the native approval was only 39 percentive been smeared for saying stuff like this in the past even after defending the hawaiian studies community at uh and their point of view  with my emails defending them to other scientists being leaked by the anti tmt folks to be mocked on twitter but i dont care i think having a dialogue is important i also think the telescopes stand to give something back and that it is cool they make us famous for something that is not tourism related tmt will also give 1 million a yearhttpswwwtmtorgpagethinkfund to local outreach and education and theyve been giving this money to the community even as the construction has remained blocked i dont think we can say the same for hilton marriott big developers in kakaako etc there is also a large fund appropriated to decommission old telescopes and ensure the mountain is kept in good shape with extensive environmental impact studies having been conducted

142	1	100 about being lazy i googled spent a day reading myths figured id ask people who knew more than me  ampx200b
143	1	yea if i was educated on this i wouldnt need to ask anyone else for advice   as far as cultural appropriation is concerned sure i could just call the ship maui mk ii and be done with it and that would be cultural appropriation because it has 0 respect for the culture it originates from and the reference doesnt even make much sense  but being ignorant isnt the same as being disrespectful and i am the first to admit how little i know about hawaiian folklore  ampx200b
144	1	no picture taking pictures with all those people around only attracts more attention to the seal
145	1	probably a mental disability
146	1	well it is a joke  going all the way from pupukea to haleiwa or kahuku is going to take a long time on foot  but it often feels like you could get there faster walking  a bike would be faster for real if you werent likely to die by the end of a summer
147	1	thiskatherine is very intelligent and she had her bases covered i still believe they will all get off this is far too much corruption and it is just too deeply rooted we probably wouldnt have any upper level leadership left if everyone was outed

152	1	you did mention the military and homeland security though both of which the uscg falls under that is the only reason i included it
153	1	maybe i can clarify a bit i study physics but ive always been fascinated by astronomy so ive followed these discoveries for many years including eagerly anticipating new horizons for wayyy too many yearslong story short they decided pluto isnt a planet and these new large objects arent planets because they are part of a huge sparsely populated asteroid belt called the kuiper belthttpssolarsystemnasagovsolarsystemkuiperbeltoverview on the outskirts of our solar system we changed our definitions because we initially didnt know this existed we just didnt have the technology to see these dim faraway objects even though they orbit our own sun but we could see pluto because it was one of the biggest and closest of them and had its own little moonthere is also another cloud a little bit beyond that called the oort cloudhttpssolarsystemnasagovsolarsystemoortcloudoverview these clouds look large and dense in these images but the objects inside are actually few and far between space is mostly empty after all as a result we cant see such clouds around other solar systems but we have good reasons to believe theyre there they are essentially the left over dust from the solar system is formation left in orbits where there wasnt enough stuff to gather into a whole planet
154	1	yea they got big snails sometimes the snails get in the water
155	1	could be if she goes down so do i if she is been committing crimes in her job then kind of hard to believe hed be totally clean of it

162	1	hawaiians came primarily from the marquesas hawaiian is more closely related to marquesan than tahitian if there was a tahitian migration here it was as a slightly later arrival of a ruling class new zealand was likewise colonized from the marquesas andor tahiti around the same time as hawaii was probably both were after rapa nui since both maori and hawaiians had sweet potatoes micronesians played no role whatsoever in peopling polynesia they are from a completely separate migration from the western pacificdo you ever get tired of being wrong
163	1	sorry i didnt clarify  i was living abroad until just very recently
164	1	but more importantly it is where they learn respect something sorely lacking with these line cutters
165	1	i know i need to do research but i dont have any idea of where to begin thankfully there are a few helpful people here among the weeds so i have a better idea now unfortunately in my day of poking around i just got more confused by online resources that didnt seem terribly credible to me so i figured id ask where someone who might know and care could point me in the right direction of course nobody is obligated to help but similarly nobody is obliged to be an ass either   without knowing where to start the simplest solution is to abandon the idea but despite what some people seem to be assuming i feel like abandoning an idea just because it is hard because im not familiar with it is why we get so little diversity in scifi and fantasy though it is getting a little better idk how comfortable id be taking too much inspiration that isnt mine though recognizing other cultures i dont feel like runs too much risk of appropriation
166	1	what is going on
167	1	thanks
168	1	you got a lot wrong starting with your obnoxious attitude yes we live in a society great observation are the people from the mainland clinging to their culture by bringing mcdonalds here or crossfit should demand not dictate business decisions or only if you embrace the local culture regardless of where youre from because youre here now  you reek of racism regardless of whether or not youre aware you obviously do not care for the local culture either based on your complete lack of aloha
169	1	username checks out

175	1	perhaps you however dont need to research a thesis to know that hawaii was and is a sovereign nation as recognized by the rest of the world you are taking a side in a much murkier debate that doesnt even involve your country how about you and the other bleeding hearts attend to the nation that has been colonized with your dollars under threat of violence from your military since 1893
176	1	yah i saw those wish i took some with me when hiking wait im being downvoted
177	1	i would say that missing a paycheck is much worse than getting that time off especially if youre considered essential then you work for free until they retroactively pay you so its pretty terrible
178	1	mexico is also the united states  united mexican statesi used to have friends from bolivia who would make sure that people knew they were american  bolivia being in south america of coursehowever when speaking of a country the us of america is the only one to use the name america
179	1	thank you
180	1	the 2nd photo op posted is from the breakwall closer to the natatorium that doesnt exist in the 1952 photo
181	1	and it sucks that you are on the side because you actually are giving leeway to these racist dumbasses that should even have a seat to the children is tableand yes i got multiple death threats in the end gamergate white supremacists and berniebro death threatens all sound the same
182	1	its time for common sense baseball bat control
183	1	yeah pedestrian too when i visited japan i was amazed at how safe i felt walking around and how many bicyclists there were night and day difference from hawaii
184	1	no we understand what it take to discipline a child
185	1	thats very helpful thank you would you happen to know where we can find tents  sleeping bag as well i saw there was a general store not sure if they sell those
186	1	oh chinatown then
187	1	why not locals
188	1	tibet is better off in china
189	1	what is the pcc i was planning on doing polynesia for a whole day snorkeling and maona in one day and diamond head and horseback on another day do you think thats doable
190	1	the proper comparison isnt before and after settlers arrived but recognized indian tribes versus tribes that arent recognized  the latter are even worse off no land no selfgovernment
191	1	the sushi handrolls and pork hash are pretty damn good too imoampx200bbeen cutting back on meat lately so the new tofu musubi has been my go to
192	1	i found it weird that every major international city ive ever been to has a daiso uniqlo muji hampm and gap within walking distance of each other  almost depressing if it werent so damn convenient
193	1	paper taper here 3feedline5
194	1	i recognized your username and saw that you posted this in our visitors subhttpswwwredditcomrhawaiivisitorscommentsa1qmhcoahu_kauai_how_long_to_stay_on_each_to_get_full so ten days or less of vacation will not be able to give you a good grasp of what living out here is actually likeyoull have a great time youll see things youve never seen before and youll want to come back just please remind yourself that you only vacationed here
195	1	thank you for the information very interesting and thank you for the clarification
196	1	ummm they called the cops  did you miss that part  no you read it per your last comment

199	1	ditto ahi assassins for honolulu
200	1	i dont know  i reckin im gonna ride my combine out to the back 40 and harvest me some nice ripe rain now that the season is here
201	1	mainlander here at least where i live spam gets a pretty bad rap and no one eats it
202	1	now that is funny
203	1	amen on that mexican food ever since luibuenos relocated its been real hard to find really good mexican food el ranchero in wahiawa has good tamales but its just not the same
204	1	dude shut up and stop politicizing everything  if they wanted to do this to satisfy the affluent community they wouldve put it in kahala  theyre putting it in ala moana because it is centralized
205	1	every person with a patch that is been chaptered or otherwise has claimed ptsd as the reason for their misgivings every meb has had some version of ptsd claimed ptsd is real everyone in uniform having it is not
206	1	it is the under the skull stuff thats the issue this is the kind of event that changes who you are and how capable you are as a person
207	1	serioiusly unewtongimmick isnt on the side with regards to tulsi is shittiness  i cant stand gabbard either or low information progressives that think progessivism begins and ends with bernie but youre really not helping the cause
208	1	the romans didnt control the routes to china or even travel all the way they traded with people along them  the people who had the most expansive control of them were turkic  the silk road trade routes were absolutely not roman  have you ever heard of marco polo  he was over 1000 years after the fall of rome
209	1	the environment has nothing to do with it many of the healthiest states have harsh winters i think health primarily has to do with drug and alcohol abuse which tends to affect certain ethnic groups harder pacific islander communities in hawaii struggle with drug and alcohol abuse and it shows in their low life expectancy
210	1	at least a hot dog you can situate it lengthwise with the grates and get it crisp almost all the way around i think fried is preferred so you can sear the whole surface
211	1	i agree i just moved to hawaii from the southeast where i lived my whole life one of the first things i noticed about hawaii was how much more courteous the people are than what i was accustomed to back home both in general and on the roads imo hawaiian drivers are wayyy better than those in any of the southeastern states particularly the bigger cities
212	1	well thanks for the concern i have had birds in the past years ago but still i have had a good bit of experience ive done all my research and i have the required equipment i was just worried about how to leave the islands with one cause i wouldnt wanna spend 200 on a bird and then have to leave it and before you question the whole flying thing i have flown with birds successfully before
213	1	yeah why boddah you
214	1	lol
215	1	i spent the day reading various things i found through the internet but it is kind of a massive subject area and as interesting as i find them i kinda wanted to write not spend a bunch of time reading for what ultimately is just the name of a place
216	1	you all make me feel so young with my rpgile experience and tape backups
217	1	why would i bother reading any other comment of yours when you did such a shitty job of explaining that in the first comment its literally why were having this interaction
218	1	we have them in australia theyre awesome and they definitely have christmas decorations etc they even have trees
219	1	thank you for your well thought out and logical response if only more people used their minds productively
220	1	yeah gotcha it was just written like it was an exhaustive list but if places with both are on it than safeway should be there etc
221	1	well then im only halfmayo thank you very much
222	1	we need to invent chicken spam then rectangles are the only way
223	1	carport parties are the best
224	1	wow i didnt even realize it was a whole other fruit my dad called starfruit star apple when i was a kid and i always wondered where he got that term from ive never eaten a real star apple though and idk where he got the name though
225	1	with all of his rapist wit
226	1	lol good one
227	1	it is a partial government shutdown a lot of agencies were already fundedalso for the congresscritters that arent wealthy say like soontobe congresscritter alexandria ocasiocortez would you want them to take any crap deal to restart the government so they could put food on the table
228	1	really no deodorant  and here i was worrying about the weird toilets that i may encounter hah hah   i dont think the kids would be ready for any deep country stuff they barely enjoy diamond head crater hah hah   when i say japanjapan i mean to say iconic landmarks of old japan   like the shinto shrine gates in kyoto maybe a bamboo forest pagodas  that kinda stuff as opposed to city lights and large billboard advertisements on buildings  at this point i really dont know what main things the family want to see but from what i can pry out of the kids theyre giving me the impression that the byodoin temple in kaneohe would satisfy hah hahh
229	1	thanks
230	1	no that is a very appropriate stance to take  the tsa is both ineffective and actually causes more deaths and at this point its existence is political  there are other ways to be nice to kids than to use this hearts and minds approach on domestic youtheither way they didnt tell the tsa guy to foff they didnt make a scene  they were probably polite and realized any push back would further complicate the matter to their child  and that only makes it worse because there is no best way to tell the tsa guy dont do that so it is forced upon this family  bitching about it later is the light way to handle it
231	1	at my house in orchidland you can only get decent cell signal on the second story which most houses dont have  there is no cable no dsl and they only just started bringing fiber optic line in january mifi is slow for a video link usually 35 mbps
232	1	the blue hawaii podcast
233	1	i agree
234	1	i think youll find hawaii residents dont like that joke very much
235	1	im not wrong
236	1	holy fuck you just blew my goddamn mind i thought i had to be way richer to travel when you just google flights to japan everything is 800 this might be the first time  a reddit comment actually changed my life
237	1	we use 95 ethanol but you can use anything above 50 ethanol or isopropyl will work fine even cheap vodka the higher the percentage the quicker the kill if suffering of the little guys matters to you
238	1	while that is true i doubt that a poke place in virginia is serving fresh never frozen ahi im sure some places may i have had decent sushi in a landlocked state however i paid quite a bit more then a casual dining place would usually charge most of the poke i have had outside of hawaii has been previously frozen
239	1	umeke is hands down the best
240	1	especially the rainless windless nyes when the smoke just sat there building up to the point where you couldnt see across the road
241	1	ahi assassin is fresh catch tamuras are my go to they always have a fresh option and cut their own fish every day most super markets have fresh as well and need to disclose when it is previously frozen it is more expensive to get fresh but tastes much better and totally different texture to previously frozen  fish it melts in your mouth vs chewy have ever bought poke in hawaiibefore
242	1	i suspect kauai doesnt have a problem with water supply
243	1	you called the cops and didnt stick around to give a statement and point out which kid dumbass
244	1	ah yea i saw the updated report and it seems like itll happen sooner than previously projected sea level rise isnt evenly distributed though and fortunately rates at hawaii is a little slower in any case looks like 3 feet by the end of the century although theres a great deal of uncertainty in the models so we dont really know if itll be worse or not as bad it depends on where youre investing buy the high ground lol
245	1	including reddit in this very post
246	1	thanks for the advice and offer ive already done so much to my 4r and it is exactly what i wantminus the tranny cant imagine ill find another like it
247	1	actually typically doctors get paid more in the rural areas for most specialties at least on the national scale  higher pay is needed to attract doctors otherwise theyd want to live in the exciting cities like everyone else but yes living near city near major hospital and resources makes life easier for doctors and patients too
248	1	do a dollop of unewtongimmick
249	1	gti also love how the shills are downvoting all antitulsi comments already that was quick they must be working overtime this holiday season gotta make that christmas money what there is almost no positive comments about her and the negative ones are highly upvoted
250	1	so op is criticizing hawaii state for letting rampant growth naturally erode an unnatural artificial beach back to the natural condition
251	1	agreed ive coldsmoked it like a cheese and then hotmarinade it with tare like normal
252	1	it is a salad on the mainland
253	1	if hawaii becomes a long term thing hilo is definitely where id like to go but ill need to spend at least two years in honolulu probably seven if everything goes well since the lab that id be joining that makes hi so perfect is at manoa honolulu is okay but if i were able to pick where i was moving it wouldnt be at the top of my list
254	1	some people just suck
255	1	the small guy with a big heart attitude
256	1	if you shot this guy with a ccw you would probably go to jail in hawaii even if he was swinging a bat
257	1	you werent supposed to actually name the secret just lead them in the right direction
258	1	i wouldnt go as far as saying theyre specifically designed for swimming theyre definitely designed to active people but more like running and waking than swimming theyre water resistant not water proof
259	1	native hawaiians are not currently treated like first class citizens extremely over represented in all stats you dont want to be incarceration homeless alcoholism domestic abuse poverty etc the list is longsovereignty is not a step back it is the only way forward it only took this  place 200 years  and westerners to go from 100 sustainable to importing 95 of all goods and services off the backs of first nation people is who have cared for this place for hundreds of years
260	1	physical violence  beating  not about discipline  ok your reading comprehension is on point  good job
261	1	ccw is martial arts
262	1	its worked twice for me once for a comedy show and once for a football game i always have a plan b karaoke watching football from a sports bar outside the stadium going to dinner at a fancy place etc in case its still higher than im willing to pay
263	1	and tacomas
264	1	i agree there are certain indicators which let you know youre in a sketchy area  be aware i was born amp raised here but there are certain areas i would never take my children
265	1	i ended up watching from my yard because i wasnt too sure about going out somewhere new by myself at night  even with the light pollution i saw some
266	1	eh what they gonna do go door to door and ask if anyone doing anything illegal
267	1	oahu isnt overpopulated it is overinvested tons of properties especially condos are simply bought and kept empty by rich foreign and mainland buyers
268	1	ruined i want one of everything in one sitting the pictures should be illegal as everything looks good i cant find something there i dont want to try it is like a song stuck in my head i need to get there this weekend im sure i will appreciate the link once i eat there but now i got an itch i cant scratch
269	1	the fish is like what4050 from boat to bowl
270	1	where would you go
271	1	nope been trying to activate it since nov 15finally got an email response and they just said to request a new activation email which ive been doing ever since i made an accountive already received the holo card at least a week ago but cant use it
272	1	if still no can talk to unko kekoa  he hook you up
273	1	it is open
274	1	nah they dont cut it to be a perfect fit
275	1	i see why this guy got downvoted to oblivion but it isnt a terrible conversation topicthe olulu or hawaiian cabbage on a stick is probably extinct in the wild but proliferates because it was commercially offered as an ornamental at plant nurseries
276	1	no clue about industries but i was just thinking more along the lines of taxation and stuff
277	1	whats with the downvotes this is pretty funny
278	1	ho bah like buy one yota my cousin get one eighty treeeee steek shiff twennytwo ahhh moto get lockahz fuckah is hammah get russ but she still solid we bangem out yokes al da time he stay askin 8 gran onlylmfao baddahs and their toyotas the fuckin things cost so damn much cause idiots actually buy them for that much how the fuck one 80s toyota truck cost more than they bluebook for
279	1	it is no different than going to a chiefs game and seeing people with tomahawks  maori at least had the same roots thousands of years ago  but the players probably dont think of themselves as maori anymore than the chiefs think theyre chiefs  and neither is hawaiian
280	1	it is a little weird right im not hawaiian or maori but i saw the news of this and kind of went huh dude is hawaiian by ancestry and birth though as you noted he was raised in iowa so it is natural that hed want to embrace his pacific islander heritage  though hawaiian and maori cultures are vastly different despite sharing common lineage he probably just thinks the haka is super cool
281	1	get a lifecomplaining this much about a kid being given a sticker is fucking pathetic
282	1	and ive been using sous vide all these years
283	1	this is true for species like the endangered finless porpoise but there arent any breeding programs for bottlenose dolphins or orcas designed to bring back wild populations captive bred dolphins and whales typically cant be released into the wild because they most likely wouldnt be able to survive captive cetacean breeding programs at marine parks are put in place to have more captive cetaceans to profit from now that wild captures are usually not granted in places like the us and drive fisheries that acquire animals in places like japan are deemed controversial
284	1	youve got a lot of anger in you
285	1	that is the thing it already was pretty obvious that there had been some impropriety by kealoha  from what had been made public at the time then he went on tv and vouched for her  it sounds like from this article what he is being investigated for is his actions around that time there was already a very slim chance that this was just going to blow over she was already being probed by the fbi and had her dirty laundry coming out so why would he put himself in legal jeopardy
286	1	do you agree that people should not be allowed to take their dogs to the park
287	1	what the back road or the normal road i dont even get why people say the normal road is hard to drive it is beautiful and winding
288	1	yeppers on kam hwy from mililani to wahiawa cop pulls me over and tells me to get off the road im pretty certain im well within my rights to be on the road should i even bother filing a complaint i doubt itll change anything
289	1	the last one i gave because i wanted you to know that i understand physical discipline can have negative affects to a child i believe my views have a flip side it doesnt scare me that not all techniques work the way you would and it to go just as believing that a non physical discipline technique could also have a negative outcome as well
290	1	thx for detailed info poor hawaii
291	1	you dont know shit youre just parroting stop spouting
292	1	thanks that sounds like a good way to go about it
293	1	better bring it
294	1	lol  totally should have done that since i was drinking hot green tea and an iced mocha
295	1	to you too brah
296	1	we need more jobsunemployment is too highbuys robots
297	1	no the land can not be made as it was before   do you know how many vehicles travel on the road to the telescopes daily   1215 hundred every day  with at least one human or a van full   where does all the human waste go   what about that amount of vehicles traveling through hawaiian home lands no means no   i do not care if you understand their concerns or not  you wrote no is a poor negotiating strategy  they did not attend hearings    then get your ass to these folks  ask why and then listen to their concerns   their perception is valid for them   returning the land to as it was before really   it looks like mountain top removal up there    the damage to the mountain is done  removing 6 telescopes or decommissioned as you say  is a bullshit compromise   i am in no position to articulate their concerns  however i have spent time going to them and listening to people in this grass roots movement  reading what you wrote makes their case clear   returning the land to as it was before  you are high on something   you have strategies to get what you want  it is not for sale   it was stolen  abused  the disrespect  are you channeling the elders   they would be down with this   they told you   your assumption could be wrong  what if they did not attend the hearings because those hearings were placating  pointless   democracy in action  you would be surprised to know i am pro science  pro space exploration  all for astronomy   i am also for humanity    honor and respect for those protecting our mountain    i would like to write please go fuck yourself  that is too easy  please go and ask questions  go to these folks and listen   not for ten minutes  listening to talk story in hawaii takes time   give yourself a lot of time to fully listen to people who have concerns about this  do not go to debate   if you listen you may in fact learn things you can not comprehend at this time   i wish returning the land to as it was before was laughable  it is not  it is heartbreaking
298	1	ill probably go that route a family friend can get it shipped to his company is warehouse for under 400 probably worth it but i dont have to decide today thanks again
299	1	ive also traveled the world far and wide and i would never ever put uae dubai in a positive light against the usa easily one of the worst countries ive ever visited regarding china your view about them seems shortsighted to me they have much to be ashamed of right now eg all the air water pollution killing their citizens
300	1	ok well your meme says guaranteed delivery which means something else im pretty sure they stated the same thing last year but didnt live up to it
301	1	no afaik there are mostly small independent dollar stores that fill this niche
302	1	because most congressmen are already millionaires it ensures the wealthy ones cant hold the lack of pay over the reps who need it in order to pressure them to vote in a specific way actually a pretty smart system to prevent blackmail
303	1	it doesnt prevent shipping scooters it creates a situation where internet retail will have separate infrastructure for shipping from china and to hawaii which is why it doesnt happen very often
304	1	one that perhaps can hook a sista up i havent been sleeping very well
305	1	we need this in canada
306	1	there are several state airports in mexico that are much nicer than hnl hnl is a joke but so are hilo maui amp kauai airports
307	1	some people can be forced to sell but only if the majority of other owners want to  otherwise you could have a 1128th holdout preventing someone who owns the other 127128ths from selling their share for a useful price because no one wants to buy a plot of land when there is a random person out there who can veto anything you want to do with it
308	1	of course lolonly one state employee knew how to access the time capsule
309	1	thank you and if heshe does then i will always remind them where they got it from
310	1	we really arent our housing crisis is because of our misuse of land not due to overpopulation
311	1	it is called respect and you dont have any
312	1	good findso yes there has been erosion but not nearly as much as i had expectedhttpsiimgurcommpreh4jpng  the op photos are clearly not taken from the same spot as the breakwater partial in the old photo is visible in both overheads
313	1	how hawaii became a territory violence illegality very much matters thats like saying that selling a stolen car doesnt matter as long as bill of sale gets written land title is void theres a lein  war crimes if you want to be an american go live in america if you arent a hawaiian national you are a war criminal for via occupation and you will be held accountable
314	1	no but next time i am in town i will ceartainly stop by thank you
315	1	well suggestions outside of beach and look at shit would help lol anything to do here
316	1	or he turns out to be alison lee wong
317	1	how long have you been doin it
318	1	thanks for the share
319	1	i understand where youre coming from but those captive animals wouldnt survive one day in the wild they never learned how to hunt properly or avoid predators unfortunately theres no perfect solution to the problem they shouldve never been in captivity in the first place
320	1	he is just letting you know he wont be running for any office
321	1	i just call them that because they wave hellohope that wasnt culturally insensitive
322	1	i thought the same
323	1	in the uae theyre the goto place for christmas decorations we got our tree there
324	1	it is an immutable peer to peer currency without a central authority that can never be inflated by government confiscated like gold was in 1933 magically disappear like when banks closed their doors and said sorry your money is gone can be sent overseas for close to nothing and acts like digital cash that is just bitcoinother crypto currencies like ethereum have a coding language built within them smart contracts can be programmed into the currency itself so that they can be fully automated to execute actions if conditions are met the only limit is human imaginationothers expand upon the immutability of the blockchain and can be used for manipulation free vote tallying tracking supply chains from factory to consumer to ensure authenticity the list is endless having real world use cases give currency innate value similar to precious metals where fiat is based only on faith
325	1	we dont want ndn money we want our country back
326	1	big kahuna pizza begs to differ with you also lahaina pizza companyi generally agree with your logic but pizza isnt that hard to do right and there are a couple noteworthy exceptions to hawaii is bad pizza rap
327	1	this may surprise youbut non japanese people may also like japanese dollar stores in the same way the japanese people may also like non japanese things
328	1	thanks
329	1	as an outsider can you please explain what you mean by this thanks
330	1	i figure that is what it is i just making fun
331	1	dude wtf
332	1	me too seeya at the gym let is go
333	1	idk shit i guess im still amazed you can fly this cheaply i have already bought a ticket to japan for next october
334	1	username checks out
335	1	they were right side of the stage about 20 rows up great sound quality they werent tiny but in a stadium its tough to get close without being on the floor im not a big fan of the floor seats so i actually prefer being in the bottom rows of stadium seating the video screens helped but werent necessary its not like the eagles move around much or do any crazy dances i was just there for the sounds
336	1	well see america looks to be on the precipice of rapid decline once the casuals go home and its just those of us with actual ties to the land remain things will look differently i doubt you are privy to the conversations that i participate in
337	1	does hawaii even have any grain silos hawaii imports 95 of its food which could certainly grow itsself and then expects there to never be disruptions that could lead to faminei am trying to figure out where to move to live and have a homesteadpanama is attractive as it doesnt have property taxes for small plots and actually grows some of its foodhttpwwwhawaiinewsnowcomstory29358547homelessonhawaiiislandpopulationhasmorethandoubledintwoyearsthis stupid banking system that prevents these people from growing their own food and subsistingthey only want a count so they can control the people more put them in facilities where they have to be in at night so the officials can pretend they dont exist et ceterasome of the plots i was looking at were quite wooded above mountain view would this cause problems in growing things i remember when i was in that area before there was very little soil mostly volcanic rocks
338	1	hilarious lol
339	1	hanlon is razor
340	1	that might be the case sometimes but this seems appropriatethe father is talking about the virtues of beating your kids because of football while the video is edited with cheerful music and references to family values i doubt ukuleles were getting strummed while this guy smacked his kid with a belt
341	1	no but do you think that they shouldnt have nice restaurants there because chinese immigrants and locals live there
342	1	montana has some towns full of rich people with nice houses that skew the results since their are so few houses
343	1	sopeople being unhappy that someone who had made homophobic comments yes several years ago was going to be the host of basically gayfest 2018 is equivalent to a company notorious for their coddling of racists nazis russian disinfo and other crap ignoring one of the millions of its racist accounts  it took something like two years after i reported it for fb to take down the page jewish ritual murder just for reference
344	1	this was my very first thought
345	1	hmm when i lived in tokyo i never saw this but what i did see with my own eyes was an older male fussing at a younger male for not offering his seat the older male repeated a few times in japanese are you ashamed but the younger guy just put on his headphones and ignored the older man the older man then just quietly stared at him the entire ride japan is probably slowly changing just like most other places shrug i will say for the mainland chinese though they have the largest population on earth cutting in line is absolutely nothing for them they are a very hardy people and believe in being assertive the government is trying to change the negative image of mainland chinese tourists though it didnt bother me that much in beijing
346	1	i think a lot has to do with our japanese population  when i returned to the east coast from a 3 month trip to japan i was astounded by how much obesity there was at the airport  it was really shockingalso i lived in pittsburgh for 3 years and as much as i like jogging and being outside doing healthy stuff the winters eventually had me in the pub drinking with everyone elsewe are so freaking lucky to live here
347	1	k
348	1	i feel like you dont actually know anything you just showed up to be loudly unrepentantly ignorant which like i get it when youre stupid i imagine it is really tempting to go around telling other people how dumb they are  of course if you do have any idea what youre talking about im all ears
349	1	ive never tried but ill take youre word mele kalikimaka
350	1	holy shit and all i had to do was use my brain
351	1	ive been there a few times and there is a great japanese grocery store on the top floor of the tokyu department store at mbk center i remember last time they had this really hot wasabi arare that was amazeballs gotta go to mos burger at siam paragon up the street for my teri burger fix too
352	1	or perhaps youre just an idiot not worth responding to lol research it yourself
353	1	it is not as bad on oahu the problem is the rural islands not having doctors and needing to be flown over to oahu for care
354	1	otoh the mitsubishi pajero did get renamed to montero in most of the americas spain and the philippines as the nane literally means wanker in spanish
355	1	jellyfish stuck to his face
356	1	i didnt see them thanks tho
357	1	marathon actually
358	1	it is only a legality issue on oahu where short term rentals are impossible to permit due to the hotels writing the laws and paying the politicians  there are other counties where airbnb is perfectly legal  in addition airbnb collecting and submitting taxes automatically makes it easier for the state to know who is operating and where while getting tax dollars for enforcement
359	1	in oakland stomach grumbles
360	1	ha all in good fun
361	1	i read somewhere that the guy playing his father in the movie is maori and that is probably why he did it  he learned it from temuera morrison
362	1	i thought dc is height restrictions was just because they dont want buildings higher than the washington monument
363	1	no gabbard is worst than clinton she is piece of shit sucking off assad and his mass killing wayshttpswwwtheatlanticcompoliticsarchive201701tulsigabbardsyria508367  also a white supremacists apologisthttpmauitimecomnewspoliticswhydidntreptulsigabbardjoin169ofhercolleaguesindenouncingtrumpappointeestephenbannon so fuck her she only took a stand when it popular to hate him
364	1	thanks i will sorry again
365	1	with the loss of all but three of her crew members
366	1	that sounds terrifying  the person im going with lives in something called pieeuhh and he calls it north shore he mentioned the giant waves so i think it is around the place you mentioned i guess ill just stay on the sand thanks
367	1	this happened years ago right
368	1	five guys is good that way because you can go with friends and one order of fries is totally enough for several people they just dump fries in the bag with the rest of the food it is madness
369	1	youre not wrong some bomb deals and no hoa dues on some homes easy 300 in savings
370	1	interesting
371	1	nice have you guys been doing it on a bigger scaleampx200b
372	1	okay that makes sense since im so close to ala moana beach park
373	1	funny
374	1	also pretty sure that he is a convert not raised in it  converts to any ideology religion politics etc are always the worst  the most zealous the most radical with the least understanding of the basic principles
375	1	i understand where you are coming from but my friend would like to be able to actually communicate with the artist on something as personal as a tattoo
376	1	i didnt ask any question i made a request for help do you understand the difference  jelloisalive at least gave me a place to start looking that is helpful  you did not  difference a little clearer now
377	1	upvote for hibachi the spicy thai poke gets me every time
378	1	eating with the opposite sex is kapu but im pretty sure you do it
379	1	honest question why dont you buy a place
380	1	haha youre right about the rice at ahi assassins the smoked marlin dip is hamma time tho
381	1	i feel bad for anyone that lives life like you do
382	1	thats the scary part
383	1	delta and american basic economy include carryon still but united does not american tried no carryon and reversed this in sept delta and american allow online checkin for the basic economy but united will not if you dont add a checked bag
384	1	gt false sense of securityim sure thats not the case when a majority of people in the state and nation havent had anything violent happen to themgt irresponsible to think thatits also irresponsible to tell everyone oh no the sky is falling and the world as we know it is all ending so we all need guns
385	1	how so
386	1	the ticket is for the field in front of the stageshould have cleared that up i guess lol
387	1	i think i may have started something cuz now my friends are all asking me eh how you got dat and when i tell them they charged me around 15 for it theyre like oh not bad hm so there may be an uptick of people walking out bww with big bags of ranch
388	1	i agree with you  fckhttpsfck these people here talking as if theyre better than us  if i felt i was abused i wouldnt love my parents  i understand as an adult that parents do things sometimes not because they hate you but because they want you to be a better person  they want you to understand that things are wrong  people here think that all kids have the capability to understand at a young age of why you dont do certain things  some kids just cant fathom it  only when you get wiser and understand the experiences  discipline and abuse is two different things
389	1	mondays only mb
390	1	youre talking about the polynesian cultural center yeah it is pretty far away but if youre interested in polynesian culture not only hawaii but all of polynesia i recommend you check it out also the drive out there is cool and more country than downtown honolulu
391	1	ima go there
392	1	that is different though and massage therapists are not going to cuddle with you also i thought the standard rate for an hr massage was 60 i guess prices have gone up again
393	1	the kauai and niihau dialects use the t sound instead of k similar to several other polynesian languages when missionaries created the written form of hawaiian they decided that since k and t were interchangeable between the different dialects they eliminated the t to create a smaller alphabet that would be easier to teach  the same is so with the letters bp and wvit is important to note that hawaiian as we know it isnt the traditional dialect for the islands as a whole it is the traditional dialect for hawaii islandinterestingly enough kamehameha ii signed his name as tamehameha whereas kamehameha iii signed as kamehameha suggesting that early written hawaiian favored the t but switched to the k to be more inline with big island dialect from which the ruling class was from
394	1	1 i didnt know all this jeez on another note though this honestly makes me think about the isolated sentinelese i dont know how many are there but i cant help but wonder if abuse is rampant eg sambia tribe in papua new guinea pitcairn etc
395	1	always
396	1	im not sure why youve gotten so many downvotes but hnl is pretty shoddy for a major international airport
397	1	well youre partially correct1  the kanaka maoli flag is not a rastafarian flag just cause it shares same colors doesnt mean it is my shit is brown still doesnt make it chocolate2  the kanaka maoli flag is not the original flag nor does it even have any ties or existence to the old days of the hawaiian kingdom it was just a flag that was designed and got popular the rumors came along with it and believe it or not till this day people still debate heavily that it is the original flag yet we can find no real history on it that flag popped up in the early 2000s before then zero people or history books has shown or spoken of this flagim a hawaiian blood native born and raised grew up hawaiian way and even im ashamed that theres natives that are dumb as fuck hawaiians love the bandwagon anything that gets some popularity they all want in on it so a design is made made into a flag bunch of people fly it then everyone and their mama jumps on itand id bet its colors had much to do with it leave it up to stoners anything with red yellow green will be their thing and as we know hawaii has many stoners bet if that flag was designed purple and white most wouldnt have given it a second glance
398	1	what needs to be realized in hawaii is all these mainland haole ideas of exporting vegetation and cattle out of hawaii doesnt work rather than exporting the attention and focus should be farming and a limited amount of cattle for local consumption hawaii could be selfsufficient in many areas if the state made that a priority versus keeping tourists happy and catering to offshore investment exploitation
399	1	was this a dumb and dumber reference
400	1	nope only in my dreams several times planning an april visit
401	1	there arent any dolphins or whales at sea life park that were brought into captivity for rehabilitation
402	1	sorry not yet httpwwwhawaiinewsnowcom20181222despiteclearvideoincidentsuspectbaseballrampagestilllarge
403	1	yep bacteria and a parasite toxoplasma gondii spread in cat feces would be real concerns infection with this parasite can cause toxoplasmosis which may result in miscarriages blindness or death it is also associated with several neurodegenerative diseases eg schizophrenia
404	1	pretty much yeah
405	1	30 yo single unfulfilled boomer
406	1	and that is the difference between me and you  you think physical discipline is out of anger its not  you think physical discipline is beating up its not  thats why you would never understand us  you come to hawaii thinking everyone should think like you and if we dont were mentally retardedyour words  i write these replies knowing you wont understand me  youre the same haole that came to hawaii and dethroned my queen  youre the same haole who came and took our lands  youre the same haole that came and told my people not to speak hawaiian  its the same mentality no matter how you want to spin it
407	1	preach my braddah
408	1	honest question  are you seeing a therapist if not please please look into it not a jab at you i just have first hand experience with people who are going through the same thing good luck man
409	1	i heard its a japanese store i am specifically looking for xmas decorations
410	1	it says in the article it will have a concession stand the proceeds of which are to be used for maintenance
411	1	because i want to hear real answers from real hawaiians
412	1	as someone that lived across from the park for a couple years and ran through it nearly every day i can assure you that its teaming with kids no matter the time of day or day of the week there are always plenty of little kids running around ala moana beach park they frequently stumble out in front of me going between the beach and their parents tent on the grass
413	1	trust me i wouldnt i would never do something like that
414	1	thanks for giving me a place to start my google search youd be amazed at how few resources show up when you dont have any idea where to start
415	1	also many contractors not those on block contracts that were already awarded but service contracts like janitors and such simply get laid off until the government reopens  and those are people even more likely to be living paycheck to paycheck
416	1	tru
417	1	chevron is in alaska are the same 711 did not do well up here
418	1	wtf are you talking about where the hell are you getting fined for having your dog every beach i go to daily all over the island i see dogs and bring mines yeah there are parks you cannot bring your dogs but those exist in every state finding a pet friendly rental will be difficult but not impossible much more difficult if youre not on island i make 35hour and i have no trouble making my bills live on my own and have a cardogsmall apt stop with the nonsense
419	1	til jones act thats fucking stupid
420	1	i felt such excitement while i was reading your comment and then you went and reminded me about summer lol i honestly want to not go during the summer but really that is the only traveling window we have as a family if it was just me and my wife wed probably go late winter early spring thanks for the tip with the suica pass and wifi rental my wife and i was just talking about yen conversion and how much money to bring and international phone use how much was the wifi unit rental does that cover calls too also i hear japan doesnt really take credit cards  this kinda scares me because ive waltz away many years ago from using paper moneyin your opinion what would the average visitor spend on an average day im hoping that in the end when the itinerary and food and lodging and transportation  pocket money is finalized and summed up it doesnt really break the bank i already see my ideal budget going out the windowwas 6 nights in tokyo a long enough stay to really get to see the area and surrounding parts  im trying to get a feel for how long this trip should be  at first i thought a week then it turned into 10 days now im considering 2 weeks   only problem is that the longer i stay the more ill be spending hah hah    my wife and i just visited las vegas and we stayed 10 days everyone kept telling us that that was way too long they say 34 days tops   but im glad that we stayed 10  we were able to sleep in go at our own pace enjoy the strip visit the attractions outside of the city etc  which made it feel like a real getaway rather than a rushed trip
421	1	i agree
422	1	i know if you are a usaa member or aaa they can sometimes wave the 25 and under rule it will take some digging but will be possible
423	1	sure but it is building individual homes that is the problem and there is a lot more undeveloped ag land much of it not used or not used well unfortunately the parts that theyre developing now hoopili and koa ridge are among the best  honolulu proper from kalihi to diamond head is about 16000 acres and has about 300000 people living in it  there is roughly the same amount of space available in both kapoleiewa and waialuahaleiwa such that they could each have another city that size but right now theyve only got about 53000 and 10000 people living in them respectively
424	1	awesome thanks so much ill look into it
425	1	meaning gabbard is like hillary clinton seems quite the opposite to me clinton was perceived as out of touch war mongering and completely lacking in charisma it is possible that the young voters galvanized by sanders might also find gabbard compelling you may still be right that she is unelectable but it would be for different reasons than 2016 back then i was hoping that bernie sanders would pick her as his vp candidate
426	1	if he was involved in her crimes then defending her may be like defending himself she may also have dirt on him too should he become a main target of investigation but this is only speculation of course
427	1	plus its not like theyll be here frequently like some other artists out there gotta live a little sometimes
428	1	because detecting icbm is as fast as possible isnt a good thing
429	1	yea because youre not inslulting us as well  again stop acting pretentious  you comment on us locals as if you know better than us  you dont understand what my people have been thru youre just quick to throw out insults at us  again you wanna talk about how we should behave but yet you wasnt born and raise here  what does that say  you quick to tell us how my people are wrong but yet you dont take the time to understand our side  just go back to the mainland if thats how your mentality is
430	1	no it is course in this case
431	1	you sound like an absolute loon
432	1	yeah i know that but i mean just look at that i never saw this when i lived on the mainland only in hawaii do you see this kind of shit xd
433	1	quality is a step above dollar stores imo also at daiso in the uae there are some higher priced items it is pretty much the place to go for western holiday items and we bought our christmas tree there
434	1	oh sorry thanks
435	1	unfortunately the most publicized stats like the point in time pit count of which i participate in each year is extremely inaccurate in getting a holistic view of our homeless for example this year we saw a huge drop off of volunteers doing the counting which resulted in huge areas of the island not even having counters in turn our count was very low politicians saw the count low and pitched the stories to news outlets as a success in their policies nothing can be further from the truththe way many of our organizations obtain a more accurate snapshot of demographics is from who is utilizing services these stats are tracked each year from our individual outreach efforts we track each encounter and service fairs which only certain parts of the island even haveannual utilization of services stats are available here httpuhfamilyhawaiieduprojectshomelesspublicationsaspxthe top demographics fluctuate between native hawaiians and caucasians but mostly lean native hawaiian this is even more upsetting when you compare the  of the population of each demographic and the rate they become homeless place of birth always is largely hawaii also other studies have given more accurate information on the silent homeless population in our state that are not the visible individuals who pan handle hang around waikiki andor chinatown many believe that this problem is more widespread than we can predictfor examplehttpuhfamilyhawaiiedupublicationsbrochures3ff7d_street20youth20study013118_finalpdfour youth homelessness is one of the most hidden travesties in our islands it is a lot worse when you factor in all the youth who are involved in the sex trafficking trade as well
436	1	you dont need to be bruce lee to hit a wouldbe assailant in the eyes throat or testicles a nut shot could take any man down amiritebut sure lets push guns on little old ladies that can barely read a stop sign or people with limited motor skills totally makes sense
437	1	kelloggs new scorpionfish flavor xd
438	1	oh i guess it does boddah you
439	1	every time i have the rent raised on me by the property management company i call them to get them to fix something to even it out last time i had it raised i complained to them about my toilet and the time before that i told them about my refrigeratorif youre going to force me to pay more per month and make it harder for me to live paycheck to paycheck im going to make sure i get my end of the deal
440	1	and a hungryhungryhawaiian shout out
441	1	it tastes better than it looks i thought it was repulsive at first i ended up finishing the whole thingit is nothing like poke as long as i think of it as a ahi tuna salad it is pretty ono
442	1	tibet was part of china for 1000 years thats hardly colonization china certainly has a stronger claim to tibet than israels claim to palestine if richard gere appropriated hawaiian culture instead of tibetan perhaps youd view things differently
443	1	maikai i saw the exact same thing happen last year except it was on the mainland at the carson city walmart across from costco i followed the man outside while keeping some distance so he wouldnt think to use the kid as a hostage and both the store manager and the police showed up in minutes because i grabbed my walking cane along the way which i had every intention of using as a weapon internal cameras showed the whole thing he just whipped the kid across the face i coudnt believe it still cant no idea if the kid is okay or not hope he is
444	1	you are truly a sad little specimen do you actually believe your stupid little book makes a difference get it into your skull politicians make their decisions based on money they dont give a flying fuck about your willingness to sit down and consider opposing arguments you are like a whiny little chihuahua that thinks he is a lion
445	1	i sure hope the why gets answered either way this is getting good popcorn time
446	1	i guess we should all give up our rights and tools to protect ourselves because we might be victims of other crimes the cdc estimates between 500000 and 3 million defensive gun uses per year anticcw laws get people hurt
447	1	i doubt their cat crossed the island to get there though
448	1	but they still needed the backing of the us military force to overthrow the hawaiian monarchy correct
449	1	was thinking about doing this  we are staying for 6 days any tips on how we can get a hold of a shower etc
450	1	do not geevum  a psychotically twisted deadly wreckage of a scene in bloody hell
451	1	nah im purposely doing it to annoy the fuck out of you and you are  were too stupid to catch on so much critical thinking you have there
452	1	i rarely ever swear in public  bitch was said quietly and in reaction to her swearing at me and i ignored her after that  i agree that kids should be polite in public and private but just wanted to rant about this incident  i also lived on the mainland for a while bay area and the entitlement there isnt as bad as that from the midwest and east coast but i thought hawaii especially in the burbs would not be as triggered as this aunt was  but some titas just gotta be titas
453	1	i dont like it but everyone on maui always says just go to foodland
454	1	ahahahahahaha
455	1	let me help you get it stuck in your head toohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvr7sw5aox2_i

458	1	you kinda dumb ah
459	1	ive watched castaway
460	1	id rather go to the source
461	1	i honestly know little about fsma besides that it is targeting the wrong thing it is large operations that mix stuff from far too many sources that is the problemlook at the chinese milk powder scare which would have been way smaller if they just used smaller batches does it make selling a tomato that has some dirt on it illegal
462	1	it still is
463	1	gt fireworks arent cheapexactly this people who set off those loud as aerials are trying to flex and dont give a shit about gt veterans with ptsd people with little babies or elderly or sick folks just trying to fuckin sleep
464	1	mahalos
465	1	mcdonald is is an excellent example of american is clinging to their culture enough people said i dont like hawaiian food i like mcdonald is so now we have mcdonald is i think it is more important to look at how business decisions affect a culture especially hawaiian given its history and relative size rather than the amount of money a foreign corporation makes i wont even begin to get into how food and sugar has negatively affected people is health here in hawaiiyour opinion of my attitude is merely an opinion i think you and many others misunderstand me though my actual attitude whether or not you perceive it that way is one of attempted understanding if that is wrong or obnoxious i do not wish to be right nobody has made an actual attempt to refute a single premise so i can only assume that i my hypothesis is correct it is a little troubling to me that the best explanation is money that is merely stating the obvious im wondering why there is money in selling japanese trinkets at an exorbitant markup on our little islandif japanese people or american or whatever nationality moving to hawaii really liked the culture then why are they compelled to perpetuate their native culture on these tiny islands instead of embracing the localnative one it is funny you use the word society which i never used or alluded to because oahu is not really a society in the way most people would recognize it is more a conglomerate of separate societies living in conflict so maybe my initial post was a little oversimplifiedit is hard to write succinctly on the internet but everything ive laid out is logical is verifiable through observation and has not been refuted
466	1	as a cyclist who has cycled in many states i have never feared for my life more than in hawaii i have never had people try to hit me anywhere else  it is absolutely insane  i bought a car there is no aloha for cyclists
467	1	wow thank you for sharing those pages i knew about ssh but didnt know about paw posse we find a lot of lost or abandoned pets in our area and im always trying to help get them home or find a new family that page will help immensely
468	1	take this all with a grain of salt this guy has an exaggerated view about the evils of the hawaiian culture he has pontificated before about how much better the west was
469	1	pitcairn had a particularly horrendous culture of child rapeincest  charges were finally brought up less than 10 years ago yea in general closed isolated societies with infallible leaders can go really bad really fast for a long time if the leader is bad
470	1	vegan hills closed simple joy is very tasty try the pumpkin soup
471	1	also the wiliwili gall wasp was decimating wiliwili trees and literally was going to wipe the whole population from the state  they did a lot of careful research and found a parasitoid that did not effect other species here and introduced it  has been considered an extremely successful biocontrol with no negative side effects so far and the wiliwili is finally coming back
472	1	very true stopping when it is clear to let someone turn in front of you may be courteous but it sure isnt predictable and can cause a wreck ill take a predictable driver over a courteous driver to share the road with any day
473	1	the daiso where i live in japan has mostly chinese made stuff
474	1	looks like mr rex kwondo is trying to say that fancy karate moves are better than a loaded gunhttpsyoutube9b3oem_56jgand bruce lee did indeed own and carry handguns
475	1	as someone who lived in one of those high rises and is still paying the 1000mo hoa fees but moved back to the mainland i can assure you that youre correct i ran through the park every day but never hung out in the park the concept of setting up tents in a public park or grilling by the sidewalk is foreign to me and it was exclusively islanders doing that stuff even for holidays with magic island fireworks it was less crowded and more convenient to watch them from the pool deck than to go down to the park i hadhave about 30 friends amp neighbors living on that block and they all had the same attitude the park was for running or walking the dog when we wanted to go to the beach wed usually drive to lanikai or kailua in the two years that i lived in that condo i think i walked out onto the sand at ala moana beach twice if people want to make the park better because they have to look at it out their window let them and enjoy it
476	1	it did i was so worried that it wasnt going to lol thanks for asking i hope you get the chance to try it soon
477	1	urine and vinager is slightly acidic the acid breaks down the protein from jellyfish stings and can ease pain vinager is stonger and works better  for wana it doesnt work well because the toxin is deeper and not topical where the acid can break it down faster
478	1	thank you so much
479	1	ask better questions
480	1	what is sad is the no one is putting money in to their kid is education funds that is the saddest thing about these trucks  materialism is king here money is spent to show its presencebut the answer to the question of where are people getting the money many of those that dont have decent jobs live in multigenerational households which makes living in hawaii significantly more affordable
481	1	a bb gun to shoot snails the hell
482	1	not rly i just like old tech fixing it up would be fun though
483	1	there is a good one on date street opposite of the ala wai golf course  k nakamura nurseryalso i know kapiolani community college has a xeroscaping exhibit right outside their admissions center  i think if op gets in contact with their botany department theyll be happy to provide cutsroots for planting

488	1	i was wondering that too in the other photos i thought it was just a paddle or driftwood but he is in full character mode
489	1	farmers market
490	1	thank you so much for this insanely helpful comment we have forwarded this to the cat owner
491	1	what he did has nothing at all to do with being hawaiian and i guess since he is a bit of a hawaiian celebrity people expect him to do things hawaiian  especially since he made a big fuss over being hawaiian and protesting the telescope drawing in thousands of nonhawaiians and nonresident on to his side  here is an opinion piece on the subject httpsistuffconzentertainmentfilm109363574aquamanandjasonmomoawhatswiththehawaiianhunkofaherowhodoeshaka

496	1	i dont give a shit i have been sent death threats by gamergaters chapohouse fucking asshole and rose twitter nearly assaulted by bernie bros when wore a clinton tshirt how the fuck am i one the label crazy when i fucking swear but yet the racist tweets coming out of bernie is mouth to pretty much stealing the title if his book from martin luther king jr isnt seen as populist bullshit he should have been disqualified along tulsi and all the idiots long time ago for being a dumbass and russia puppet his rape essay the fact he didnt have a job till he was 30 or the fact that he was kicked off a commune for not helping out and calls himself a socialist fuck em if i m appearing crazy for swearing and getting death threats from them then the world is fucked up as evidence by trumpand it is a lie berniebros didnt vote for clinton over trumphttpsmobiletwittercomforecasterentenstatus900442254426427394lange so fuck them
497	1	gti have friends of all varieties and they all view beating children as horrible and completely unacceptable theyre filipino hawaiian portuguese haole popolo and everything else it is not acceptable for the vast majority of the population here for really obvious reasonsthats not sharing your same view on discipline  you really dont know whats going on do you
498	1	oahu lifeguards have it too sausage king
499	1	when people say this theyre mostly talking about tech jobs in similar col areas to hawaii sf etc which makes sense given reddit is demographics or theyre explicitly adjusting for cost of living
500	1	yes paia is very close to peahi it is a cool town and you should go watch any big wave surfers who are doing their thing it is amazing to see in person
501	1	no i never insulted u just questioned the merits of ur story because i felt1 this story was not the right place to tell ur story  maybe in a thread about abuse it would be   tua tongavailoa isnt telling u a story about abuse  hes telling the reporter about how he was raised and about the family he loves and how it shaped him to be who he is  hes not telling us a story about assault and how justice needs to be done to his father  now because yall cant understand his point of view the only thing the article and ppl like u take out of it was that tui was abused2 as i read ur story i felt like u were harboring vitriol for local ppl you said big local man like why was that an important detail let me see a polynesian man tells us how he was raised so bring up a story of how u intervened in an assault between a big local man and his child  and thus linking tuis father to a potential criminal u even shared ur own story of abuse which i am deeply sorry that happened to u but tui doesnt view his childhood as abuse so ur experience does not connect with his and by making these connections ur saying it does ur saying tui was abused when many hawaiians and poly ppl view it as a normal upbringing so in essence ur saying our normal upbringing is wrong u also clarified that u dont believe in corporal punishment at all so when i say difference between abuse and discipline its different for u u view it all as assault hence even if that local man didnt assault his son to some ppl it wouldnt matter cuz u view it all as assault3 than u said nobody did anything and went on with the party this is where our experiences in life impact our perspective u told to the story to point out a big of a hero u are in ur point of view  and everyone else were apathetic assholes who dont care for children i cant argue against what u saw and how u feel im just trying to see if u understand that not everyone sees things the same way  and calling the cops is a potentially lethal act  and we dont want ppl dying just because cultures attitudes and point of views clashed  do the right thing i encourage that but dont share the story where it doesnt belong  and dont think that the right thing is how u see them and not weight out the consequences before u actedit even though situation may have been black and white i wont argue against that cuz frankly i wasnt there  the way u told definitely wasnt black and white and if u told it in a court of law a lawyer could have torn it to shreds
502	1	gotta wonder if the dangerous instrument mentioned in the article was a uke

510	1	i agree the owner is aggressively vegan but are they really a part of a cult
511	1	mahantongo gold
512	1	must have rocking indian stores of all types in the me eh
513	1	haha thats true its truly been the saddest part of my pregnancy not eating tuna subbing salmon in a poke bowl just isnt the same
514	1	gis
515	1	the same way drugs get in
516	1	yeah can get crazy on the bombs and current during winter definitely the best place to go enjoy the sunrise during the summer gotta go super early
517	1	haha
518	1	yesss ive been called a boss
519	1	also my boyfriend 60 170lb said he spends about 200month on groceries as well hell buy whatever is on sale but eats a lot of cereal pasta chili curries  quesadillas
520	1	the funny thing is seeing guys driving uber or delivering pizza on the side with really nice cars why not just drive a hoopty and live within your means you wouldnt need a second job to have a nice car then
521	1	bro he posts in rbraincels all the time
522	1	theres an upside of meth and it doesnt seem like hpd wants to deal with itjust cruise downtownchinatownaala park area and youll see users there really should be sting operations to catch dealers and force them to flip up the chain
523	1	ive had one haha the tofu part is ok but the rice is brown rice  really plain and doesnt hold together well i wont be getting more i do like the miso salmon rolls
524	1	plus it is going to be a fenced in playground right who wants to bet that the condo associations are going to insist on security guards and other policies to effectively ensure that only the right sort of people is kids get to play therei harbor some concerns over this venture
525	1	wow that explanation helps in so many ways
526	1	actually yah we have salty food here too we just have rice to balance out the saltiness

528	1	thank you i have rented vespas in europe and once i became confident with the right side of the road it felt like riding my motorcycle everyday defensive riding at all times
529	1	then why do you think personal pay would enter into their decisionmaking at all  even poor congresspeople arent going to feel a lick of pain until well after masses of workers are already suffering  by the time one of them would be motivated by needing to put food on the table theyve already lost their next election due to the widespread hardship among their constituents  the longest shutdown in history was 21 days and all without any direct personal incentives on either side to resolve the situation
530	1	to each their own but i always get the fresh
531	1	yeah last year nye
532	1	at least its not as bad as the typical novel post gtim going to write a love story set in ancient hawaii prince boto on the main island will rescue princess shishi of ohau from the evil tiger queen of the island of kawaiii  in the end boto and shishi will ride across the haliackala dessert sands of maugli island into the setting sun on their black stallion howpiagtand no ive never been to hawaii but no one will know it calls to me

534	1	i went to suisan like 2 weeks ago and the fish wasnt really fresh was so disappointed
535	1	uh you dont have lifeguards at all hawaii county beaches the most obvious is kua bay that beach has waaaay more liability than a playground there is no chlorination there is no pool i think you might not have seen these in use imagine a shower i get it we shouldnt ever do anything that could add to any future costs  i am just really glad that the people posting here had no say during the creation of ala moana beach park or magic island cause it is also artificial and added liability and added long term cost and is hugely wildly popular realistically we should close ala moana it requires maintenance we should have kept it a coral quarry same with the carnegie libraries  free libraryfrom a rich guy sounds like a scam we should have rejected the hawaii state library downtown  it requires maintenance the front steps are made of stone people could fall kids could sue there are balconies these are dangerous rich people probably used it to increase property values
536	1	ill check it out thanks
537	1	you misspelled months starts every year around halloween
538	1	damn im def not looking to be a hitchhiking camping hippy i can fully support myself just curious what it feels like day to day to live on the island im sure ill have some reality checks and im sure ill fall even more in love with kauai when i visit thanks for your response friend
539	1	yeah of course star fruit is fine as are mountain apples guava coffee berries etc there are also berries that looks just like poison berrieshttpwwwinstanthawaiicomcgibinhawaiiplantsohelo so people should be careful
540	1	yes i remember thinking it needs the same sauce as the teriyaki spam musubi
541	1	which would most likely be what happens
542	1	haha youve never made me regret my posts about my dogs more i feel so judged  nevertheless i do appreciate the advice we want to move for personal reasons that are important to how we want to live our lives we dont have jobs lined up but we are prepared to do so if we find that it is possible to live our lives in hawaii which is why i am doing research and asking questions
543	1	gt fsma compliantthats the problem politicians using scapegoats
544	1	yeah thats how it is around every airport ill bus to waikiki and roam til the flow finds me  i assume theres always something happening
545	1	much better thank you for asking finally started the second trimester so shes not throwing up as much anymore lol shes got a little bump now too so shes enjoying the attention and unexpected belly rubs
546	1	just like i said below  go to ala moana park on any given weekend and look at who is setting up tents for barbecues  its not those condo owners that are paying 1000 hoa fees for their own private pools and bbq spaces  its local families
547	1	scoot is ending the honolulujapan flights next spring
548	1	i didnt get a chance to try it today didnt ride the bus  did you if so did it work today
549	1	so even back then everything in the hawaii context was fecking expensive
550	1	i would also like this for christmas please and thank you

554	1	lol i know i figured id get more replies with a dumb idea the bus to waikiki seems like the option im going for
555	1	x3 for stepping stones our daughter was there from 6 weeks till 3 years old we both loved it she is at a different private preschool now and we hate it doesnt compare to the quality of care she got at stepping stones
556	1	no your just coming across as stupid as them no the op just made snide remarks about clinton being out of touch war monger and hoping bernie would pick war crime supporter tulsi as his vp  proving you have barely any reading comprehension skills so i doubting you have any critical thinking ability at all like all of reddityes it is a free cuntry so keeping that idiot after all this hold subs supports ayn rand ideology for tmt so progressivegt the native americans hawaiians didnt have any rights to the land and there was no reason for anyone to grant them rights which they had not conceived and were not using what was it they were fighting for if they opposed white men science on this continent island for their wish to continue a primitive existence their right to keep part of the earth untouched unused and not even as property just keep everybody out so that you will live practically like an animal or maybe few caves above it sacred any white person who brought the element of civilization science had the right to take over this continent  these islands the mountain
557	1	we have uber and lyft from the airport you just have to go to the second floor because theyll only pick you up from select spots on the departures level
558	1	if you think that every island has an active volcano then you need to do further research
559	1	why arent those cats trapped and either re homed if social enough or killed  also the stoats are yuck
560	1	when i moved to oahu i lived off spam musubi for the first week

563	1	old man it is pass your bed time are your diapers still dry or did you shit yourself again
564	1	i figured as much would you suggest not informing them of the esa beforehand iirc i legally dont have to say anything until i move the dog in but ive always thought that was a bit dubiousmight get my landlord amp i off on the wrong foot dunno if you have any experience personally with this but for documentation will having a local doctor make things easier ive been waffling back and forth on whether to set up appointmentsrelationships in advance since im not sure what my insurance will be but i imagine wait times on oahu can be pretty insane
565	1	i agree someone without family or partner could easily get no physical contact touch releases oxytocin which is important for psychological well being
566	1	they are still out there you just gotta hunt for em mainstream music has gone to crap but there are still many talented unknown artists
567	1	1 in places like downtown buildings block a lot of the signal so you need a lot more2 i expect most of this is for the forthcoming deployment of 5g signal which has shorter range and less penetration due to the wavelength it uses3 if youre super concerned about privacy you shouldnt be using any wireless device at all
568	1	not really anymore im coming from va to hawaii and ive done all the new processes you can get all the shots micro chip and blood test within 30 days and youre good as long as you have the health certificate found a place to live as well they are out there
569	1	doesnt matter tulsi garbbage is horrible and your are replying to comments i replied to another bernie supporter dumbass yeah my reading comprehension is so bad when your comment comes 1 level above a trump tweetsorry i had to dumb it down it to you since you write like trump i need to talk to you like trump
570	1	haha read it still terrifying and crazy impressive
571	1	it is really not
572	1	why so many down votes  is it because polynesian culture encompasses both

582	1	no where the fuck is the outrage over a current issue instead of one that happened in the past when times are changing and old jokes and songs were a product of their time but yet they whole outrage culture thrown at them yet when something more current that can be dealt with now is ignored constantly fuck pewdiepie just supported a white supremacists channel and the media is going off and when an asian gets hit with some racism it gets a blip on the radar httpnextsharkcomjoelkimboostermoviescripthave you hear of this story where is the outrage where are the same people outraged over kevin hart outraged of this and yeah people should be more outraged at facebook but they are not so fuck it i m pissed off i m angry and i aint going to take shit from bernie bros and others like him whether it be gamergate rose twitter and other pieces of shitand i m fucking tired of hearing thishttpsiimgurcomc1zohwwgifv

584	1	i didnt say anything about race hawaii is a multicultural kingdom always has been its about   allegiance if your family was kamaaina they swore loyalty to hawaii which makes you a traitor in the country you occupy but yeah keep making haole assumptions expect to be treated as such
585	1	mmmm i guess youre just ky then lol
586	1	thats where renting a car for a week or two to explore comes in i mean you could definitely ship a motorcycle here and then sell it hi is a good market for selling used vehicles not sure about motorcycles but im sure it would sell well

589	1	id be curious too  not sure if you meant that transient transplants are increasing or transplants overall are increasing  it does seem like there are more transplants around these days
590	1	from my experience it seems the poorer and more violent an area the more machismo the culture of that area has
591	1	good eye
592	1	did you open a case with etsy it can take awhile to get your money back but it will usually get to you if the seller is obviously in the wrong
593	1	which proves that you dont need to pay an arm and a leg for your child to be on the top
594	1	what is that thing on its nose and what about heineken
595	1	yeeeah id be careful of keehi lagoon unless youre into some dark tourist honolulu strangler sightseeing at night it is mostly a homeless encampment and a feral cat colony
596	1	i stopped going to ono because they are so inconsistent  i usually got the wasabi ahi sometimes it was 0 spice sometimes it was borderline inedibly hot  sometimes it was ridiculously salty other times it was fine  never the same poke twice  id rather not deal with shitty kapahulu traffic their shitty parking and their attitude if there is a 25 chance i wont even want to finish my poke bowl
597	1	thank you googling this story only brought up other news sites that cut and pasted half of the press release the laziness at many of these news stations in astounding we literally worked harder to interview people at my undergrad university newspaper
598	1	thanks
599	1	i understand what youre saying thank you for the advice definitely helps my research
600	1	fellow punch card user 72 columns ftw
601	1	immoral people are always willing to diminish the concerns of the moral no surprise there
602	1	as an air national guardsman who has done potus support work during obamas visit hell yeah its a lot nicer to not have to work during the holidaysthat said i dont resent obama for it at all
603	1	do you live in oahu im making a bit more than that and am about to buy a house but i live on the big island i can see doing that on oahu or maui being basically impossible
604	1	hopefully you get it soon its fun as hell
605	1	because i dont give a flyig fuck about your opinion
606	1	thats it thank you
607	1	the primary care physicians stat surprised me i thought we had a doctor shortage
608	1	yeah and you one of the idiots that let ted cruz and rest rise tonpwer sit down shut up and let us who are willing to fight the lefts dumbasses fight the pieces of shit like tulsi and kaniela like the pieces of shit they are so benrie can go back to renaming post offices
609	1	in due time just not there yet
610	1	that is really helpful ive seen that in my local library thanks for giving me a place to start looking
611	1	i hope you arent saying youd seek a return to kamehemeha is kingdom  i could understand why liliuo wouldnt want to return to the kapu system which had the effect of women being disproportionately being murdered for the numerous violations they could engage in once a month during their menstruation when they were considered unclean haumia and unlucky poino  during this period women were forced to stay isolated in the hale peahere is a list of things only a man could eat to a woman consumption of these foods carried the death penalty pork bananas coconuts shark sea turtle whale ray many other fishesas many know men and women were forced to eat separately on penalty of death in their separate eating houses the mua for men and the hale aina for women  this was thanks to the pervert god wakea hawaiian adam trying make time to sneak away from his wife papa eve to have sex with his daughter hoohokukalaniit didnt just suck to be a woman it just sucked to exist unless you were an alii  perhaps you envision yourself a king but then youd probably have to partner up with your sister because a sister was usually the only person of high enough rank to be suitable  however you could fuck as many commoner women as you want so long as if they have your child that child is promptly dashed against the rocksno one here wants to live in a 19th century christian or catholic world  hell id hope there is a good many that barely tolerate the 21st century christiancatholic world  but when you actually get to the nitty gritty of how awful ancient hawaii was for most people youd see why a sexually repressive bunch of prudes that at least wont kill you for entering their shadow might seem like a welcome change  and when you think of how people like queen kaahumanu who was forced to marry and sleep with an elder kamehameha when she was just 16 might not give a fuck about preserving the kingdom as it was under her husband  we can only imagine how wonderful it was to see the heiaus fall and the idols burnededit for those unfamiliar with the history the destruction of the kapu including the heiaus and idols was done by kaahumanu and kamehameha ii  people who romanticize the kapu period say they were forced to do this by the missionaries and while the missionaries did not like the sexually liberated culture of ancient hawaii one bit there is no evidence to support the theory that kaahumanu and kamehameha ii oversaw the end of the kapu against their will
612	1	throwaway  ill never forget ikaika beating me up first day of school at hahaione  always trying to fit in with the cool crowdkid was always kinda off but when i talked to him a few times at kaiser seemed like he was getting his shit together  i remember he told me he had to study to get into college he was behind had to catch upnever wouldve expected him to turn isis though
613	1	nope not what im trying to say missing my point entirely just like the all the rest of the socalled gun enthusiasts in heretry again unless you want to get roundhoused by these bad boyshttpfilmgarbcomwpcontentuploadsfilmnapoleon_dynamite2004rexdiedrich_baderus_flag_pants595x335jpg
614	1	i dont know why this isnt more striking but youre right  maui is another one  other busy airports are attractions in and of themselves  ours is like a weigh station
615	1	is there one in ny metro
616	1	im constantly reminded of the fact that tons of people are so ignorant of food common to different cultures
617	1	like his quick wit
618	1	discovered for them
619	1	yah ive read a lot on the japan travel sub tripadvisor other sites about doing the tokyo kyoto osaka thing and as you say most advise against doing all three in one go  im now considering 14 days but even then i think it is still an osakakyoto vs tokyo decisionif it is between the two osakakyoto vs tokyo which of them would you recommend for a first timer to get a good feel of what japan is   i know it is like saying maui vs oahu vs hawaii vs kaui you cant have the whole hawaii experience unless you island hopconsidering summer humidity ive read more suggesting tokyo over kyoto and osaka  and if summer is the only season then as close to early june as possible because the closer it gets to august the worse   waitam i wrong to assume that japan has buildings with fully equipped with ac units  would i realistically be in humid weather the whole time
620	1	this is actually the best advice and should be played over a loudspeaker on every in bound flight to hi if you look out at the water and no locals are looking back dont go in
621	1	essential federal workers continue to get paid they dont have to wait for retroactive paysource essential federal worker who just got paid todayedit thanks for correcting me i guess it was technically pay for prior work  have to wait another 2 weeks to find out
622	1	yeah i knew about the quarantine that and the lack of petfriendliness is why im keeping my petpets on the mainland at least until i figure out whether im staying for the long haul i need the dog though i have the hawaii civil rights commission is contact info so i will probably work with them once im on the island before i rent a place long term i was just hoping someone here had dealt with getting an accommodation request granted esp with a large dog
623	1	you would honestly be better off with martial arts training then a ccw against a guy acting erratically with a blunt object
624	1	ahhhh the actual backstory proof that all the aloha shit is really just to sell to touristwhen i first arrived my friend told me this isnt the aloha state its the selfish stateat first i didnt understand but things like this really put it into perspective

641	1	first time here my parents moved here couple years ago its a magical town
642	1	kahala grows here much better than shipping in cans of processed meat
643	1	interesting even the linked article oversells the idea of hawaii being the victim of sales exploitation
644	1	yeshttpswwwvicecomen_usarticlekwkaz9therestaurantchainownedbyacultnext time you are there look at the tv it is playing the cult tv channel there are loving hut restaurants all over the world it is all good they seem harmless enough and make tasty food
645	1	just seriously you are right being a senior who has no family no significant other feeling often alone and abandoneda hug makes you feel like you still should be alive on this earth
646	1	india market on beretania and oliver next to olive tree cafe in kahala does

648	1	thank you i will post it there
649	1	and kalbi and hell anything with shoyu is salty
650	1	we got her in the mainland since we were living there for a few years moved back to hawaii with herhuskies generally can handle the heat provided you dont take them out during the day we restrict her exercises and walks in the morning or presunset times obviously if there is exercise during the day we take her to the beach and take her for a dip to keep her cool additionally contrary to what you might think you should not thin their coats as their coats provide as an insulation from absorbing too much heat really just use common sense ie dont leave in car dont leave her in an area that absorbs heat like concrete shes been happy with the beach visits
651	1	i really like loving hut but they are part of a weird cult still my go to for veggie american style chinese food
652	1	im actually tone deaf and this has been a daily reminder

656	1	turo is annoying you cant message the person until after you book it and pay deposit which to me makes no sense if you have any questions about the car you cant ask until after you have committed it is the one reason i have yet to use turo wish it was more like airbnb where you can have open discussion with the renter and ask lots of questions and have confidence in what you are renting
657	1	it is perfectly reasonable to not understand someone who has a strong accent different from yours it is not at all reasonable to move to a place and call in to complain about the hosts accent
658	1	my mom recently moved to a small town in colorado to be close to my auntie and i have a hard time believing that colorado is so healthy given how cardependent it is yeah you have a lot of hikey bikey types there but it is the kind of place where you need to get in your 4wd to go somewhere to hike and bike on the weekends not something that you fit into your daily routine i was at my healthiest when i was living in moiliili and working downtown and could walk to and from work on the weekends i would walk to restaurant row or waiks or even as far as kahala mall to catch a movie enjoying the sunshine and stopping for a bite along the way i hardly ever even needed to take the bus very hard to have a lifestyle like that on the mainland where everything is sprawled out and especially someplace like colorado where you freeze your alas off 8 months out of the year
659	1	i love zombies but zombies on an island sounds awesome
660	1	suisan is definitely action i see people mentioning umekes too which is nearly just as maaaayjah

666	1	that was really sad to read
667	1	found the trump supporter
668	1	i guess i can see how that might be construed advertising i removed the link but really just looking for merchandise made in hawaii
669	1	currently freezing in fort collins colorado i know what you mean by cardependent  having the mountains in my backyard is both a blessing and a curse  sure the trailhead is only 30 miles away but through the mountains itll take you at least an hour  add snow majority of the year at the fun elevations and youre better off just staying home haha i kid but seriously it is tough to remain motivated in the winter
670	1	youd think someone concerned with matters of indigenous solidarity would understand this china literally points to american imperialism in hawaii to justify their much less naked claim to tibet
671	1	hey man i see youre still down i know upat_trick already offered help but im available as well our company does a bunch of wordpress hosting and i know how the database works inside and out that is assuming the assholes didnt delete your files or data good luck  i appreciate everything that you do
672	1	i see where you were going with it but i think this is an anti capitalism comment commenter was stating that homeless people are victims of capitalism
673	1	cant be anything too big without some serious work  there is a huge underground drainage ditch that runs right through these properties  there was an old waterfilled cave system that fed springs all over moiliilil  the ponds at willows were originally natural springs
674	1	did you read the article  the volunteer group is headed by the coo of the kobyashi group the developer of the ultra luxury condos across the street from the park  seeking donations for what is essentially a selling point for their luxury condos is silly
675	1	gt this is the definition of whataboutismgt china certainly has a stronger claim to tibet than israels claim to palestine uhm
676	1	thanks for mentioning the japantravel sub
677	1	still doesnt stop me from loving that title though it is music to my eyes
678	1	i understand that not everyone understands my views either it be local or haole me and the other reddit user have history and constantly bump heads that comment was specifically written in direct context to her now if you were a local and said you think i shouldnt give my kids lickens i would tell you its none of your business you aint the person who cares about my child im the one who would provide and make sure theyre safe and modded into the person i want them to be i know the difference between discipline and abuse why would it be a concern to you on how i raise my child
679	1	i hate to admit it but i honestly agree being somewhere where it is perfectly legal then being here i honestly just hate the disadvantage sometimes and really feel for some of these guys especially some of the stories ive read coming from in town hpd is hit or miss
680	1	isnt lng mostly captured as a happy byproduct of fracking in the dakota is and canadaif that were the case how would it be considered clean
681	1	in the time it takes you to pull a gun and point it the guy can be all the way across the parking lot a gun is not the weapon you want in hand to hand combat
682	1	since apparently the haoles didnt do a good enough job the first time  exactly my point  thanks for exposing yourself for being the person you are  you will never understand my people  youre just like the others you came here to invade and try to impose your ideology on us kamaaina  stop trying to blend in with us we dont want the snake oil youre selling
683	1	im not but if all goes well ill have a pretty alright income for a grad student along with my so is webbased job we are halfheartedly considering buying but we wont be able to do a down payment and move to hawaii and im leery about investing in any leaseholder properties im sure you guys all know this but it is really hitting home for me that honolulu is real estate hell haha
684	1	well i have lived with him in places with housing shortages none so egregious as hi sure but i also have never tried to use the fha and fwiw all his vet records paperwork and such has him labeled as just a mixed breed not me being cute he came that way which is all my past landlords have cared about for insurancecovering their asses purposes  it helps that i have my own insurance as well and he is got his cgcado you know people who have been denied housing for an assistance animal i know people have them in honolulu and im sure people rent with them im looking for the best way to walk the tightrope of being flat out denied housing and having to pull a technically legal fast one on someone i prefer not to deal with realtors for rentals but that is looking more attractive by the second haha
685	1	cigarette boy is 29httpremovedditcomrhawaiicommentsa6valihow_much_are_cigarettes_where_you_livebut yes i do understand that a lot of older people never learned and somehow cant learn to do basic things on computers  that doesnt negate my assertion that there are a lot of younger people who are just damned lazy
686	1	im pretty sure that most new playgrounds are fenced mostly to prevent kids from running off  shiiit even the corner park in palolo has a fence
687	1	it is in my interest to finally have good cellphone reception the equipment needs to go somewhere especially for the new faster speeds that are around the corner ampx200bfyi these are not stingrays cellphone companies dont pay for those the government does a stingray imitates a cell tower and doesnt need to be mounted to a pole  ampx200bthese will be to provide the people of hawaii with better coverage if we nimby too hard then the cell companies will tell us to forget it and leave us behind the curve with no bars on our phones
688	1	right that is why you keep engaging go back to texas with you other dumbasses since you had to escape from there instead of fight against ted cruz louie gomert and the rest
689	1	gt your theory is that the without a personal pay incentive lawmakers will just ignore that hundreds of thousands of people are going hungry and suffer no consequences for it no it isnt
690	1	if you think anyone in here has been an asshole youre just another one of these super oversensitive types that the world is finding itself having to bend over backwards for to avoid hurting little feelings
691	1	oh my god yes
692	1	see my response to one_crack_nacnac below
693	1	i think youre thinking of that star wars movie
694	1	very helpful thank you see my response to urockriver74 below let me know
695	1	all that missing sand was brought from the north shore and dumped there around 1950  compare the 1949 picftpsoesthawaiieducoastalwebftpoahumosaicswaikiki_1949_mosjpg to the 1951 picftpsoesthawaiieducoastalwebftpoahumosaicswaikiki_1951_mosjpg  all of a sudden a ton of sand appears between the royal hawaiian and kaimana
696	1	there is very very little ammonia in urine though ammonia is the raw waste product your body makes but it is toxic so it gets converted into urea on the way so that it can be held temporarily
697	1	i knew i would find kahuku superette here one of the few good things about going to kahuku high school
698	1	have they stopped i mean i get being unhappy with a number of american policies and im all for reducing the military industrial complex is power and sway in american politics and policy but trump is not the answer to those problems
699	1	idk technically spam is already cooked completely thru you can eat it fresh out da can the big problem with those glaring grill marks is that is now burnt spam the secret to onokine spam is a hotmarinade coldmarinade makes it harder to bring the spam up to tempampx200b
700	1	always a good chance of that it seems
701	1	who started that incorrect rumorhttpwwwhawaiinewsnowcom20181222despiteclearvideoincidentsuspectbaseballrampagestilllarge
702	1	no worries try rhawaiivisitors instead
703	1	u sure about that feel sorry about children in my vicinity  damaged caused how exactly are we damaged because we disagree with u  because we love our parents and ppl why dont u go back and read all my comments with some understanding do hawaiians tear gas children at the border or separate children from their parents do hawaiians not believe in universal healthcare do hawaiians evict homeless ppl from their communities in fact do hawaiians believe u have to have money to not have shelter did the hawaiian way of life destroy the earth and cause global warming or persecute gays  thats white ppl shit that started in europe and was exported everywhereu think ur way is better than ours but it is america and white ppl that could learn a lot from indigenous cultures but for some reason yall are so hell bent on destroying them  and its not just white ppl of the past  white ppl love to believe their ancestors were scum bags and theyre woke and currently not  but that is far from the truth  white ppl still in the present day are wrecking shit for everybody  from gentrification to voting for a racist president to elevating profit over ppl and the earth  those are the problems the next generation of children and everyone is going to face
704	1	the state of hawaii legislature and county council didnt have the right to make hawaii a millionairs playground either with ultra luxury condos and regressive tax structure off the backs of native hawaiians but yet here we aremost of our homeless are either native hawaiian or locally born we shouldnt be villifying them taking out negative stereotypes out on them just a bit misguided imo  sorry to wag my finger at you im just not a fan of talking down on individuals who have it harder than the rest of us on while we use our fancy devices connected to internet is all i do outreach with our homeless and the majority of them are victims
705	1	number one im not offended  im simply trying to implore u to understand  u started the name calling not me in fact u called all of us who disagree with u assholes  did u vote for trump no but i bet u know ppl who did i havent met a single white person that doesnt have a family member who did because the only vote he won was the white ones i dont know anyone who voted for him and if i did flat out that family member would have had it from me and others in my family until they didntwhat clarifications did u ask me  ur only comments to me were insults and simplifications of my views followed by mocking my intelligence to others who agree with u  u see ppl of color are used to being individuals who represent an entire group of ppl  believe or not many of us feel like we have to behave a certain way because its representative of our ppl  thats y we try to act with aloha to everyone we meet  we are aware of what we project into the world and what stereotypes ppl are so willing to throw at us  like how u think every hawaiian is some blame whitey hypocrite  white ppl arent use to that and find it offensive if they are
706	1	king kalakaua himself wrote in his letters that he loved astronomyhttpswwwifahawaiieduuserssteigerhistorypdf and wanted telescopes on the islands for some reason that doesnt count but activists deciding in the 90 is that mauna kea was the most sacred somehow takes precedent over hawaiian history
707	1	thank you and to you
708	1	youre not supposed to confront people in public because youre only likely to worsen the situation
709	1	perhaps he just wanted to pay his respect to tangaroa there are a few kiwis doing the haka with him so i suspect they influenced and guided him either way it is cool and it is all over the news in nz
710	1	bango
711	1	gt he kingdom of hawaii was beyond a tribe instead a fully functioning government with citizens and treatiesa tribe is a form of government and many native americans formed more westernized forms of government
712	1	gta tropical cocktail made famous by trader vic bergeron in 1944 after mixing rum lime orange curacao orgeat and syrup with a spring of mint and fresh fruit garnish his tahitian friends named it with their native reply after tasting it mai tai meaning literally very goodthere you go coulda swore it was samoan but whatever
713	1	what do you mean
714	1	the paycheck you just got today that is from the two weeks ending right before the shutdown started
715	1	i meant exactly what i wrote you may interpret it any way you like
716	1	reading these comments is exactly like being out on the road  there doesnt seem to be any mutual respect for the other person is opinion regardless of which one may be right even if the person is right for different reasons
717	1	health insurance and out of pocket expenses was  63month
718	1	the riots in france are a lot more complicated than just being mad about a gas tax  it is because several administrations in a row now have been centrists and neoliberalsneoconservatives who prefer to work the budget by taxing the lower and middle classes and giving tax breaks to the richthat is what this tax does as well and the french middle class is pissed  they feel like theyre paying the entire share of the burden when corporations are producing the lion is share of the pollution
719	1	speaking of not giving a fuck httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqbclxzmmqns
720	1	yeah from what i saw from the bus window white plains was pretty big aswell on the ride home it had calmed though
721	1	i saw one uncovered on friday however the bus that i was on today still was covered but they still had me tap it
722	1	yeah youre handling it admirably pretty sure one of those shitsticks is a new account to replace the previous one that got banned the trolling and assholic language is sure reminiscent jokes about beating one is wife are just so edgy and hilarious
723	1	man theres parades every other week
724	1	you guessed it haha though closer to west central texas
725	1	tongs
726	1	how about you act like an actual grownup and stop making assumptions about a situation you clearly know nothing about great minds did not invent the internet so that petty ones like yourself could make references to panties you are as useless as the morons running our government
727	1	what did it feel like when you moved im assuming to the mainland as far as how you were seen
728	1	yeah this kind of indoctrination among all law enforcement agencies and the military shouldnt be targeted at youth  give them lollipops fine but this youre one of us now stuff is as  inappropriate as stuffing religion down a kid is throat
729	1	you think we should make it as easy as possible for people to kill themselves on the spur of the moment
730	1	dang is it really that bad for people coming with pets
731	1	no youre just a fucking idiot
732	1	just dont try to ship via usps tried to send a family member a bottle of wine and was told you cannot ship alcohol ups only allows authorized dealers to ship
733	1	steinlager
734	1	bro mountain apples and apple bananas are completely different things  the rust fungus attacks mountain apples and ohia nioi and other myrtaceae not bananas  polynesians did cultivate bananas but not apple bananas which are from the philippines  i agree that we should protect indigenous banana varieties but they are usually not very sweet compared to commercial bananas including apple bananas so few people plant them  there are banana pests like bunchy top virus but again totally different from mountain apple not a fungus etc  why did i just waste 5 minutes on moonworshiper again
735	1	thanks for the tip im taking it slow so public transit is ideal how is it going around the island
736	1	sounds like a failing of the justice system and not a good argument against self defense guns we gotta get on board with standing our ground and castle doctrine
737	1	she was also a full blown warhawk and islamophobe like 4 years ago going on fox news and criticizing obama for not explicitly calling terrorism islamic and for not bombing syria  add that to her previously viciously homophobic stances and she is poison to progressives  endorsing bernie was just a way to get attention not an expression of long held principles
738	1	the whole road    yes the dirt road too  the dirt road was actually a good road and less curvy with beautiful scenery everywhere  the winding parts are barely large enough for two cars and for those that are use to this road go much faster than most  so it does require complete attention just made me a bit dizzy in some spots
739	1	youve misspelled fuckface von clownstick
740	1	cant have a hawaiian music nostalgia session without mentioning kuu home o kahaluu if your grandpa was from the east side you gotta listen to this httpsyoutubehi0hkdyu1ty but really i think it captures the spirit of anyone who grew up here in the islandsedit oh and this is the original olomana version my parents and grandparents talk about hearing these guys play this song live and then talk about seeing braddah iz other people have posted some of his stuff here coming to play at bars and restaurants when he was a teenager and knowing he was gonna be a star good stuff sure your grandpa ran similar circles
741	1	yeah reminds me of that video of pig meat being unloaded onto the sidewalk at chinatown a few months back felt like people were severely overreacting
742	1	or go on an escalator its the most upheld orderly unwritten law ive ever observed
743	1	try boston  lived there for years and got around mostly on my bike  i got hit more times than i can remember and nearly run over twice  i had friends survive serious accidents  in all the years i rode here long time ago though i never experienced anything like in boston
744	1	genius
745	1	possibly however if he wanted one he could get one only difference is youre at a disadvantage gun ownership is at 40 percent in the state im not a huge gun person but ive lived in two different states that were strict on gun ownership and had some bad experiences it is a helpless feeling
746	1	yea  thats whats up
747	1	ffs youre a moderator and youre threatening to ban people because of your own reading comprehension problems
748	1	ive seen them in northern colorado in regular supermarkets occasionally
749	1	it is just a name but one name isnt inherently more significant than any other name it is a way to refer to a thing and it is the thing that is significant yes names carry meaning but the point is that the time and energy spent researching hawaiian culture to find a single word in a book that has nothing else to do with hawaiian culture except that generations and generations ago the engineer of the starship had a culture and backstory is a waste of time compared to you know the actual writing part  i can see where youre coming from but the fact is that the critics are making a lot of baseless assumptions   they assume that i just want to take one of them and copypaste it into a story where actually i just want a place to have some ideas where to start looking  they assume that the name is at all relevant to the story it is not any more than the name earth is relevant to gone with the wind   they assume it has literally anything to do with hawaiian culture it doesnt i admired a starlady on the radio who talked about her passion and her culture and figured she was the kind of person who would invent a starship she happened to be hawaiian   some criticism is absolutely valid but when the critics are absolutely ignorant of what theyre criticizing it doesnt actually do anything except make them look like assholes at least all66es had a sense of humor about it jello was actually helpful giving me a place to start looking
750	1	lol youre a freaking asshole magnet tonight
751	1	listen up im not paid to babysit corrupt politicians through their time wasting circle jerking policy making that is their job i went out of my way to inform not only the dfi but my local legislators about cryptocurrency and the asinine redundancy of their interpretation of law that forced coinbase to withdrawal furthermore i did not want that law enacted get some reading comprehension
752	1	you know i did something once when my old next door neighbors got some m80s i just put on some loud japanese anime song on full volume and pt a speaker outside note i got permission from my neighborhood owners who also lived next door and were tired of the fireworks now my neighborhood owners moved and a new neighbor is launching fireworks there
753	1	neither down by barber is point airfield weird location but that is where it is freshest and has the best selection
754	1	just to nitpick the queen was not deposed by us military interests but by sugar interests many of them born and raised in hawaii eg sanford dole and lorin thurston they were white but at least third generation and not american citizens also us foreign minister stevens wasnt about promoting us military interests as much as white male christian sovereignty
755	1	calling me an idiot way to degrade any validity your point may have had i look like a bastion of reason compared to youstop being so sensitive its annoying as fuck
756	1	theyre high in puna
757	1	there is a ton on youtube  or bigislandvideonewscom
758	1	i didnt go to either of those 2 schools and sure its not necessary but the fact that this is newsworthy shows how uncommon it is and that going to school of those 2s caliber really is a major advantage education wise
759	1	gt 2 native american seminomadic tribes were able to work out the logistics to build these boatsthere were a number of large settled civilizations in both north and south america who would have had the theoretical capability to do so but they were mostly located in the interior and those that were on the ocean just had no real reason to make oceangoing vessels
760	1	under the existing zoning code the only way the city can prove a property is being used as an illegal shortterm rental is to get either the owner or renters to admit theyre re ting t shortterm it is not illegal to advertise an illegal rental  also the state refuses to share tat info with the counties
761	1	my guess were not going to get it any better due to peering and bandwidth
762	1	i appreciate thatthank you  looking at oahu renting house apt condo townhome doesnt matter 700 sq ft
763	1	understandable we have not committed to hawaii simply doing research to know if we have realistic expectations  we thought it would be a good idea to get people is opinions from this sub which has proven helpful i dont think i need to go into detail about the personal reasons why we want to move there but we have been before and find it fits our lifestyle we are both in the itsoftware industry
764	1	im actually curious to try grilled spam wouldnt it be kind of like grilled hotdog
765	1	rat lung worm fills me with so much strength and makes me want to fight truly is our greatest kept secret
766	1	to chime in with what others said yeah as the universe gets older stars start exploding and neutron stars collide create the heavy elements we know during parts of the big bang some hydrogen also fused into helium and a tiny bit of other heavier elements lithium but not much else observing this cloud helps refine models of the early universe
767	1	play hard for sure im not saving up a bunch of money so i can see the bruno reunion tour in 30 years im playing now while im young
768	1	additionally she is 68 and still active laying eggs
769	1	he is
770	1	gt followers of the_donald believe trying to brigade smaller subreddits so that they will have more influence and it will be easier to recruit people to their sidemight want to slow your roll a little here  uanerriphtho_kybos is a different account from the op troll you first responded to and as far as i can see doesnt to have any history of posting to t_d or any of the other shitty subs  in his first post he even called him cheetoedit the op you said was a troll appears to post in rbigisland about mundane local stuff so im not sure even they deserve the mod reaction
771	1	how is living there with a husky did you come from the mainland with the husky or get your dog in hawaii we have always wanted to move but have a husky and werent sure how he would handle it
772	1	yes live on oahu if you have 2 people making good money in a house it can work
773	1	yeah i have attended one recently that is why i got a little bit interested about it
774	1	do you know if there are things like vespa rentals for people under 25 i looked and couldnt find information but i remember seeing a lot of people on scooters when i was there a few years ago
775	1	whered you go to law school at
776	1	uhhhhhttpstrumpgolfcountcom
777	1	it is been a big adjustment having lived in hawaii and then queens ny weather is killer hot from april through midoctober but winter is very nice arabic food is good but i miss a lot of local hawaii and ny food  we made chicken katsu and mac salad a couple of weeks ago and it came out really ono it is really easy to travel to europe and asia so that is a big plus  going to bangkok in a week for christmas
778	1	awesome  thank you
779	1	people say every post i make is a troll post what about asking about the safety of the water is trollish
780	1	a lot of the time they only allow a certain amount of visits a day so people probably dump the rest of their garbage here
781	1	sea world is kind of a shitshow most breeding programs are designed to bring back the population orcas are struggling to survive in the wild so breeding programs are important to their survival
782	1	gtthat is not the maori haka it is the samoan manu siva tau a samoan war dancesmh no it isnt fool
783	1	gt the majority of history books are full of garbage as wellyou know what makes history books better more records more data  if this statement was in anyway correct this would still be an argument in favor of reducing overdependence on oral traditionid love to hear your example of a history book that is not full of garbage to see where the bar is
784	1	what history book is claiming that the us used military force to over throw the queenif you want an excellent book that really goes into detail i recommend  taking hawaii how thirteen honolulu businessmen overthrew the queen of hawaii in 1893 with a bluff  the author really goes into detail if you want a 90 minute historical tour about the life of that last queen which includes the overthrow you can come on one of my free tours that i give once or twice a month
785	1	nicely done trollslayer
786	1	was i there i am not calling u a liar or anything but we only have ur perspective to go off of  where we were raised and how totally has to do with the situation to what extent i dont know  in ur story  u clearly pointed out it was some big local man which tbh i dont know why u felt the need to say that as opposed to some guy punched his kid twice  u also pointed out u couldnt believe it was happening in public and furthermore u were surprised nobody else did anything about it  if this was to happen say in san francisco the outcome of the story would have been much different maybe more ppl would of called the cops or confronted the man  thats simply my point  and quite frankly hawaiians are generally tired of being told how what and why to live our lives by haoles im not saying thats what ur doing  constitutes as that but just be aware that that elephant hangs around the room with stories like this
787	1	lol that doesnt even cover the association fee in my building
788	1	i agree but it is more than that too  partially it is about being lazy  i suspect it is also that op has no idea what he is looking for so wants to hear a story until something clicks  that is exactly what the internet is good for  i could go into rgermany and say tell me about wwii  it is ineffective and a waste of everyone is time if i dont know what im looking for in the first place  people dont know how to form a cogent thought any more they dont take the time to think before opening their mouth or posting on the net  wayfarer means wanderer by foot someone who travels by walking  i dont think that is what he had in mind  are the ships he is trying to name prisoner ships  garbage scows vessels of exploration  wouldnt it make sense to know that ahead of time  sorry just me being me again
789	1	ahemhttpstwittercomrealdonaldtrumpstatus521813597799067648langenim pretty sure that was a sarcastic imitation of trump is criticism of obama playing golfalso this in case there is a closer tweet elsewhere httpswwwsbnationcomgolf201732715073086donaldtrumptweetsbarackobamagolf
790	1	yep nobody in chinasingapore ever holds up the achievements of ancient china as things they are proud of  lol dumbest thing i read today and i was on rretconned earlier so that bar was low
791	1	that is why a gasoline tax isnt the way to go about that problem it needs to be a tax on the wealthy or tax credits for going electric
792	1	and then we still wont do anything unless we have to
793	1	yea i know this will surprise you but im not a professional writer
794	1	if you heard fireworks going bonkers this evening after the fight those were my immediate neighbors but at least they have the courtesy to cut it out after 9 pm we got a good show ha
795	1	you make good points throughout but as an aside the oldtime locals caused a problem  they were the primary ones that opposed the new promenade so they can retain makai side parking on the road so they can hang out by their vehicles  they were a very vocal minority on thisas the park is getting more popular the walkway has to be widened this type of common sense change is common in park planning parks growing ever more popular  their opposition was very self centered
796	1	lol  pseudo random number generator it is a decentralized immutable ledger with some cutting edge tech coded into the algos i will never understand why people like you post answers to something you know nothing about
797	1	maybe read that statement again definitely dont say that about a child
798	1	yep ive woken up to boom shk shk shk pop boooom boom pop kshk kshk shk shk boom its annoying and i cant tell if its fireworks or gunfire then i look out side and see the ugliest piss yellow fireworks ive ever seen
799	1	it is not so much the design as that the lines arent staffed or theyre run poorly  often they have one of the two interisland lines closed entirely or only taking precheck people while the other one has a line doing out to the sidewalk even though both have two bag scanners and a body scanner and metal detector so they can each take both groups at the same time
800	1	i second this i work in the area and stop by for fish at least once a week
801	1	wow colonization mindset still deeply intrenched in youwe just gonna have to agree to disagree you may be too far gone good thing you dont speak on behalf of all hawaiians
802	1	would that i could my friend i actually love my immediate neighbors very much no friendly fire
803	1	agreed  we did the walk through the first time we visited honolulu 4 years ago  well worth it and it does give great insight into the royal family and circumstances surrounding the events of the 1890 is
804	1	too bad it is so difficult to obtain a ccw on the islands
805	1	im just posting what the laws are vs fearmongering stop with the nonsense dogs at the beach is ok as long as youre respectful
806	1	next trip i suggest meat jun spicy pickles and rice

808	1	hey thanks for your response
809	1	she is got waaaaay more baggage than the cult
810	1	youre good as long as it is been made into a sweater but if you wear  that here you might need temperature support animalhttpscmsassetstutspluscomuploadsusers1112posts25209imageanimatebirdslide25gif
811	1	ehhh theyre designed to eject you high enough for a solid inflation plus base jumpers take half inflated openings into the water recreationally he probably sustained injuries from the eject itself
812	1	yes ive read that the quarantine isnt as bad of a process anymore
813	1	there is no playground currently and those luxury condos dont exactly attract families so it is more like use kids and their screams to drive away the homeless in that section of the park  so win for the local kids at ala moana im fine with them spending their own money to upgrade as long as the use isnt restricted and there are no ads
814	1	with a gun i wish you can open carry a machete for utility purposes though so thats nice
815	1	yep ive decided to rent a car and visit them on my own thanks for clarifying the difference between the two for me haha
816	1	this is a fair argument against it but your initial argument wasnt about this though  you were arguing that this project will make the area appear nicer mostly for the benefit of the high rise condos and eventually the area will be too nice for locals to feel comfortable and i disagree i think local families will enjoy this park project as much as anybody
817	1	did you mean to reply elsewhere in the thread or maybe make a toplevel comment
818	1	hes the guy that can afford 400 tickets
819	1	wasnt mommy but aunt  and yeah i probably shouldnt have called her a bitch just because she was acting like one  i thought it was telling that when she told the kids dad that i yelled at him i didnt he did not say or do anything
820	1	alright
821	1	civil beat really has done a ton for transparency  it is funny when you hear the libertarian crowd who are always accusing the democratic majority of being the reason for all corruption hate on them  i cant think of a crowd more likely to benefit from civil beat is numerous lawsuits
822	1	ive got a pretty good idea somewhere around 2025 japanese about 18 white 13 filipino 10 chinese 8 native hawaiian 5 hispanic 15 hapa im not sure if you have a point
823	1	will definitely have to try that have a ton of star fruit coming in out back
824	1	that is what people who dont know anything about the crypto say educate yourself

830	1	id love to shit on your personal playlist
831	1	way to fuck that up
832	1	i can see that youve put some thought into this and i respect that but i think youre missing my point a bit  all governments should represent the interests of all the people within their borders  no one i know would give up their us citizenship and none of them want to leave hawaii  would we have two separate bodies of citizens living on the islands side by side but governed by different governments  because thats absurd from the concept of what a representative government is  my point is that if you feel that the current state government doesnt represent everyone then gaining independence from the us wont change it unless your intention is to basically disenfranchise or deport a portion of the local people in order to more represent others  assuming everyone here magically decided they were okay giving up their us citizenship which again i find to be a negligible possibility im also just not seeing what benefit would be gained by all people living here from leaving the us other than control over immigration which i think wouldnt even work because wed be pressured into accepting immigration as part of our new trade deals we would have to make which would not be in our favor since we have almost no exports compared to our imports whatever happened in the past is good to know about but any attempt to recreate a former government just for the sake of trying to rewind history is completely misguided and misunderstands the entire concept of government  the present situation is what truly matters when considering a government  hawaiis current problems are caused by the fact that were on an island in the middle of the pacific ocean theyre not caused by our status as a state
833	1	jesus christ what a fucking idiot
834	1	wtf man your comments are exhausting
835	1	then i would cherish you  aloha
836	1	i would have worded it like thisgt how come people like watch jason momoa making shishi on top some other guy then again i wouldnt have made a joke like that because i know my audience and i know that no matter how it could have been worded it wouldnt have been as funnytherefore i like to stick with either posting relatable gifsmemes or quoting something directly from the video cuz cangt all pau
837	1	lots of dogs ok rentals are scams you should contact some property managers for legit dog ok listings but big dogs are not easy any dog over 50lbs is going to be a serious challenge  my neighbors charge  500 over market cause they allow large dogs and they get it and it is a 500 sq ft rental
838	1	edit nevermind saw further down that you made an honest mistake i dont want to beat a dead horse
839	1	nope it was a bluff sanford dole indicated to sam parker the queen is top cabinet member that the uss boston is captain wiltse would use force if the queen didnt abdicate wiltse was unaware of this and had actually ordered his troops to remain neutral when they were approached by one of the committee of safety members to protect them he was told no it wasnt until later that wiltse and the us government found out what had been threatened in their names the us government under president cleveland actually ordered the provisional government to reinstate the queen but they declined and just waited until a different president mckinley was in office under mckinley the us had a war in the philipines and now was willing to take hawaii due to it is advantageous location for the war
840	1	well youre right not manybut still im a sucker for the love story part
841	1	there are still plenty of resources if we used more of the old sugarcane land to grow corn for consumption here instead of seed stock for the mainland and ate a mexicanstyle diet it would be more than enough
842	1	only thing funnier is if they wore a red hat there
843	1	some locals would be hard to understand but calling in to local radio station to complain publicly is pretty douche
844	1	yeah you are an idiot if you cant see the satire in many of my posts even the recent one to neoliberalgt im sorry refresh my memory again because the link you gave doesnt connect with any of my comments on redditits not about your comments it is a about what is happening now watch the end of it if you can stomach it 2ndamendment rights against tyranny
845	1	respectful youre telling people about laws that are simply not enforced and portraying hawaii as an antidog place nonsense
846	1	well im not against waiting but if there was any way i could get a bird and be able to successfully and correctly and not like cruelly i would also i was looking at a cockatiel because my local pet shop just got one like 2 weeks ago and its really pretty and doesnt schreech like crazy
847	1	dont forget the lowered nissans and the beefed up fore runners
848	1	theres a different fruit called star apple this is just star fruit i tried to find a link describing star apple hope this helps star applehttpsdengardencomgardeningtropicaltasteofhawaiitheshinystarapple
849	1	yep i could spend days researching hawaiian mythology for a single name and if the book had anything to do with hawaiian mythology i would but that would be appropriation this is literally just a name
850	1	weird ive never seen any that are mostly greenish when ripe  they mention the purple ones as if those are some uncommon variety those are all ive ever seen  the one in my yard is no good if it is got more than just a little green still on it
851	1	pupukea is correct ill probably ship a bike out there then thanks
852	1	oh wow thats cool as fuck
853	1	this place has been closed for at least a year
854	1	i should have been more specific and said on oahu my badthanks though
855	1	finals dont start until dec 10 i dont think 3 hours will make or break it
856	1	yeah nice used ones are few and far between whatever you do dont wait to buy a cheap clunker when you get here so many young people do that and then the thing breaks down and youre either pumping more money in to it or then you need to deal with a hunk of junk when youre just trying to explore and enjoy the island you could easily get your money for the bike but i look at it like how much was it worth not having to rent a car and having my own wheels and then deduct that to find my lowest price im willing to sell at
857	1	i  dont get this
858	1	phoenix checking in im sobbing because im so jealous we have a lot of poke places here but they are obviously not as fresh and authentic
859	1	yeah ebay sellers are super stingy about shipping anything to hawaii these days i wouldnt expect to find a seller shipping a scooter either
860	1	poke salad is an actual thing though
861	1	it sounds like youve had some trauma at airports im just talking about clean and modern bathrooms and furniture etc i do agree some of the airports u listed are way worse than hnl i dont mind hnlive only ever been to one hell hole airport and that was manila i literally barely escaped that place for some reason the guard letting people in the airport thought i was a reporter no freaking idea why made me go get a press pass i shit you not bizarre and horrifying i saw another guy lose it after being told to go get some paperwork and get to the end of the 2 hour line i was just in vancouver airport and they have this walk that makes u feel like your in some kind of forest it is not that crazy but they clearly went to a lot of effort
862	1	pregnant ladies are grateful
863	1	ive only considered tokyokyotoosaka  but now that you mentioned hakone   i kinda wanna fit that into the itinerary too now  i always thought we can see mt fuji from the train and that would be good enough but how out of the way is hakone is that a 12 day stay or just a few hours is good enough   how much should i consider visiting the hakone area
864	1	youll have to try a star apple sometime i can totally understand calling this a star apple if you didnt know what a star apple was
865	1	yea again this is the same people who brought the average utility bill but ignored huge issues with that it is pretty data but it is not useful data
866	1	lived there for three years  yep
867	1	ccw is for people with major insecurities dont lump it in with martial arts thanks karate instructor
868	1	noted
869	1	will look into that thanks
870	1	so the islands are impossible to have dogs on
871	1	yeah i couldnt put my finger on why it is bad but it must be the rice also it is literally just a block of tofu with no seasoning they should marinate it or glaze with teri sauce
872	1	that is mad i need to buy some snails then
873	1	i dunno i get better reception at my parents house in mililani than i do on certain parts of i5 through the portland metro area  i think they are balking at the issue of the look and design of the proposed pole and the fact that each pole that is targeted will need to be replaced and redesigned  it is not a flatout no but the input for the progress  they want to see it before they sign off on it  it is prudent let is hope it stays that way
874	1	unfortunately fireworks are really really bad for the environment  they leave metal particles dangerous toxins harmful chemicals and smoke in the air for hours and days which end up in the water some of the toxins never fully decompose or disintegrate but rather hang around in the environment poisoning many small plants and animals and migrate up the food chain
875	1	yeah ive heard hawaiian football is big too even before the alabama qb tua
876	1	there are so many different criteria to consider or ignore it doesnt surprise me at all that different studies would have different results
877	1	you mad hahaha
878	1	damnit i forgot i had to write trump level texas slang unfortunately google doesnt translate to stupid
879	1	youre the guy who snitched on uncle kimo eh
880	1	thanks for the suggestion   i was able to get a reservation at tanaka of tokyo  ive never been crazy for the food there but i think my grandparents will appreciate it because the food is simple and the chefs are entertaining
881	1	it is always rainy in hilo
882	1	ross edgley just did the same thing around the coast of the british isle twin bed that is constantly soaked showertoilet that is cramped leg atrophy salt tongue jellyfish stings skin abrasion etcit is a crazy task
883	1	aw man that is nothin  i remember one year i couldnt see 1μ in front of me
884	1	yeah getting death threats from berniebros gamergaters starting from totalbiscuits time white supremacists and many other may do that to a person it doesnt help when people keep holding up bernie and his ilk up when is really a piece of shithttpsmobiletwittercomange_amenestatus1072466973215350784and i have already listed the fucked shit tulsi garbage has done yet still gets help up with along with other fucked up people like jimmy dore and jordan perterson aka white supremacists apologist but me mentioning that iron fist should be asian gets me death threats yeah i m fucked up
885	1	yeah screw those local restaurantbusiness owners for trying to make a living and turning an area of oahu that is essentially overrun with homeless people 247 into a place people might actually go to visit and enjoy  shame on them
886	1	that is a remarkably good description of hnls bathrooms
887	1	wont a bicycle keep me to within like 20 miles i would like to be able to make it around the island at least once
888	1	yup im up at 1124 listening to my neighbors stupid barbie girl song and m80s getting launched   just for your information an m80 is not a mortar its an arial firework the really big and colorful ones in the past ive had people ask why my neighbors were firing mortars
889	1	you can be filipino and pretend to be hawaiian as well
890	1	just return it any buy it from bbuy or gstopedit buy it now when you get your other smash return the packaged one sealed and get full refund
891	1	every time you open your mouthhttpsiimgurcomu9pmtncgif
892	1	just adjusted lightsaturation with apple photo app
893	1	no it is based on the premise that when there is a violent society like ours a lot more people are going to die when guns are easily available than when they arent one extra example of someone defending themselves with a gun against someone without doesnt make up for 10 extra cases of someone without a gun being killed by someone with one
894	1	meanest place
895	1	94 now
896	1	you have a price
897	1	as a former it guy for a school i believe the current generation is just as bad with computers as the older generation they are just better at taking pictures and finding memes
898	1	right i remember one year there was so much smoke it looked like beijing you couldnt see 100 feet down the street
899	1	ya the marine lab on the end looking over point panic
900	1	buy a ticket
901	1	this guy is an ass he even supports manny from diary of a wimpy kid
902	1	not a hello kitty either braddahmanekinekohttpsenmwikipediaorgwikimanekineko
903	1	were so glad you came to visitso when are you leaving
904	1	thats sick sometimes i set mine up on my lanai for sunset
905	1	i think it is just more or less you already having ill thoughts towards foreigners and noticing it more towards them
906	1	at least people here seem to have done that  it was posted twice on my fb feed and in both thread almost everyone is flipping out and completely misunderstanding it
907	1	you should do research before spouting crap hawaii has the lowest property taxes in the country even after the increases at the current rate it has a minimal effect on people who can afford houses with half the residences on oahu being rentals taxes matter very little because rental rates ebb and flow based on the local job market not purchase prices and taxes the tendency for families to stick together also allows higher rental costs as more family members are able to contribute population is actually decreasing because utilities gas food and other necessities are through the roof yet average hawaii salaries are lower than similar jobs on the mainland everyone is moving where they can find jobs and afford to live
908	1	shit this is exactly where im at have been thinking about moving for a while now just dont know where
909	1	not to mention the fact that the drone pilot would need to apply for both a film permit and a drone flight waiver permit on top of having the faa part 107 certification
910	1	haaaaa what an gatekeeping dumass
911	1	all the down votes youre getting is evidence of the ignorant liberal statist mindset that is far too prevalent in this state and on this sub
912	1	good bot
913	1	youre applying a meme meant for gullible mainstream cult mentality people like yourself i hope you realize that
914	1	she should have never remarried i woulda waited
915	1	they just needed to split themselves into 5 companies that each due less than 14mil in revenue each year revenue not profit which is again stupid
916	1	boto you
917	1	it is not stereotyping  it is just that both things are true
918	1	the problem with this poke in question isnt necessarily the preparation i like poke salad however you can tell it is gross frozen fish because it is so pallid and stringy the reason poke tastes so great here is because the fish is so fresh it not really economically viabke to get fresh ahi in places like virginia unless you are airdroping it from far away you mostly only can get it from high end sushi restaurants
919	1	they wont be living there once the building owners figure out that they can get a much higher rent from a fancy restaurant than a manapua shop
920	1	im almost 60 but i have been using computers since i was 15ish so i guess there is that  no i think theyre young fucking lazy and used to having everything done for them  case in point the guy asking about cigarette prices in another thread
921	1	per person america is still the biggest polluter i think
922	1	you havent been to puna have you  no grass huts but a big part of the area doesnt have any kind of highspeed wired internet only satellite which can be slow and spotty
923	1	ask better questions
924	1	loves 69 it seems
925	1	gt how sheltered do you have to be i cant see how anyone can have trouble understanding any locals even if they add pidgin in every now and thenshe wasnt complaining because she couldnt understand  the this is america line gives the game away she is a racist trump supporter
926	1	so you dont have friends in orchidland up through fern acres cause that is where all the shitty service happens edit yeah op will probably be fine
927	1	this guys pokes
928	1	the united states is better than all three of your counterexamples by far our economy is great and we dont restrict political rights relative to those countries
929	1	awesome info thank you
930	1	this is what i based going to the past two concerts i went to bruno and gnr
931	1	i havent seen lifeguards at other parks which have these and they can get first aid across from the parking area there are a bunch of lifeguard stands for the beach they  dont have lifeguards near all of the beach showers statewide  would seem to also have the same water safety and maintenance concerns cause lifeguards fix plumbing
932	1	it is called grooming

937	1	httpsgyazocomaf1905bc7c964cc15ff0b2df9e699cd2reinforcing the stereotype that there are no decent trump supporters
938	1	i wasnt even aware that this place existed thanks
939	1	it is weird that they opened the time capsule but will save it until next year when they open it hmmm
940	1	coward
941	1	gt oh who are you kidding i have been to nyc many times line cutting is normal at the bus stops and subwaynah youre absolutely right line cutting definitely happens on public transit and in any tourist traps i should reclarify line cutting doesnt happen in most local spots bodegas etc mostly because new yorkers who were either born there or lived there for years know what they wantneedits incredibly easy to spot a tourist in new york just as it is out here especially the slow walkersokay i kind of went off on a tangent here hah
942	1	my friends and i ship beer back and forth all the time via usps flat rate boxes idgaf about the stupid archaic laws around it
943	1	how do you deliver a joke in text based conversation besides periods bold and comas there is not much going on
944	1	really everything on that site looks exactly the same  its the same 5 vegetables stacked in a different way for 5 dishes
945	1	your analogy isnt applicable to this at all however your argument is really no different than mine im not saying anyone needs to have my view at all im on both sides of the fence and reading to see more of both my issue was the comment made to an opposing view as in a response to someone your concern and disgust is misguided dont act all high and mighty you sound no different
946	1	chee
947	1	yep gross i would never wear those jew symbols  ulotuskobra
948	1	neatmote a scientist
949	1	hawaii has some pretty strict regulations on cab rides note that youll probably only get this deal from the hotels as they contract with companies cabbies otherwise are probably going to try to talk you into a flat rate non metered ride
950	1	good on you modern day treasure hunter
951	1	lol that is pretty creepy in any case i dont understand why turo doesnt have this feature it is a deal breaker honestly especially with cars that have no reviews yet
952	1	indeed but how much influence did six federal agents posing as friends to goad him on have on his intent if i recall correctly he was already isolated and struggling with mental health before the sting operation began not saying he shouldnt go to jail for posing a danger to the public but it seems rotten how this was handled
953	1	really huh that is cool same time the parts of texas i saw were the dying parts that were mostly just brown and notquitealive
954	1	oh like haole s s s nahnahnahnahnah jus jokesbrb making furikake popcorn to snack on
955	1	sesame oil
956	1	dont do this then you wont want to be spending your afternoon meeting up with chronics to try and sell off a moped before your flight homeif you do decide on renting a scooter make sure you wear the rental helmet and drive very defensively  we have lots of mopedmotorcycle crashes here
957	1	vowels are the same as in italian if youre familiar with that
958	1	nothese people are seriously complaining about kids getting stickers thats idiotic and calling it idiotic doesnt degrade anything
959	1	and it sounds like youre trying to miss my point entirely you should get a medal for mental gymnastics a gold onegt 60month isnt affordable for most people on oahuyou were the one to drag money into this and you pretty much shot yourself in the foot with that quote hehanyway how about i spell it out in simpler terms more guns is just not the answer
960	1	we had the xerox shooting here already so yeah it can happen sadly
961	1	you can be filipino and pretend to be samoan too seen it personally
962	1	have you ever been to a large concertmusic festival before
963	1	26m year for rail at a maximum has very limited impact on a 2b budget tmt is not a project funded by honolulu property taxes
964	1	only downside is that it didnt give the chute much time to really slow him down before he made impact with the water which is probably what contributed to his injuriesbut yes your reasons are exactly what fighter pilots train for which is amazing because all in mere seconds they have to determine if they can troubleshoot or rectify the problem in the air figure out the safest place to put the bird down if necessary make sure theyre in the correct position to eject because its not like they can just punch out any old time kudos to this guy for doing it right
965	1	my apologies
966	1	im talking about the locals
967	1	there it is thank you weird that ive seen it so many times and i still wrongly remembered the hornsspikeswhatever  they are horizontal not vertical
968	1	bullshit like you enjoy your dogs freaking out because of aerials at midnight on a wednesday it is not a local v haole thing everyone is pissed

973	1	you think the people living in those high rises with private pools bbq places etc while paying 1000 hoas are going to be the ones using that water park its a park thats free for everyone to use kids and families from the ghettos that you are referring to will get to enjoy it just go to ala moana park on a weekend and look  it isnt elitist gentrified families setting up tents for their bbqs there  its local families
974	1	the report quantified worst states for drivers rather than worst drivers  because of commute times road conditions and fuel costs hawaii ranks poorlyin regards to drivers themselves though i think there is a misconception that courteous driving is the same as good driving  good driving is predictablemethodical courteous driving can be very unpredictable
975	1	are you being sarcastic about people not taking their dogs to the parks
976	1	back when i bought used collegelaw school text books on ebayamazon id message the seller and let them know that if they ship media postbook rate the book will ship on the slow boat and take a month or longer to get here  id offer to pay more for first class shipping and warn them that if the book is shipped book rate i will file for a refund after a week or so get a refund and a month later their book will arive and ill be under no obligation to send the book back to them  still some idiots would book rate the text books to hawaii and id get a refund a week later and the book would arrive a month or two later
977	1	i cannot stand these haoles that come here and tell us that we as locals are always wrong  they dont understand this is the reason why we locals are so defensive of our views and culture  they try and take it away and turn our world into theirs  the way theyhaole believe should be taught and viewed  they dont care for us and our culture only for their greed and ideaology
978	1	congrats best teacher i ever had was a student teacher who later became my real english teacher she is still teaching some 25 years later and from what i hear from my friend who teaches at the same school still awesome and still loved by her students ms hirsch you da bomb

985	1	i lived in puna at ainaloa subdivision and have friends houses from keaau to pohiki bay you can get cell coverage thats not spotty in all of developed areas the one off houses in areas that dont have hard wire would advertise a mifi on their air b and b if not dont book it volcano and kau districts have more satellite coveragelike i said without getting to much into the weeds op should be fineif you are really paranoid you can always google the verizon tmobile and atampt cell map coverage on big island
986	1	thanks ollie this is tom tucker
987	1	gtthe kupuna would be down with this they were astronomershow would they even conceive of such a thing  they were navigators

992	1	oh i see i hope that it didnt offend anybody enjoy life in the paradise cheers
993	1	yeah thats old school for you the sea life on the big island sometimes seems like they are on steroids opihi thats fricken huge as half dollar coins fish bigger than on oahu and some of the biggest eels ive seen like fricken sea dragons
994	1	yeah thats what i found i had it in my wishlist and someone got it for me
995	1	is it fun i know its really far from waikiki so im not sure if i should make the trip
996	1	u must not be from hawaii  getting lickens in public is quite normal  now i will not condone the behavior u just described because honestly u could be making it sound a lot worst than it was  but culturally hawaiians are not yet on the no corporal punishment train  but most of us do know the difference between abuse and edification  of course there are bad apples in every walk of life
997	1	your theory is that the without a personal pay incentive lawmakers will just ignore that hundreds of thousands of people are going hungry and suffer no consequences for it  the same things that push the government to resume now would still be the primary factors if the lawmakers werent being paid  once a shutdown becomes extreme enough that it would threaten the financial situation of a congressperson making 174k a large enough portion of the population will be in such a dire situation that pleasing them becomes a electoral necessity  that is why these things usually end with no one really gaining huge concessions  both sides need the government running more than they need a big win because if it isnt theyre risking their offices
998	1	gt
999	1	thanks  good to know

1011	1	bad financial decisions they can afford the payment for now but you will be able to buy them for pennies on the dollar when the next financial downtown comes around
1012	1	the year with the biggest snowfall was 2016 at least according to the article so apparently it was in fact easy to forget
1013	1	i noticed the show they were playing looked like joel osteen but for vegans makes so much sense now lol
1014	1	while i do agree they have the same right to be there i dont think they have the right to live there and treat it like a giant trash can
1015	1	i remember reading somewhere years ago that for the day after new year is so many fireworks had gone off that oahu is air quality had gone from one of the best in the nation to danger levels
1016	1	your user name is so appropriate  haha
1017	1	your comment was fine i was just saying i dont think stupid things like this really make people distrust in science but maybe im wrongand the story says  istudy  im just saying it is not
1018	1	this guy is such a lost cause its pointless to try and bring him on board comments like stop committing crimes then and people are thriving just goes to show how bad its gotten in such a short period of time these individuals deserve our empathy but not the breath we can use to speak to those who are a bit more open minded eventually when the conversation progresses itll be time to reengage these types sad but true
1019	1	and now those shitty parents will think what theyre doing is right because the heisman winners parents did it

1023	1	u obviously did not read a single line i wrote nor do u understand what im trying to say  i said specifically i dont condone what u just described  if it went down exactly as u said i dont think that is right and u were correct in calling the police  i am merely pointing out the fact that ur surprise it happens out in the open  in hawaii it happens in the open  native hawaiians especially do not share the same views as mainland ppl  i also pointed out that abuse does happen and that is wrong and hawaiians know the difference between discipline and straight up abuse  so go ahead and call me an asshole but make sure u at least read correctly what im trying to say
1024	1	gt the kingdom of hawaii was beyond a tribe instead a fully functioning government with citizens and treatiesso were many of the mainland tribes the term is strictly a legal one derived from the history of dealing with native americans
1025	1	to answer some of your questions you can get to palmyra by being a researcher or island caretaker i was the former i stayed on a ship that stopped by to conduct some studies on the surrounding reefs the sharks are gray reef and blacktip reef sharks that are not an issue to people ive never seen corals so healthy i did find a couple of strange crates on the bottom but i know how that ended in and the sea will tell and didnt touch them we had one day to go ashore so the staff showed us crab city or their compost heap the land crabs come out by the thousands when it is time to take out the compost that was way more incredible than i expected apparently the land hermit crab population is limited mostly by the number of shells on the island  unewtongimmick uwozwas udinenpine uanneylani

1073	1	im sorry however that is incredibly dumb thinking there are two different people people whom watch something on the news and say that is unfortunate it is probably not going to be me or someone who see is it and says that is unfortunate that could have been me youre fortunate because you seem to have never been in a situation before therefore you have a false sense of security meanwhile real things are happening to real people and have only gotten worse it is irresponsible to think that where does it make sense that someone working two jobs needs to drop that type of money annually and lose already a small amount of sleep and family time dont be rude
1074	1	because the haoles didnt do a good job the first time  this right here is why i commented the way i did  u dont seem realize that the way u told ur story conveyed racism on ur part  on top of that ur posting ur experience and story of abuse on a post about how this young polynesian man telling u how he was raised  he wasnt telling it in a negative way  yet u connected a story of assault to this young mans story and u pointed how it was committed by some big local guy  u know what haoles did the first time genocide thats what they did  outright killed our ppl with disease and greed continue to tear down the next generation  our ppl survive to this day and are still despite everything the most loving and kind ppl  we dont have the amount of murders and crime present in the mainland  our children are loving to each other and have respect  we dont cheer along a president separating families at the border and tear gassing them  we dont cheer when cops kill unarmed black kids  we dont hypersexualize our young on magazines and tv just to make money  u care about children  do u call the cops on parents who feed their young ones retalin or dont get their children vaccinated do u act when the govt defunds school or takes away healthcare  american culture and politics are just as brutal on ppl and children as that big local man was  all yall seem to think i condone abuse of children  i dont and i dont in all walks of my life   but u accused me of it because u cant think past urself and see how ur actions affect others

1116	1	i totally agree with you but that is not an option for everyone i would love to live with family not everyone has family to rely upon in such a big way though i know me and my other half dont our parents are not in our lives on meth in jail and died home ownership aside just even renting here is very difficult for families and there is no sign of it getting better too many are one paycheck away from ending up on the streets themselves im fortunate we make decent money to live somewhat comfortably as far as bills and food go but it was a struggle to get established in hawaii on our own about in our early 20s we had no one to rely on and the poverty was really hard to climb out of so we ended up at a homeless shelter for some time its really great that others can rely on family but sadly that is not an option for all native hawaiians

1173	1	i almost said it but thought nah cant troll a troll that wont understand the trolling damn i had regular popcorn earlier really wanted some furikake
1174	1	take the time to search the sub find some hawaiian mythology or history books that have been suggested in dozens of other threads find a name you like then ask us if its suitable or if there could be something betteror you could search the dozens of other threads where someone is writing a book and wants to use hawaiian names for either their characters or countriesislandstowns since what youre doing has been done many times before it might make things easier for you
1175	1	does that count the colonial occupying forces
1176	1	wait  doesnt manekineko translate as hello kitty
1177	1	what model doesnt really matter im just curious
1178	1	the queen may have been deposed by sugar interests but it was then kept for us military interests when the islands were not returned to hawaiian sovereignty even after president cleveland had sent a person see if the overthrow was indeed illegalunconstitutionalunjust especially during the spanish war when mckinley became presidentby the way lorrin thurston and sanford dole were american citizens in this day and age it would probably be seen as dual citizenshipampx200b
1179	1	found the fella who cant recognize a joke everyone
1180	1	sure do the hailstones measured over 3 and stripped leaves from everything that had them the bare trees looked like february on the mainland for a few weeks had to drive halfway to kaneohe before trees had leaves again i think my motherinlaw still has a few in her freezer
1181	1	there are showers at the campsite you will need to apply for a permit in advance through dlnr probably want to rent a car as well
1182	1	it is a 3tier system so the hawaii early detection is 2nd tier that is going to employ a lot of people maybe 30 or 40 where are they going to live the way the honolulu governance has planned oahu development sounds like it is just about to fly out of control giant condos for chinese investors on waikiki building an early warning complex up schofield barracks some kind of contractor and military housing development near by jobs education money jem

1188	1	being a conservative or supporting trump can get you ban from this sub but the people on the right are fascists hilarity ensues
1189	1	how come when a white male blows up a school it is terrorism but when an elephant rampages down the street it is justice
1190	1	and that guy is an enormous idiot so that is something  he thinks that he actually won when the court dismissed his case claiming that they accepted all his claims as fact  which is not how it works  the court looks at the arguments and says even assuming all the plaintiff is claims are true is there a reason to go forward and of course the answer was noor at least he thinks everyone listening to him is which is slightly different
1191	1	after the guy kept beating his kid  cowards
1192	1	my goal for all housing costs is 3kmonth as of right now not including food here i have really good credit and solid guarantors if necessary
1193	1	yeah some of their bentos are actually pretty decent as well
1194	1	the thing is that the laws are written in such a way that justification for lethal force is really hard to prove i agree it is better to be tried by 12 then carried by 6 but even if ccw permit were handed out like candy pulling that trigger opens you up to so much liability that you realistically are putting yourself in a ton of danger for jail time or civil suits the idea of stepping into this situation and just shooting this guy dead is a nice fantasy to play out in your head however if you actually did it you would have most likely been charged with a homicide i know someone personally who saved a guys life in philadelphia he was a legal permit holder he came across a guy being beat to death outside of a bar by a group of guys and let off a shot in the air to break it up then brandished it to get them to stop beating him he not only lost his permit but was charged with a felony in the end he never went to jail but had to plea to a serious charge and spent most of his savings on lawyers
1195	1	oh my i didnt realize you island folk were so easily offended
1196	1	i would if it were legal because i have a modicum of respect for the law unlike these goblins lots of nice ccw guns are engineered to sit comfortably on the body
1197	1	i both appreciate your response and have enjoyed finishing my work day by reading this thread
1198	1	lol dis fakking guy
1199	1	paradoxically there is a very good coding bootcamp or at least it used to be
1200	1	yes it is its pretty far from waikiki though would you say its worth the trip also do you have any must see beaches or attractions i have missed thanks a ton
1201	1	i think ticketmaster presale is cheapest place atm

1203	1	anti pc just means they want to call black people lazy
1204	1	there are no pools the article says splash pad   these are sprinklers
1205	1	also why the hawaii stores carry japanese snacks  i wish they would carry some matcha flavored snacks rather than just chocolate ones
1206	1	i second kta fresh
1207	1	thanks
1208	1	ive never been in the actual ocean before just some filthy bay water eith a few fish on the brightside though hawaii must be much safer than i thought if my fears sounded like a 10 year old is
1209	1	hawaiian snails
1210	1	i just went to palmyra in august and it is fascinating to see these images from half a century ago that place has changed drastically
1211	1	yeah i might be down
1212	1	holy fuckmy boyfriend and i went there during the day for a few hours and i thought there was a weird vibenow i know why jack didnt like it there
1213	1	right they thought that the writing portion didnt really determine the students potential score like where was this mindset when i was taking the sats
1214	1	that is a broad assumption when our daughter was born we went over costs and wouldve greatly preferred one of us to stay at home vs daycare but going from a two income household to one was still too much of a significant cut in monthly income even factoring in the cost of expensive daycare
1215	1	same way da kine is predictedjus guess em
1216	1	that is pretty impressive to spend so little i eat healthy as well only meat i eat is chicken and between me and my wife our bill is a least twice your guys literally my berry bill alone is almost 12 your total bill im not joking or being sarcastic every day i eat 200250 grams of fresh berries strawberries blackberries blueberries etc and that alone is a about 3 a day or 90 a month im on maui so maybe things are more expensive
1217	1	yes
1218	1	the bigger problem is seawallsdredging that shift sand to unnatural places but sea level rise certainly doesnt help when sea level rise becomes an actual problem it will multiply the effects of dredging and seawallsampx200b
1219	1	thats not how you use eta
1220	1	would gild
1221	1	what are you eating ramen 212 for groceries is simply not feasible in hawaii unless you are eating the lowest quality food and want to be obese  diabetic within a few years
1222	1	taxes are not the primary cause of the increase in housing costs the selling for 1 million is just pure market dynamics influenced by the high demand for property
1223	1	some is some isnt in the us you are correct a lot comes from fracking globally that is less so lng is a technology that allows the transfer of ng so it becomes a global marketin terms of clean there are multiple ways to call something clean or dirty hydrocarbon extraction is going to be dirty no matter what but i guess the question is if extracting natural gas is a dirty as extracting oil but natural gas is far more abundant cheaper and burns far more cleanly is it not worth considering and a lot of people seem to ask a lot of pointed questions about hydrocarbons but literally none about renewable batteries alone have an enormous cost not just heavy metal extraction in their creation and the fact that they are exceptionally energy inefficient but also the fact there seems to be no plan in place for recycling them same with solar again i am not against these technologies all i know is i walked on maalaea beach two days ago and the black exhaust from the fuel oil plant was blanketing the beach fuel oil is one of the worst pollutants but hey in hawaii we must be ideologically pure and have to have a perfect solution so keep the fuel oil belching black smoke and ban lng
1224	1	oh right good point i forgot that rescue last year where the lava flowed over the guy as he took a selfie and the emergency workers rushed in and pulled him out of the lava and saved his life and then the other one where the guy got engulfed by lava and died screaming in agony but then his encased corpse diverted the lava toward a group of innocent bystanders including girl scouts the children of first responders the children of police and two youth pastors so fast nobody survived tragic stuff and a horrifying illustration that should be part of a mandatory video shown to all tourists
1225	1	everyone is downvoting your shaka an 80yo boto isnt that limp
1226	1	im originally from the northeast too sometimes i think to myself that i miss those cold brisk winter days especially around this time of yearbut then i wake up in the morning to get ready to go to work and its 63 degrees until around 9am and im cold as shitthen i remember i dont in any way miss that shit i get no compassion from my father when i bitch about itlol

1232	1	oh you didnt know that that is the way it works congressmen vote to strip health insurance from their districts but have the best insurance in the country congressmen throw tens of thousands out of work over the holidays but they certainly get paid congressmen rail against communism but their lifetime pension package after 5 years puts any communist country to shame congressmen talk about how the dark teeming hordes are coming toward the border then throw thousands of homeland security and coast guard employees out of work
1233	1	good point and conversely they didnt need the english sign because people in america would never expect this to be a bathroom as we are trained to expect all of our amenities to look like they were built in the 70s and not cleaned since the 90s
1234	1	im no economist but there has to be a way that local food for consumption agriculture can work  the gov offers subsidies for so many things why not that  at least until it gets scaled up  would the scale be big enough if we were growing food for all the islandsand what hidden externalities costs or benefits am i missing that when taking into account could make local ag a net earner  could there be any tourism based on the local ag effort ie people go to napa county not because it is lovely but because of the wineries  could there be tourism because the ag is working on a sustainable model and people would want to come seelearn  anything related to the local ag that fetches a dollar from offisland is a 1  get enough of those together and maybe that shifts the balancethanks for your response  this is an issue near and dear to my heart

1242	1	gtive had items with guaranteed delivery dates then on the day of delivery i get a notice that it is delayed  im then given a 23 day range of when it is now scheduled to arrivebut it is almost always just the day aftergtgtmaybe theyre cracking down on giving out free product by mistakeit must be a ymmv type thing then ever since ive joined prime it seems amazon has always been a day early from the first day in the estimatedguaranteed delivery daterange  although i did move to ewa on oahu before getting prime though so that may have something to do with it          im a bit perplexed by your free product remark could you expound
1243	1	there are so many to choose from
1244	1	gtby disarming people and insisting they become bruce lee to defend themselves youre insisting that the handicapped shouldnt be able to defend themselves none of the handicappeddisabled people i know including myself want to carry a gun not a single one i suspect only a tiny minority would choose to do soi hope you dont think youre speaking on behalf of us
1245	1	lmfaodo people laugh at you this much in real life or just online i have a hard time imagining many people take you seriously no matter how hard you try you remind me of the basementdweller style of white supremacist you know the ones im talking about the laughingstock of white people same shit different color
1246	1	wow lighten up a bit geez
1247	1	gtsince youre handicappeddisabled i would assume that you have more medical bills than the average healthy person making gun ownership even less affordable and feasible for you anyway is that correctare martial arts classes supposed to be any cheaperit sounds like youre advocating banning something because you think not everyone can afford it how does that make any sense
1248	1	i share the two bedroom apartment with a roommate who splits the rent with me i dont have the finances to afford a place by myself and also dont currently have the job security to feel confident in anchoring down to a particular spot

1251	1	the main concern is a concussion
1252	1	there is more to the story than that sorry i dont have a link plus we dont actually know what type of technology and skills the native americans had before contact because after europeans met them 7090 of them died in the next few years causing the collapse of entire civilizations we know they didnt really use metal for anything but kids toys and jewelry but they obviously had some pretty advanced stuff to support cities bigger than anything in europeeuropeans were amazed at how empty the land was when they started exploring but that wasnt the case when they first showed up there were people everywhere they just died from european diseases
1253	1	they say right after that false statement that only 300 get it every year so obviously that doesnt make sense im not sure why the showed that statement because getting a 1600 is much more difficult than getting a 1400
1254	1	if you allow easier guns then this criminal would have had a gun instead of a bat the reason honolulu is the safest major city in america is because there are so few guns
1255	1	a small personal data point for your consideration my monthly expenditure for basic living expenses 3500mo rent 1000sq ft 2 bd2 ba 150 electricity watertrash is included in rent no natural gas appliances  electric stove top 5001000 for groceries depending 100 and up for extra eating outmoviesentertainment  so can be anywhere from 42005000mo but realize i am also in what is considered a luxury condo with a balcony facing ocean front and is a 3min walk to ala moana beach there are certainly more affordable places on the island

1257	1	how often are you eating out and how much of the 430 is just for mealssnacks
1258	1	not op but i would guess probably not dogs even leashed ones are technically prohibited at the vast majority of parks and beaches on oahu you can be fined a hefty amount andor potentially face jail time simply for having a leashed wellbehaved dog in a public park where theyre prohibited shit like this is part of what is driving people to fraudulently claim their pets as service animalshttpswwwkhon2comnewslocalnewsdogcitationpacksheftyfine1050234711httpswwwkhon2comnewsaskhpdwhendodogshavetobeonaleash1025805878

1260	1	employees that are not at work will not get paid
1261	1	no
1262	1	ahh i see your issue lol youre not using ticket master youre using ticket center ive never even heard of the site ticket center before but im guessing theyre some sort of one more degree of separation ticket resale site like stub hub or something if you go on ticket master itself the cost is much lower

1264	1	even california is gonna be jealous of that burn
1265	1	oh no downvotes life is overgtideasthese arent my ideas theyre observations of well established processes of nation building through international law the majority of socalled leaders of the sovereignty movement are opportunists and conartists you will never see these groups acting outside of their own self interests like a nonprofit or social service would you dont have to wait for the us government to grant you sovereignty to help your neighbor improve your local park or volunteer for a homeless shelter right all of them preach to save hawaii after the lands are returned and kingdom money is found never before yeah not holding my breathgtyoure proposed ideas are so different than what the sovereignty leaders push for means your ideas have no backing or wide supportsovereignty is not just about whether to stayorleave it is about self control hawaii was 100 sustainable with a million kanaka precontact how do we leverage modern technology policy making and the internet to get close to full sustainability again if we control our waterways airspace and land use we all benefit how hard is that to comprehend there is a post below this one of aampb selling 40k acres of ag land for guess what food sustainability the state has mandated to be fully electric by 2050 americans who are prohawaii already understand all this and are acting on it these are not fringe concepts why is it so hard for you to comprehendgtuntil you can convince the people that actually want to leave that your ways are better than their ways youll find little real ground to stand on in this debatei dont have to convince any of them because they dont matter to the process they wont lift a finger to any solution short of a government handout just like racist southern states they will benefit from the good intentions of more progressive thinkers and doers they will sit back and wait for others to solve the problem denying it will ever work the entire timegtso far ive spent the last few days discussing your positions with my peers and everyone is giving the same kind of feedback that guy has an interesting take on it but sounds like a dick i wouldnt willingly follow himyou and your friends seem to be suffering from some type of mob mentality you can follow whomever you like im not asking or telling you to follow me you just seem incredibly impressionable to a few loud voices i hope your savior comes sooner than latergtyou keep talking down to the people youre responding to and talking like they know less than you that is not how you win debates or inspire confidenceyoure right i dont know you all i have are the words you type i am not here for karma or friendship i have zero tolerance for misinformation and ignorance about topics i care deeply about i can only deduce from what you say here that your knowledge on this subject is poor you like to use terms like the rest of us and the majority and you people in the most ignorant and offensive way possible i challenge you to counter my information with your own beyond pure conjecture which you are pretty good at you give zero information to back up your position provided none of your own solution and waveoff other opinions as misguided were all equal just dont do crime just live at home like we used to do just be an american because the other ideas are dumb just dont expect the american dream ive never heard of this so it must be wrong seriously you should reread your postsyou will want the last word on this and sit in front of your web browser looking for articles to justify you know something but it is too late youve had every opportunity to have a reasonable conversation with everyone who posted here but immediately start with a dismissive attitude my hope is that you do get all of this in your own time because as a kanaka it is important that everyone work together towards a common goal unfortunately right now though you just sound like a troll

1274	1	definitely have your stuff in order so they can release the dog right away or within a couple days upon arrivalquarantine is four months scratch that i just checked the website and it changed last august to only be a month wow httphdoahawaiigovaiaqsaqsinfoi had a big paragraph here on what is required but it was based off what i had to do for my dog when i moved here a few years ago op go to the link above for all the current information check out the 5 days or less checklist
1275	1	i appreciate your desire to believe i think its intellectually important to not conflate possible with probableanything you can imagine is possible based on quantum fluctuations of our atomic structure it is entirely possible to walk through a wall also depending on which guy youre referring to having your arm almost sliced clean off having your leg and ankle shattered and a ton of glass shrapnel in your body isnt basically uninjured its almost killedagain youre conflating probability with possibility all things being equal its more probable that muslims washed ashore in scandinavia than it is native americans or chinese
1276	1	dont forget the time it takes to get there and the time you have to waste sitting in traffic and in the parking lot trying to get out id rather do something more relaxing and rewarding with what little free time i have

1278	1	sorry im confused on what is so confusing for youobviously the cities with cheap ass housing food transportation and other costs have lower salaries than those cities that have the highest housing food transportation and other costs
1279	1	well let me see if i can find some common ground i dont agree with the administrations position on climate change at all i dont see why we shouldnt be trying to shift towards renewables when theyre so obviously beneficial i think the problem with climate change debates right now is that proposed solutions are too extreme i understand that as of now extreme change is the only solution we have but i just dont think its viable for evidence of that id point to france which just rioted after an increase in gas taxes we cant just flip a switch and go 100 renewable it has to be a gradual process or people will vote againsti dont see any problem with policies subsidizing renewables or taxing carbon emissions considering all the subsidies we already have in place for things like corn which is grown mostly in red states to boot its hypocritical to say we shouldnt
1280	1	no dude 3rd eye blind is the only real music everything else is shitesfor real though i thought they peaked when i was still in high school  20 years ago
1281	1	i didnt exactly do a full primary source review additionally if you reread what i said there is some evidence that native americans found europe it is far from conclusive stop trying to act like im making a full scholarly argument for an official alteration to the established historical record of human expeditions that is simply not the case

1287	1	it is a good point the alert uses the same priority as the often useless amberalerts which a massive number of people i know have disabled due to their frequency and irrelevanceon top of that the alert respected my phone is vibrate function which an even bigger nono people could be missing alerts like this just due to having their phone on silentin terms of precedence i have another app on my phone that tracks my blood sugar level generally it is silent as i keep it on silent but when it pushes a notification the app deems lifethreatening it happens about once a week it maxes out the phone volume and blares a notification regardless of whether or not the phone is on vibrate why that app is allowed to push a notification at full volume but a impending missile alert doesnt is beyond me
1288	1	in my experience they are good about making it up to you if an item doesnt make it by the guaranteed date you have to raise the issue with customer service though
1289	1	youre just salty because your music sucks
1290	1	this is a very good but if you are on the road by 7 you should experience very little traffic even this weekend with billabong going on i left from the makiki area and was up at waimea bay within an hour  going further along the coast later in the day the road was pretty backed up but you still would have to deal with this if you were going from haleiwa to turtle bay not to say that you shouldnt stay at turtle bay but there are other options
1291	1	i think youre taking the general and applying it to the specific too firmly im not saying that there was a massive naval empire in the americas but fact is if one village figured out how to live at sea for an extended period you can put native americans in europe weirder things have happened additionally misunderstanding and underestimation of what some cultures were capable of has been a common theme for the entire history of history itself the polynesians are a great example of that where they inarguably had simpler technology than europeans but were far more capable of ocean travel clear until the 1700s with the chinese fleet yes it was a single emperor is pet project and no the chinese were never a maritime culture but that single fleet proves that it was not due to lack of knowledge but lack of interest when that is the case the chance of a couple people saying screw you guys im going sailing dramatically increases it is entirely possible that another explanation of the stories of strange dudes showing up is correct but i flat out dont think you can dismiss it the europeans took the path they did because they could and they had the tools to do it but you can go all the way from florida to norway and only lose sight of land a couple times and only once be more than 100 miles from shore it is entirely possible for people to have gone along the edge of land and ice shelves to get all the way to europe in a kayak hunting and fishing the full way
1292	1	i dont really measure anything and it is like a dash of this and a dash of that but these are the ingredients for this batch spicy ahi  sesame seed oil shoyu mayonnaise sriracha hawaiian salt and green onions shoyu poke  sesame seed oil shoyu hawaiian salt sweet onions vidallia maui etc and green onionswe just moved so i couldnt find our chopped macadamia nuts no more inamona or the dried limuogo but it was really simple and tasty
1293	1	it doesnt matter this isnt about lickens weve gone over this repeatedly and most 2nd graders know the difference between beating someone in the face and lickensit is shocking to me that people think it is acceptable to beat the smallest most defenseless vulnerable and innocent members of their familiescommunitiesand ftr his reaction would probably be totally different than the hate i received all over this thread thankfully by just the few ignorants just because of the color of my skinwhere i was borni have friends of all varieties and they all view beating children as horrible and completely unacceptable theyre filipino hawaiian portuguese haole popolo and everything else it is not acceptable for the vast majority of the population here for really obvious reasons
1294	1	jobs in hawaii pay less than comparable jobs on the mainlandthats not true for most jobs example are nurses they get paid 60hour here in hawaii but in someplace like south carolina its half that or in places like sf its 80hour because cost of housing there is worse than here  the only thing i would say sucks about here in hawaii is the housing cost for the square footage and the cost of groceries because of the jones act

1297	1	this seems obvious the cost of living is significantly lower in those areas for a reasonwhen people make comparisons theyre not comparing a teacher is salary here with one in bfe texas theyre comparing them to other states and cities with a very similar cost of living to our own
1298	1	aka if you want us to do anything about it you need to do all of the work for us first

1313	1	do you have previous experience caring for birds what youre describing is a potential recipe for disaster as birds are very sensitive to stress and the stress of moving is significant for both people and birds especially if youve only had the bird for a short time and it hasnt had time to form a close  bond with its human caretaker youd be doing yourself and your bird a favor by using this year to really do your research on proper care for birds understanding what causes them stress how birds exhibit stress and any potential health concerns from it birds are sensitive creatures so there is a lot to learn please reconsider this idea and wait until youre settled at your new location
1314	1	good bot
1315	1	our conversation started out with you saying there is actually a small amount of evidence that native americans discovered europe before europeans discovered americathen you presented a story as your evidencethen you chose to insert your own opinion on what those stories meant instead of taking a more reasonably possible optionit is more reasonable that they were subsaharan african than native americanconsidering the previously discussed technological knowhow it is more reasonably possible that they were chinese than native american _
1316	1	this idiot supports abusing children nothing you can do about it
1317	1	you arent wrong
1318	1	i dont wanna throw shade but he is kinda right my man when youre getting a pet youre taking what is essentially a wild animal and caging it in captivity the bird has no choice or control over its surroundings so it is up to you the owner to give it a happy life and youre 100 responsible for its welfare many species of birds are very sensitive to stress and a long overseas flight with the chaos of moving could easily kill it if you dont know what youre doing and even with great care youd be putting it through a very stressful ordeal itd be much more humane for the animal if you first fly and then adopt a bird from wherever youre going so it wont have had to endure the flight youll be all settled and youll have a year to research and learn about them birds are living breathing animals and are very sensitive and high maintenance pets if youre not prepared to deal with the overhead and the care dont get one just because it is pretty

1322	1	i know and have known a lot of disabled people in my life and it is a topic that has come up a number of times irl and in various online communities that are geared towards the disabledi feel pretty fucking confident that the vast majority of disabled people have no desire to own a gun based on the conversations ive had and witnessed over my lifetime sorry you dont like it but the majority dont want guns regardless of whether they live in hawaii or elsewhere

1325	1	the settled civilizations you refer to were inland civilizations who had the logistics and man power to build a boat but lacked the capability or technical knowhow to make oceangoing vesselsclaims that nativeamericans could have sailed to europe is in the same realm of possibility as saying romans could have built the eiffel tower

1334	1	yes no idea what happened after i gave my detailed description directly to the two responding officers including license plate description of perpvictim exact parking spot time etc which if you could read dumbass then you would have seen in another comment i did not stick around afterwards and do not know the people involved so no idea what happened to the child laterit helps if you ask questions if something is unclear instead of acting like a prick

1336	1	if you think im comfortable with those people then youre flat out fucking delusional and quite literally retarded im not the only one that has pointed this out to you in this thread you carry on like a rabid fucking dog foaming at the mouth and are too preoccupied with your delusional bullshit that nobody gives a flying fuck about half the shit you say is incomprehensible i have a couple neighbors that have been abusing meth for decades and you sound exactly like them just rambling nonsense like youre high as fuck and havent really slept for weeks on end while steadily destroying your sanity every step of the waygo outside tomorrow get some fresh air like seriously breathe the fresh air in and out slowly deeply and deliberately let the sun andor the rain hit your skin so you have some sort of positive sensory input to your brain smell the salty air at the beach and look around you go for a quick dip in the sea walk barefoot on the sand listen to the ocean is waves crashing and the birds chirping if youre on drugs then you really should do yourself a favor and lay off em for a while your brain cells are totally fried and youve turned yourself into a raving nutterif this is mental illness then it is gotten to the point where it is serious and if you value your health and wellbeing then you should either seek out a qualified mental health professional get back on your meds ask for an adjustment on them or take a little vacation back at kahi mohala or some other facilityit is not funny anymore it is obvious that there is something actually wrong and i truly hope you decide to get the help you needi hope you have a good night and that you actually get a full night of quality sleep i hope you go outside tomorrow and reflect on whatever is going on and that you decide to make positive changes in your life i sincerely wish you the best of luck

1339	1	op blasts posts everywhere
1340	1	do you have any ideas on what industries might work for that the only one ive been able to think of is technology since there is no export cost and companies can start up relatively cheaply compared to retail or other businesses that require a storefront but not everyone wants to work in tech of course and it doesnt seem to be super popular here
1341	1	i second the below comment about hearing some details about the trip ive always had a weird fascination with that place after reading the book and the sea will tell years agowere you there for some conservation or historical work were there a lot of other people where exactly did you house yourself like are there facilities that are actively maintained or did you have to rough it out in the bush are the sharks really dangerous in the surrounding water there that is like the one thing i really remember from the book lol
1342	1	true there are a lot more factors than just temperature we visited dallas for a professional conference which was held in an arts district near a downtownish area since we had driven perks of living on the mainland where thats actually possible we figured we would try to find a grocery store to pick up a small amount of fresh foods rather than just relying on restaurants to save money while at the conference instead we discovered that there literally werent any grocery stores within a 20 mile radius and didnt want to get lost in an unfamiliar city just to find food so we ended up doing restaurants and snacks we packed with us it really gave me a firsthand experience of the socalled food desert phenomenon im living that again in waikīkī where most food near us is expensive and catered toward tourists but its still way easier to access fresh healthy and reasonably inexpensive for hawaiʻi food here compared to there i appreciate that there are few true food deserts on oʻahu just because population is condensed enough that a grocery store isnt that far away
1343	1	i think youve already got that covered

1352	1	most jobs  nah sure there is some exceptions but teachers lawyers finance industry business in general even service industry all get paid shit compared to the mainland
1353	1	what mainland states are you comparing to california i know teachers in south who make 32k a year here in hawaii the average teacher makes about 45k
1354	1	gt we have the same opportunities and choices as any other racial group living in the islandsrespectfully i dont think this is a valid statement there is extreme classism and bias across many sectors here in general hawaiians are marginalized in comparison to hawaiis white and asians population white privilege exists asian stereotypes exists hawaiian stereotypes exist for a hawaiian getting a job that does not have anything to do with sports entertainment or manual labor is harder its hard to prove but we all know this to be true in some way racial profiling is realfor example the waianae community is a good example of an oppressed group of native hawaiians suffering from lack of adequate healthcare employment and education census data says kanaka from waianae will make half of an average salary from someone in another district something like 17k to 30k unemployment is triple the state average and mortality rate is doubleits hard to believe an entire community is making bad decisions simultaneously all the time it has to be institutional there are extreme biases in our systems that effect these communities deeply a white child from manoa and a hawaiian child from nanakuli unfortunately do not have the same opportunities but i believe we need more of your bootstrappy attitude we cant let these systemic issues keep us from moving forward

1357	1	i thought most of them were intentionally bred into captivity through various breeding programs sea world only stopped breeding orcas in 2016 which was right around the time china decided to start an orcabreeding program last i heard sea world is still breeding other species like various dolphins and belugas
1358	1	yes or a plane or drone only way to get that angle
1359	1	it isnt too uncommon for it to hail somewhere on the island it is happened a handful of times in the past few years seems like hawaii kai to waimanalo gets it most often
1360	1	yes more or less  the distinction is that the mongoose was introduced into hawaii by private sugar cane farmers not the government who didnt even do ten minutes of testing to see the introduced animals would actually help to control the rat population httpswwwairtohawaiicomratcontrolplanhawaiigoesawryhttpswwwairtohawaiicomratcontrolplanhawaiigoesawry
1361	1	you call that a well thought out response long yes addressing bitcoin yes  addressing your total failure at the legislaturewhich is the subject of this threadnot even one word  and rather misinformed on the new law is intent since there is no new lawthe division of financial institutions is simply applying existing law
1362	1	i dont think they do a 6 month quarantine anymore and for several years it hasnt been required at all as long as you do the paperwork and rabies test ahead of time at most the quarantine is 120 days 4 months and they dropped the waiting period after the clear rabies test down to 30 days httphdoahawaiigovaiaqsaqsinfowhen i arrived it was after the office was closed so i had to pick up my cat the next morning but it all went smoothly
1363	1	he is the acting manager of the departments plant quarantine branch is that the best theyve got maybe he should just stick to plants
1364	1	i meant more along the lines of digital products not physical ones like making chips or devices no shipping costs no storefront no physical resources required besides the computers used to make the products but the product itself can be stored hosted anywhere i dont see why the salt air would be a problem but i might be unaware of something
1365	1	people ask you for more details because we all know that your conception of hawaii fitting your lifestyle is based on what youve seen as tourists actually moving here and living here would be eyeopening as to some harsh realities of hawaiithat being said many people move here and are happy here myself included but it requires a certain set of values lifestyle choices sacrifices and reasonable expectations
1366	1	gton the upside it seems like more places are being intentionally pet friendly so maybe the more dogs are exposed to such environments the less of a problem they will be and someday this wont be an issue at allthis is what im hoping happens there are some parts of the us and europe that are very pet friendly and society seems to imposeentice the necessity for good behaviorgtbut when in public spaces where a dog or some other pet would require extensive training to prevent issues it doesnt make sense to allow them unless they have proof of their training as a service dogin the us you cant require proof of their training as a service dog because the ada has established and protected the right for people to personally train their own animals as service animals this is partly due to the sheer expense of professional training  often upwards of 10k outofpocket and partly due to the sometimes manyyearslong wait lists and other obstacles longdistance travel for instance for getting a professionally trained animal among other reasonsso while some orgs may provide a document stating the animal is a trained service dog many other legit trained dogs wont have one and it is against the law to request one since it is contrary to the lawsregulations of the ada there are also  far too many bogus online vendors selling service animal vests and certificates which are pointless and often fraudulentnot all agree with me but i find this to be a feelgood measure that will be insanely difficult to actually enforce and that may have the potential to backfire against those it is trying to protectmy opinion is that there needs to be tighter regulations on requiring animals to be leashed or contained in public regardless of where they are  parksbeachesshopswhatever heavier enforcement of requiring misbehaving animals to immediately vacate the premises this already pertains to legit service animals if they become a nuisance and strengthening fines and legal actions if an animal approachesbothersjumps onetc someone  disabled or not  if it is uninvited unwanted andor the owner fails to control their animal id probably go so far as to consider it a form of assault depending on the circumstances

1378	1	while the articles you posted are fine the language posted with them is not  please express your sentiment in a less violent manner
1379	1	well we do know they didnt have steel draft animals complex machinery anything beyond the most basic of sailing vessels closed decks large scale durable food containers the wheel oceanic navigation skillsi dont think their individual cultures are any less sophisticated or genuinely impressive but theres as much evidence for north american tribes having the ability to sail to europe as there is that they had powered flightgtthey obviously had some pretty advanced stuff to support cities bigger than anything in europewell that doesnt logically follow one doesnt mean the otherpopulations of cities are limited by two factors getting food in and getting poop out civilizations that made massive cities in the americas were able to do so in the absence of cholera and dysenterythe reason they were wiped out relates to the fact that there was no culture of animal husbandry in the new world due to a complete lack of appropriate animals animal husbandryincrease chance of diseases jumping speciesincreased resistance to introduced pathogens their cities were massive because there werent any diseases to cull the population and the civilizations had worked out with some foibles how to maximize the population the land could handle even if they were amazing at city infrastructure that has absolutely nothing to do with being able to build a ship the romans were geniuses at concrete and aqueducts and massive city construction they were absolutely abysmal at sailing the same could be said about the chinese
1380	1	easy all is they gotta do is save up enough first so they can buy as soon as they hop off the plane

1387	1	gtyoure argument is that you want to reopen the plantations let me unpack that statement agribusiness and shipping were big businesses for hawaii because of our climate and location im not advocating for plantations but to reenter markets that hawaii is naturally inclined to benefit from currently there is no incentive to make sugar or pineapple or anything in large quantity because the us can get most produce cheaper from contiguous countries we cannot sell to any country directly and are locked to the needs of the us over our own needs the us says sorry about the sugar and pineapple but you still have tourism and we have to go along same with shipping the jones act denies  us any autonomy on how we move goods in and out of the islandsso no to slave labor yes to increasing new business opportunity through direct control of your product chaingtexcept we are a minority wed be easily outnumbered by the asian and caucasian population vote just as we are nowrace is sub category of citizenship as a citizen of the us every person regardless of race in theory sadly is equal as a citizen of a new hawaiian government you would have similar rights foreign citizens in this example us citizens wouldnt participate in elections everyone who switches to a hawaiian citizenship regardless of race would be allowed to vote and have equal status there is a popular misconception that ethnic hawaiians will have an advantage or power over others this ended with the monarchy hawaiians will be equals among others who believe and pledge allegiance to hawaiigtthis is also very counter to any sovereignty argument ive ever heard i cant speak for all hawaiians but ive spoken to many lawyers sat in conventions and conferences read a ton of international law books and keep up on geopolitical issues close to sovereignty blood quantum and royalty are two factors hawaiians have lost and will likely never regain citizenship is the only way forward from my perspectivebeing hawaiian comes down to advocating for hawaii and protecting our way of life serving no master before ourselves easier said than done but nice to think about

1394	1	i for one think it is great i moved here from among other places a socially liberal but very fiscally conservative state new hampshire in new hampshire there are almost no taxes of any kinds at all this means that nothing ever has funding the library for the city i lived in consisted of nothing more than a few rooms with a pitiful selection on them the university represents one of the worst value public universities in the entire country because students have to pay nearly all of their tuition themselves there is virtually no public transit of any kind and very little assistance for citizens who cant support themselves especially the elderly and the disabled just look at kansas since govornor brownback tore through and demolished what was already a very meager set of public offerings it is great if youre upper middle class or richer but for most people an ignorant liberal statist mindset leads to a vastly higher quality of life
1395	1	theyre specifically designed for swimming including features to keep track of stroke countdistance now that said its for like swimming laps in a pool or calm ocean not really for more intense stuff like waimea rock and is only technically rated for 2m depth so its still kinda dumb to keep it on for that sort of stuff but theres nothing wrong with minor swimming and diving i keep my muuuuuch cheaper but still 1m rated fitness tracker on for some swimming and stuff like washing dishes and its fine dunked it under the tide pools at the aquarium the other day too

1398	1	hey there are quite a few of us that dont like tulsi for various reasons i myself have been pretty vocal about my concerns in the past as a friendly suggestion let is try to watch our language and be careful with hyperbole and themes of violence because many more people out there are less informed and we dont want to appear crazy or hateful because then our message will be avoided   or discounted entirely wouldnt you rather people listen to your points and try to educate themselves on her background political and personal instead of brushing you off

1438	1	i wasnt nobody gets sarcasm without a s tag
1439	1	no they arent all you need to do is look at the crime statistics in other states and other major cities gun violence is through the roof almost every where else hawaii has an advantage of being islands in the middle of the pacific it is harder to sneak guns to hawaii they are tracked on planes or in shipment however if illinois make stricter gun laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals in chicago those criminals can get in cars and but guns in indiana and drive them back you cant get on a plane fly to a progun state and the easily smuggle it back also legal gun owners get their guns stolen all the time on the mainlandhonolulu has very lower gun owner ship and very low gun crimes and you should be grateful for that not have a 2nd amendment circle jerk do you happen to be military or not grow up in hawaii because i have noticed it is the conservative military members or transplants that are pushing hardest for guns
1440	1	the biggest difference between you and me is that i understand that beating a small person in the face is wrong regardless of circumstances and that it is not discipline in any shape or form what i saw was done out of anger if you want to discuss physical discipline  of which i dont agree with but wouldnt report or intervene in any way as  it is not my place then either start a new post or take your comments out of the threadcomment chain i started that is explicitly and exclusively about violence and anger  not disciplinei did none of those things you accuse me of but if it makes you feel better to blame me then by all means do so whatever calms your tits bro

1492	1	no thats a popular misconception the us would likely never leave completely rather broker a deal to remain as a military presence in the pacific their observation of pearl harbor as a stronghold is still relevant a century later the real benefit of maintaining the military industrial complex in the islands is the huge rent check the kingdom would receive for continued use of all occupied landsand if you think about it china has already invaded by way of luxury homes

1496	1	this is not an across the board deportation order the aim is to be able to deport people who have committed crimes  currently if some guy who came to the us from vietnam in 94 raped a 12 year old we couldnt deport him this policy would would make said rapist subject to standard immigration law just like someone who moved here from canada this article seems to be trying to paint a picture of ice agents tracking down arvn veterans and deporting them for being vietnamese i am not a huge fan of our immigration policy or the cheeto in chief for that matter preferring a more new colossus approach to asylum but i draw the line with someone who is a felon convicted of a violent crime if someone fucks up that badly we need the ability to say actually sorry we dont really want you staying at our house anymoreedit am i being downvoted because i dont like trump because i dont like rapists or because i think we should make it easier to immigrate to america i will gladly wallow in your hate

1513	1	all you need to do is look at crime statistics   never mind all the other causes and factors that contribute to a violent society like poverty outsourcing of jobs the drug war infrastructure and social services money going to the military hawaii is unique culture and economic situation etc   your whole argument is based around the ridiculous premise that when someone picks up a gun they instantly have an urge to commit crimes and criminals will all of a sudden become less violent once we start punishing people who actually bother to follow the law

1538	1	that is a fair argument i do not have as much evidence as you would like to support the idea that native americans ended up in europe before the discovery of the americas however i can imagine many many unlikely yet plausible scenarios that could put them there especially since i dont have a precise date for when these people showed up it is altogether possible that they came around when the inuits were coming into greenland additionally the story i read did not suggest they made it back home or even attempted to do so so it is entirely likely that they lacked the skills or tech to reliably make such travels but were merely luckya guy fell out of a plane in ww2 and survived basically uninjured weirder things have been confirmed to have happened

1541	1	no offense but that sounds really batshit insane to me like all my midwestern families who voted for trump because they liked his communication style now they are losing their farms because of tariffs they voted on something unimportant so did you there is nothing more important than maintaining a hospitable planet for humans you dont get that or you would have voted differently thats why you get downvotes
1542	1	the people there were saying that only one state employee knew how to access the time capsule im not sure if that employee knew how to remove the bolts holding the plaque or generally how to access the time capsule also that employee will be retiring at the end of the year so the time capsule committee that is probably the wrong name of the decision makers decided to remove the time capsule before that employee retired so the employee could supervise the removal the time capsule will be opened on the 50th anniversary of the state capitol which i think means the 50th anniversary of the completion of the building or perhaps the first day it was opened  obviously im a really  terrible reporter so if anyone says something different theyre probably correct
1543	1	oh sorry let me explain gentrification to youso gentrification is when a community that currently exists is replaced by a new group of people this happens when the surrounding area is upgraded with new shops and buildings businesses change to meet the needs of new tenants as old ones locals are economically forced out of the area the new locals typically have different lifestyle standards compared to the original locals often creating a feeling of abandonments and resentment the old locals can visit and play in these upgraded communities but are essentially relabeled outsiders moving forward as they are no longer the target demographicyes its your park to play in now but for how long the city has accepted that private companies can backdoor public projects the mayor is now on the hook to play ball with a major developer who is essentially doing his job for him that is how you make a park political dont worry youll figure this all out i really had to start reading more when i was younger to get the nuance of daily life hang in there
1544	1	i agree with everything you saidi could see it being really difficult to come up with rules for what is acceptable in different environments and what isnt though obvious stuff is already pretty well covered by law i think such as a dog biting someone but where would we draw the line between that and what falls within the range of what is generally tolerated and isnt a violation

1553	1	you havent written a single word demonstrating even a trivial understanding of the legislature there is absolutely no reason for me or anyone else to believe that you even read the applicable statute much less that you can find itanyone who wants to change a law knows the absolute most basic thing is to read it first and then second most basic thing is to share with everyone how you want to change it  the fact that youre giving me this research it yourself response is comically transparent that youre completely ignorant  who are you trying to fool here  i was actually willing to help you shepherd a bill through if you just admitted you know nothing but you cant even do thatand to prove that i have more knowledge of the state capitol in my snot than you have in your whole body go back to senate bill 2129 from the 2018 legislative sessionhttpswwwcapitolhawaiigovsession2018billssb2129_pdf you see that bar code at the bottom left of the page it says 20180158 sb smadoc that means it was drafted in 2018 it was the 158th request send to to the senate majority attorney is office sma and it was originally drafted as a senate bill sb  you didnt even know the bar code and the text at the bottom existed on every bill until you read this  i know what the code means

1561	1	at the 200 price point how was the viewing of the show ive never been at a concert at the stadium but can you actually see them on stage or were they just tiny dots and you had to watch on the big jumbo screens  kind of like trying to watch the football players from the upper stadium seats but having to watch the reruns on the camera to know what actually happened
1562	1	but you should be thankful that the pay is at least retro ive been furloughed and we didnt get any retro for that imagine living pay check to pay check in that situation

1565	1	lmao dude you cant even construct a coherent sentence im not going to go back over all of your posts in this thread but the majority are completely littered with errors youre just another example of one of the dumbest people screeching the loudest apparently i love that you keep insulting me though because everytime i giggleguffawlaugh hystericallyetc my dog licks my face and does zoomies so a sincere thank you for the entertainment and happiness my dog says woof ruff wwwwooof too which can be roughly translated to thanks ya little numbnut
1566	1	no absolutely not i posted below downvoted lol that i want to see hawaii become more dogfriendly overall which i think will alleviate a lot of these issues the person upset at seeing dogs in our parks posts in rdogfree and appears to heavily dislike dogs and the people that own them
1567	1	i was asking you a question you seem to sling all sorts of insults but wont receive them in returnim not selling anything and not imposing anything the people i know and care about are nothing like you and have made me feel welcome and appreciated here
1568	1	ive explored leaving hawaii many times and i found that although things like groceries are cheaper the pay sucks unless it was sf or nyc but then again the housing was more expensive the people suck there too for the most part plus if you have kids the housing is off the charts for places that have good schools im just saying that people complain about how bad hawaii is because of the cost of living but hawaii is on par with the rest of the us when it comes to pay vs cost of living particularly housing cost yes you can find cheap places on the mainland but how safe is that neighborhood here in hawaii we have cheap places as well like waianae for example but is it a safe place to move to probably not people are only looking at things from their perspective but if you look at everything as a whole hawaii is not unreasonable in living cost you cant blame anyone but yourself if you have a shitty job or living pay check to paycheck but people love to blame the government for having a shitty cost of living when in reality its their own fault for having a shitty income mic drop
1569	1	we do kind of have legal no cause evictions here actually theyre just called 45 day notice to vacate instead ive had those pulled on me three times now although two of them got rescinded the first time the landlord just decided one day that she wanted her condo back because she didnt like her new roommate the second time the owners of my current condo wanted to give the equity to one of their kids so they decided to sell then changed their mind and then decided a month later to kick us out again because they had a paperwork mix up and thought we were subletting weve tried to get these people to let us sign another 6 month lease but they never did probably because they want the flexibility to fuck with us more not that theyre thinking about how disruptive they are to my life telling us we have to move every thirty seconds of course this all while they raise my rent every six months and never fix anything rant
1570	1	did you actually watch the whole video  his intent couldnt have been more clear

1572	1	the ada says the only animals that qualify for service animal status are dogs and mini horses so cats alpacas whales giraffes lemurs etc do not qualify under any circumstances
1573	1	did they respond to reports of a mentally disturbed soldier by getting him the help he needed no they set up a sting operation to run up their stats and justify their over inflated budgets
1574	1	you obviously cant read not sure why im just now getting your reply but i never said they were enforced and never said anything about us being antidog i very simply stated what the laws are it is personal choice if someone decides to break them and obviously theyre enforced sometimes or there wouldnt be a news article about someone getting caught and having to pay for it and yes sir rolf hawaii is not very dogfriendly compared to many places on the mainland and in some other countries this is evident in the fact those ridiculous laws exist in the first place plenty of people can also attest to the fact that it can be exceedingly difficult to find housing when they have dogs  particularly when there is more than one and when theyre large and with a negative public perception like pitbulls none of that screams dog friendly to me

1582	1	what states have the same cost of living as hawaii parts of california and ny is the only states i can think of with similar cost and the reason they make more there is because their housing cost is higher it shows that on the cnn cost of living calculator

1585	1	on average the drivers are more courteous and safe in hawaii the problem is that ive seen them go contrary to the law  to be courteous causing confusion at best think roundabouts rotariesin the ten years ive been here ive also seen more gridlock and blocked lanes because someone wants to get over so they stop everyone behind them here than anywhere in my thirty years prior to moving hereive also seen a person miss an offramp drive to the onramp of the same exit turn 180 degrees off h1 and go wrong way up the onrampso yeah maybe 9  10 drivers are better here but that 1 10 driver is a fakka

1591	1	because it would effectively legitimize criminal behaviour this move is an endrun on existing laws
1592	1	youre the only person ive ever heard making the assertion that salaries arent lower in hawaii in relation to mainland cities with comparable cost of livingyou could compare seattlehttpswwwpayscalecomresearchuslocationseattlewasalary and honoluluhttpswwwpayscalecomresearchuslocationhonoluluhisalary on payscale for instance which clearly shows both higher salaries on average in seattle and a lower cost of living

1617	1	there is actually a small amount of evidence that native americans discovered europe before europeans discovered america there is stories of strange looking people showing up in northern europe in boats and not speaking any languages known to anyone around one such tale describes two men who wrecked their boat in scandinavia several hundred years before columbus

1628	1	as a fellow cyclist i certainly agree
1629	1	i cant say that i really disagree with anything you said even the last part i just dont like the fact that this guy jumped all over me started calling me names and threatened to ban me because he doesnt think its possible for me to dislike trump dislike his policies want a lower barrier to entry for immigrants and refugees and at the same time feel that atlantic article was misleading
1630	1	i actually slightly downplayed everything but way to go to show that youre an asshole i dont agree with lickens either but punching a young child in the face with a closed fist at fullforce isnt lickens it is assault had this shitexcuse of a human done this to an adult he likely wouldve been arrested for just that  assaultbut way to detract from this person is actions and try to turn the focus on me shows what kind of person you are

1640	1	i feel sorry for every single child in your vicinity you can blame white people all you want for ruining everything about hawaii but you and people like you are the ones inflicting the most damage on the people youre supposed to love and care for
1641	1	no it is absolutely not sharing my same view on discipline because many of those people use physical discipline like you know lickens and  while i dont agree with it i know it is generally accepted practiced hereagain this thread is about physical violence and beating  not lickenssorry it is such a difficult concept hang in there and maybe one day youll get it

1659	1	yay that is so good to hear cant wait for you guys to get to finally meet your little one
1660	1	ok i understand your argument but i think youre conflating a few topics the welfare of the state and local government is a separate problem from recognition and sovereignty regarding native hawaiians for the most part recognition for some hawaiians is to get a special status within the existing us government this would be a nationwithinnation status that some find is enough compensation for the overthrowthe why independence is because the kingdom of hawaii was essentially stolen by american business men backed by the us government a fully functioning country disappeared and many people including myself would love to see that country come back to full operation using your example no one had a choice when the overthrow happened but were forced to cooperate with the new management everyone will now proceed to tell me their thoughts on whether or not the kingdom would have made it into the 21st century save your china arguments 50 years and a few generations later statehood is an affirmation that the us government is doing its job but politically it is a powermove to lock hawaii into full control again why people fight for independence is because this is the alternative timeline and we have to get back to the regular one where selfdetermination existsgt would we have two separate bodies of citizens living on the islands side by side but governed by different governments because thats absurd from the concept of what a representative government isactually this happens all day long if you move to canada you are a us citizen on foreign soil you hold the perks of a us citizen but must also abide by canadian laws canada also has the responsibility to protect its citizens and residence you so not as weird as it sounds there will be a us embassy us related services will be condensed as new services are implemented us citizens living within the country of hawaii would not get the perks of being a hawaiian national it would be on the new government to make some pretty sweet incentives for people to switch citizenshipgt gaining independence from the us wont change it unless your intention is to basically disenfranchise or deport a portion of the local people in order to more represent othersthe intention is selfdetermination standing up a new government would be a mind bending task but if the us were to give even a quarter of the support they give israel on any random day it could happen there would be a point where people would have to decide to stay or move but deportation wouldnt make sense hong kong went through this recentlygt im also just not seeing what benefit would be gained by all people living here from leaving the us other than control over immigration which i think wouldnt even work because wed be pressured into accepting immigration as part of our new trade deals we would have to make which would not be in our favor since we have almost no exports compared to our importsthis is a harder subject to understand but we can look at preoverthrow activity as a sign of what could be reestablished the kingdom was a cornerstone of industry and agriculture with massive labor force these businesses could be reestablished under favorable conditions remember it is the us that soldout hawaii agriculture to cheaper sugar from mexico us trade and the jones act makes it near impossible for hawaii to even compete for market share in current industries again a new government would have the opportunity to work out their own nationtonation trade deals which could be extremely favorable hawaii is brand and status as destination wouldnt change in people is minds so we could still leverage tourism but with better controlsgt any attempt to recreate a former government just for the sake of trying to rewind history is completely misguided and misunderstands the entire concept of governmenti agree with you that some hawaiians would like to go back in time but most just want a system that works in their benefit as a majority rather than a minority in addition im going to say that if a new government would be formed it would not include a monarchy or deal in blood quantum this would be allegiance to a new set of laws the quality and benefits of those laws would definitely have to be better than our current system or it is doathis conversation used to be hard to have because the us government seemed infallible and powerful in such a way that sovereignty seemed like a fantasy but with trump is presidency the us government is completely paralyzed and the country is unhealthy and divided in horrible ways all in two years you and i could run the government better right now with that said starting a new government doesnt seem so radical anymore almost better at this point

1669	1	there are plenty of people on the mainland who eat turkey here is an article comparing turkey to ham on christmashttptimecom3646915christmasturkeyhamdinner which shows that americans consume about as much turkey as ham by weight just because you arent aware of it doesnt mean someone is making something up
1670	1	what specific law is dfi interpreting in a way you believe is wrong post up the section number dfi is interpretation and your interpretation we can all then read the law and decide who is probably correct  my guess is that you havent even read the law and are simply disagreeing with the outcome
1671	1	that is because the mainland stores are operated under the texasbased division but the hawaii stores are operated by the japanese subsidiarythis is also why a lot of the promos advertised onlineon tv arent available in our hawaii stores

1676	1	i may not try it then i like tofu if it is done right but a lot of people dont seem to care for that one at alli havent tried the miso salmon ones yet ill probably try that instead
1677	1	that attitude is for purists if the us were to support a transition that us government would be the most empathetic version weve ever seen it would behoove hawaiians to treat the us as allies moving forward not hostile plus there would be thousands of americans citizens and us businesses that need protection good relations with the us is the only way forward it is unfortunate that most hawaiians dont understand basic international laws or geopolitics which says how much work needs to be done before this is even remotely a reality
1678	1	that is probably quite reasonable and reddish brown is a great description for the color guess ill let my landlord know but given that they shrugged off the previous water damage to the floor i dont think theyll care very much as long as theyre not dangerous id rather not lay out poison baites maybe they can even keep the cockroaches in check for once thanks i really appreciate your help

1687	1	i think where we disagree is the limit were willing to walk a chain of assumptionseach of these assumptions have to my knowledge not a shred of evidence if you have some i would be thrilled to be proven wrong1 native americans independently developed technology to build boats capable of sailing to europe outside of any parallel in history this is a huge one 2 native american seminomadic tribes were able to work out the logistics to build these boats 3 native american tribes then erased all knowledge or trace of this technology leaving no linguistic archeological or cultural evidence4 a couple of individuals in this seminomadic tribe decided to sail east and survived despite all odds polynesians are an example of sail craft that was honed over a thousand years its incumbent for them to know how to sail and how to build boats the chinese treasure fleet was a flex by the most powerful empire in the world no lesser state would have been able to manage the logistics of itno atlantic native tribe has any record of anything regarding boat building all records of first contact say the opposite a birchbark or dugout canoe could not travel from north america to europe it physically cannot there were no inuit in greenland until the 1200s viking sagas record when skraelings immigrated onto the island and started attacking the settlers there crossing the atlantic is not something you can accidentally do without a lot of skill and technology kayaks are not open ocean vessels i feel that youve never been to the north atlantic if you think that two people can hopscotch their way from florida to scandinavia thats something that people can barely do today with buckets of modern technology and hundreds of years of knowhow under their beltboat technology doesnt happen out of thin air and if youre going to make a level headed assertion that its possible for there to have been a couple of guys who sailed to europe its incumbent on you to demonstrate that its even remotely possible otherwise youre making a baseless assertion along the lines of well maybe there was an advanced civilization off the coast of spain that sank in 3 days and 3 nightsi mean yeah maybe there was and maybe ancient aliens drew the nazca lines is it likely no can i dismiss that kind of claim unless theres some hard evidence to back the claim up the idea that people could sail the north atlantic is one that has been examined by historians and archeologists before the overwhelming consensus is that there is absolutely no evidence that it was possible outside of a modern context modern includes vikingsafterwards
1688	1	gtbut you should be thankful that the pay is at least retro ive been furloughed and we didnt get any retro for that imagine living pay check to pay check in that situationmy point was that free vacation makes it sound fun and it is not
1689	1	gtor and hear me out here you could just shoot the guy trying to bash people is heads in instead of trying to get into a disadvantaged brawlwhat if they miss and hit the victim who is already in the process of getting their ass beat gunshot wound and a bashed in head
1690	1	gti dont know what he was doing the first four years of his governorship but im sure he has a new plan for all the people who need affordable housinglast year he signed a bill appropriating 200 million for loans or grants for the development predevelopment construction acquisition preservation and substantial rehabilitation of rental housing units  httpswwwcapitolhawaiigovsession2018billshb2748_cd1_htmhttpswwwcapitolhawaiigovsession2018billshb2748_cd1_htm
1691	1	not really the average rent for a two bedroom in seattle is about 2100 that is about equivalent to honolulu
1692	1	alrighty whateveryou seem to be confused about how lickensspankingswhatever you wanna call it is actually pervasive in muchmost of the world  particularly the rural andor impoverished areas  instead of it being some hawaiiexclusive phenomenon localstransplantseveryone else here including all colors of the rainbow all use corporal punishment the same way they do everywhere else in the world  including the mainland which is not some utopian child care haven that you seem to believe the vast majority of people that use these methods know when it crosses the line as youve already mentioned this incident very very clearly crossed that line had this man just slapped his kid whapped him with his slippahchancla or whatever i would not have called because as ive already mentioned im pretty clearly aware of what is already deemed acceptable here and that would not have raised any alarms for most people here what i saw wasnt that simple id hope that others would step in for the more egregious cases no matter what color of skin someone has or where theyre from maybe if more people had raised their concerns peter boy would still be alive
1693	1	yes and it is not like i dont enjoy a good concert but i think 150 per person is about as much as i want to spend 400 means 800 for myself and my so that is just way too much money that is enough for budget tickets to travel to other places already and id rather do that
1694	1	this is not my experience at all  people are constantly having their things stolen and cars broken into not to mention homes  maybe the violent crime is arguably lower than most of the mainland but theft and breakins are really bad due to the large homeless population
1695	1	whoa long time no talk haha sorry i just saw this now my alt is now genepark lol yes it is hella expensive my place is smaller with a junk view and costs more it is only offset by my salary which is more than what i  couldve ever hoped to earn in hawaii
1696	1	it will be great once assisted suicide becomes more acceptable and people can find less messy ways to shuffle their mortal coil until that day i guess well have to live with misleading gun violence statistics
1697	1	gti found it weird that every major international city ive ever been to has a daiso uniqlo muji hampm and gapomagah i just thought of the last 4 international airports ive been in excluding honolulu and it is sooooo true lol

1700	1	he got a target letter he is about to be indicted and the feds are pretty sure they have something that will stick by staying on the job he puts all the current projects of his office in jeopardy someone will have to clean up the mess later and we will get stuck paying the bill just because of his ego and arrogance
1701	1	i want someone else to have a turn too i didnt realize hed slink away so quickly this time im actually kinda disappointed
1702	1	ghetto fabulous
1703	1	yeah but why would you buy from a reseller with marked up ticket prices if you can buy face value tickets from the original vendor
1704	1	what usquid_fart is trying to say is a candidate with a questionable history will be pressed to answer for it or suffer media scrutiny gabbards intention may be sound but her actions and inactions will be her liabilities if she tries a run thats regardless of what ppl believe her to be
1705	1	im trying to follow you but your comments are starting to contradict your previous statements but here it goesgtso many people are thriving within the system as it currently existsdepends on your definition of thriving according to dbed in 2017 an average salary hovers around 50k with average household at 70k hawaii is poverty line is 13k with a minimum wage job at 10 an hour youre at roughly 20k a year hawaii is average rental price is 1500 a month with mortgages around 2k so you find a cheap studio rental at 1k leaving less than 9k left in your salary for food student loans car payments utility bills gas social life and taxes that is 750 a month not enough then you get roommates a second job live at home if you have one buy a bike or ride the bus how long will it take to get to 50k hawaii is also the highest recipients of federal food stamps in the nation with children and single moms topping the list top three locations waianae puna amp molokaihttpsstatisticalatlascomstatehawaiifoodstampsfigurecountysubdivisionmostfoodstampsthere are plenty of articles about hawaii is high cost of living preventing locals from actually thriving economically this has been covered to death here on reddit the so many people you referred to cant be from hawaii and definitely arent hawaiiangtwe could stop committing crimesthe majority of crime is an act of desperation the exact opposite of thriving when people are pushed to their extremes drug abuse theft and domestic violence are some of the sideeffects hawaiians represent nearly half of the prison population in both hawaii and in arizona this stat alone tells you something is wrong ghettos are an economic prison that people cant simply walk away from for most people who do a crime it is not a lifestyle choice it is normalized in their family and community im not condoning crime but i understand that an economically depressed community will generate negative outcomesgtyeah because thats the only thing people want the people who lead the sovereignty debate dont want the sovereignty ideas youre peddling and that is why it would never happen and thats why i think even discussing the issue is stupid its a fantasy and it takes time and manpower away from actually fixing shitim convinced by this statement that you havent thought this through or dont fundamentally understand what sovereignty means i literally proposed fixing shit you dont need to listen to sai ritte noa kanahele trask even the danners to participate in selfdetermination as i said in my previous comment it is completely possible to achieve the majority of benefits sovereignty provides without leaving the us advocating for sustainable energy and food solutions better healthcare and policy that favors hawaii is needs over the continent are the reasons why you want independence it is not a middlelevel marketing scheme the socalled leaders of the sovereignty debate all subscribe to topdown solutions which require the us government to relinquish control first before positive changes are made at home a bottomup solution is fixing hawaii is problems using the tools that currently exist which is state and city government and the political will of concerned citizens however ineffective they may seem unfortunately the people who lead the sovereignty debate are motivated by selfish reasons mainly personal enrichment via money land or status board members of oha are perfect examples of thisgtthis third class citizen as defined by race crap is bullshit its a class divide not a race divideunless you live in a homogenous society like japan or india race is always a predetermining factor of class but to your argument if race in hawaii is not a factor in status what is economic prosperity is linked to education and status through inherited wealth like a safe home family and health does a child born to a single mother suffering from substance abuse have the same opportunities as a child born to a middleclass family absolutely not the former child will encounter a megaton of obstacles the latter child will never see youll say well dont do drugs mom but maybe it is a coping mechanism to minimize the stress of her underprivileged life as a youth and the cycle continues the definition of firstclass citizen means experiencing comfort with no obstacles and that doesnt apply to many minorities in hawaii especially hawaiians statistics prove thisgtoahu has its problems because of how crowded over developed and economically class divided it isoahu is crowded because of opportunity take a walk around pahoa town and tell me if being landrichcashpoor is working for the good people of puna it is not unless youre a papaya farmer but even then overdevelopment on oahu is the sideeffect of uneven distribution of wealth and opportunity across the state tourism as the main economic driver starts in waikiki and spreads outward south hawaii and north kauai  good luckgtyou think theyd chose different people in a sovereign system no itll still be all the same peoplethis is not how it would work the same people hold office in hawaii because we suffer from lowvoter turn out and lowinformationvoters hawaii is literacy rate and general awareness of issues are subpar which leads to poor choices and ineffective leadership now as ive mentioned in another thread you have to be a citizen of the new government to be a politician no one automatically moves over many prosovereignty leaders are counting on this making themselves the bona fide rulers of their kingdom that is why any form of independence should practice true democracy through elections and not be based on an aristocracygti said we need to work in the system to make things better for the people and not only for the big businesses this is something happening across the country hawaii happens to be one of the few states not fucked by the political far right we have our own issues sure but those issues are addressed by people getting more involvedi have some bad news for you reviewing your opinions your talking points align with rightleaning conservative thinking blaming crime as a personal choice rather than systemic issues zero empathy for people not like you misunderstanding of class versus race and general embrace of a capitalist society i can also see you mean well but your attitude towards people not lockstep with your worldview is disheartening i tend to agree with userdamn_nation that youve aligned yourself with the national agenda of making american better creating trickledown improvements for hawaii rather than a progressive social system that lifts everyone upthis thread started because you say things like people like mepeople like you leaving no room for compromise and dialogue it is divisive and counterproductive to the work that needs to be done amongst kanaka and for the record i am not by your definition a sovereignty activist or indoctrinated by thoughtleaders i took the time to educate myself on the subject and i highly encourage you to do the same im sorry if the information i am peddling is new to you but it is not new by any stretch of the imagination to people who work and study in governance also dont read into this as a reddit fueled takedown i saw this as an opportunity to have a discourse about hawaiian causes regardless of how trivial the article op posted i hope everyone gets something from this including yourself i sure did hiki no
1706	1	yes for the essential workers it sucks overall a government shutdown sucks
1707	1	yep  there is a ton of parking at lcc

1709	1	boys are 17 and 20 and weve carried on same tradition for as long as they can remember now its the only day were all together
1710	1	yeah i think that is more reasonable that youre paying around 375mo for food some people dont eat out at all and others eat out a lot so it helps to specify how much is spent on total food costs instead of groceries since everyone has different habitsare you eating those tofu musubi i havent decided if i want to try them or not since reviews seem to be mixed so far
1711	1	gt i can afford the daycare but why would i not work that is awesome that you can afford it there is no wrong answer regarding work  you just do whateva you like i was just sharing what i did for six months gt how i choose to spend my money is up to meagreed

1716	1	me i never break the law
1717	1	i never called everyone who disagreed with me assholes but there are an awful lot of them commenting here i did call you one because you switched the focus of the thread to everything i did wrong instead of keeping it on the only person in my entire anecdote who did anything wrong  the man that punched his small young child harder than most adults could punch another fullgrown angry adult much of the focus is on my skin color and the fact i wasnt born here instead of having anything to do with the actual story  you also repeatedly implied dishonesty and doubt about my version of events simply because haole so uh yeah of course i think youre an asshole for that ive never doubted anything youve said just because brown so why do you think it is acceptable to do so because whiteyep i know a lot of people that voted for trump every member of my family minus my sister and her husband one auntuncle and one cousin there is a reason i have nothing to do with them and i feel so strongly opposed to their blatant hatred and intolerance that i packed up my shit moved thousands of miles away and no longer speak to a single member of my family including extended family with the exception of my sister i do not tolerate hatred and violence no matter what color skin where they were bornlived or whether the victim is adult or child i practice what i preach and so i cut off all contact with those people  my family  and got the fuck out of there hawaii has been my home for quite a while and it will remain my home gtur only comments to me were insults and simplifications of my views followed by mocking my intelligence to others who agree with uare you not guilty of the same
1718	1	i hope so i think my biggest worry is the fire ants currently i cant hang out anywhere on magic island because there are red ant nests at all the different tables and in the trees so it is not like i can hang out there without getting bites everywherewhat is going to happen to this world class playground when the kids cant crawl around on the ground without getting bitten

1724	1	gtyour argument about but what about handicapped people its weak honestly pushing it isnt helping youyeah because older people and small women dont deserve the ability to defend themselves get over yourself youre being incredibly discriminatory not everyone can physically defeat a 60 200lb attacker and saying they can is literally retarded guns are the only thing that a physically weak person can use against a much stronger aggressor and cone out on top by disarming people and insisting they become bruce lee to defend themselves youre insisting that the handicapped shouldnt be able to defend themselves
1725	1	lol i can tell you that those places freeze their fish when not in ahi season
1726	1	bro calm down
1727	1	gtwithout a central authority that can never be inflated by governmentgovernments control the money supply to keep its value stable among other reasons which is a good thing that is why the dollar hasnt fallen 80 in value over the past year like bitcoin has over 2018gtlike when banks closed their doors and said sorry your money is gonein the unlikely event a bank becomes insolvent fdic insurance exists you can be very sure that your money wont disappear compare that to the countless examples of people is crypto exchange accounts being hacked even with two factor authentication enabled private keys being stolen from their computers exchanges themselves exit scamming for their customers money etc once that happens there is no recourse for recovering funds you definitely cant just call the credit card company sure you could have expensive dedicated offline hardware to store funds but that is hard to spend and there is no way you can expect the average person to jump through that many hoops for something as basic as having money plus if you lose that hardware wallet or it is stolen again absolutely no recourse for recovering fundsgtcrypto currencies like ethereum have a coding language built within themthat has never been used for anything useful and ethereum is been around for a while the most popular thing it is been used for was cryptokittieshttpswwwbbccomnewstechnology42237162 if some crappy obscure microtransactions filled game significantly slowed down the entire ethereum network how is it going to support any amount of useful applicationsso far no one has produced a blockchain solution for anything that is actually more efficient than whatever is currently being used except money laundering anonymously broadcasting every single transaction to every single node is fundamentally vastly less efficient than routing transactions through a central authority so cryptocurrency is one and only niche use will always be when you need to hide something from said central authoritiescrypto enthusiasts talk a big game about the potential uses of cryptocurrency and have for years billions of dollars invested no results
1728	1	fair enough  i was just thinking if he wanted to describe what he wanted in the design there was still a way to do it without the need for a translator or the language barrier getting in the way
1729	1	the planned renovation of the park has been a thing for a few years now but since the rail budget disappeared im guessing funding at that level is off the books for nowcity partnerships with private groups is a great thing when done correctly for example if this was a coalition of concerned developers from around the island to improve park infrastructure then the outcomes are shared no single developer benefitsi just want to address your other comment that people arent able to see the good in this i want upgraded parks like anyone else but im not willing to forfeit my rights as a tax paying member of the community for the needs of a smaller group of people this is where we have to stop thinking only of the immediate benefits but consider the long term ramifications
1730	1	mmm mmm mmmmmmm a dollop here a dollop there a little dollop everywhere

1739	1	that is great but she doesnt mention butler or the science of identity foundation  gabbard grew up with it her husband is a part of it she is on record calling chris butler her guruhttpsyoutube9x4gieanbcet16890  it is not as simple as being biased against hindus which plenty of conservative americans probably are ill grant you the science of identity foundation is a hinduderivative cult of personalityi want to add i dont even know if her association is strong anymore or if it would affect her choices  im no fan of fundamentalists of any stripe be they christian jewish muslim hindu or buddhist  im just pointing out that this will be used against her

1741	1	people need to be aware my boss at my old job lived in multiple countries but the only place she was assaulted was here in hawaii her gut told her not to go down a certain part of the alawai and one night she didnt listen got a fractured skull for it
1742	1	i have physical disabilities and would have a really fucking hard time defending myself if i needed to but i dont live in so much fear and anxiety that people are out to murder me everyday ive never not a single time in my life ever wanted a gun and i will not allow them in my homeyeah it has a lot to do with irrational fear anxiety and deep insecurity
1743	1	thanks
1744	1	the fact alone that gabbard was born in american samoa does not automatically mean she was born as a us national and arguably is therefore not eligible to become president while many people born in american samoa are us nationals and not us citizens some like gabbard are born with one or more of their parents being us citizensand this makes them a us citizen at birth and eligible to become president assuming the other requirements are met

1750	1	gtyoure fortunate because you seem to have never been in a situation before therefore you have a false sense of securitywhat is it with people making such ridiculous assumptions about othersgtmeanwhile real things are happening to real people and have only gotten worsehate to break it to you but hawaii is pretty safe and no things arent getting worse youre just exposed to more crimes via the media which has altered your perception we recently set a record low for crime in hawaii i think it was either last year or the year before
1751	1	im glad you saw some mokuleia tends to be pretty safe even at night if you ever want to go up there to get away from the light pollution im a disabled woman and go out alone at night for things like this and havent ever had any sketchy encounters or anything like that up in that area you may want to check the area out in the daytime if youve never been up that way it is a good place to watch the humpback whales if you go out all the way where the paved road ends there is usually tourists and locals there during the day and sometimes fishermen at night

1767	1	a lot of the rural parts of texas also dont have any form of public transportation outside of school buses some of the rural areas dont even have grocery stores because walmart went on some bullshit campaign to wipe out the small mom and pop grocers by setting up miniwalmarts and then several months or maybe a year later theyd close those down too leaving the town with nowhere to buy groceries locally it happened in one of the rural towns i grew up in people were needing to travel 2030 miles one way to get groceries it is not feasible to walk that far especially in the texas heat and there is no public transportation it is  caused a lot of problems for a lot of peoplein areas like that you just have to have a car unfortunately many of these places are impoverished making car ownership even more difficult but you cant really walk where you need to go when you live in the boonies and your town doesnt have a doctor a pharmacy a grocery store or any kind of job that will lift you out of povertythis poverty lack of public transportation having to rely on unhealthy convenience store food if there is one close enough undereducation and lack of opportunities in general all add to the obesity epidemic

1774	1	brah you are pretty angry huh what did i write that was a lie i am happy to look at any evidence you can link to but i think that in turn you need to look at all the assumptions and accusations you are makinggtyou are being downvoted for lying every analysis or the law trump wants to overturn applies to all immigrants from vietnam during the vietnam era since we didnt had solid diplomatic relations with vietnam during the war or sometime after stop reading fox news or conservative media also stop with the fear mongering why is it always rapist and murderers with you with no actual proofkinda harsh yea you call me a liar and a fear monger and i still dont really know what you find so offensive about what i said but imo the worst part is the whole we tiradegtthis is hawaii the most nonwhite state in the union and we dont put up with your racist president your racist beliefs or your racist liesjust because you are a mod on rhawaii does not make you the gatekeeper for the collective consciousness of our state
1775	1	ive done so much eye rolling lately that i think im finally immune to the headaches lost a couple pounds from hysterical laughter too only thing im missing out on so far is the actual death threats
1776	1	i dont believe any of the things you listed nor would i argue that they are reasonably possible i dont feel that it is genuine to throw in the possibility of people making a difficult journey before you thought they did
1777	1	no i dont think i am acting like a bully by pointing  out the nasty shit people say this is what it looked like from my perspective your argument is stupid and you dont seem like someone that experienced a scary situation and you have a false sense of security phrased as a fact but i have experienced all these horrible things so i know how it really is in the real world ie my own experience is more important and genuine than yours issounds pretty shitty dont you think you actually told her what her experience was according to you despite you knowing very little about her surely you can understand how hurtful and awful it feels especially if you have been a victim of violence to have some stranger speak over you and tell you what their feelingsexperiencesperspective is or should be that is something a lot of victims experience having their own thoughts and feelings diminished by ignorant people that have no clue what someone may have been throughwe have no idea what she has experienced and what drives her views unless we ask her directly and she feels like explaining
1778	1	holy crap what a user name 12 year club
1779	1	i used this sitehttpswwwsavingorginflationinflationphpamount1ampyear1928 and also  this sitehttpswwwdollartimescominflationinflationphpamount1ampyear1928 just to see if they matched
1780	1	i hear good things about maguro brothers but i just cant get past getting hamachi sashimi there
1781	1	not exactly chinese but it had some features more similar to southeast asians than modern native americans exhibit
1782	1	why do you think professional authors take so long to write their novels  they take the time to do their research
1783	1	as if homicidal hairless monkeys will ever learn to play nice the only tech that will fix that is genetic modification and you can bet any attempt to reprogram humans to be more docile will be weaponized as well
1784	1	that is not a really convincing argument for being disarmed at home or anywhere else
1785	1	i dont have to convince you of anything it is obvious that you are not getting a ccw anytime soon i have a feeling you arent mentally stable enough for one anyways so the law is doing its job for me so have fun trying to convince people to give you a gun permit but you just wont get it
1786	1	youre a sheep being led to slaughter and you are angry at the other sheep for pointing this out
1787	1	youre welcome if the ssh page doesnt allow them to post they can message michael kitchens or one of the moderators and theyll post it for them they have requirements about joining the page and sometimes people fall through the cracks a bit so dont hesitate to message someone for help
1788	1	no need to be a grinch its just a photo
1789	1	another reason people dont care to help as much as youd like you have no problem asking us all kinds of personal questions but when we ask similar questions from you you just clam up and give us the vague personal reasons and fits our lifestyle which sounds like more of the romantic notions from someone who has been here for a short vacation once or twice but has absolutely no clue what the realities are
1790	1	711 bentos is way better than those dusty granola bars that people seem to think is good for hiking
1791	1	i am currently using ht is fiber modemrouter i think they are separate devices since the fiber terminates into a box separate from the router but i could be wrong i have an ssd and i am hard wired using cat6
1792	1	sounds like the poi malasadas that kamehameha bakery sellsnow i know what to bring to the big island
1793	1	i hope a mask gets pulled off scooby doo style
1794	1	well you certainly appear to be bonkers but if you think your tactics are effective then i dont know what to say to that it sucks we have people like you on our side because imo youre only making things worse_ツ_also lolololol lol and an extra lol at you receiving death threats
1795	1	or what if a bird flies down and hits your hand and knocks off your aim or what if lighting strikes or if a lightning strike knocks down a plane

1801	1	only once  i see it damn near everyday
1802	1	i partially disagree obviously skill is important but i think communication is equally important especially if it is a unique design  you need to be able to work with the artistif he is going to point to a grateful dead logo on the wall then ya who cares but im guessing it is more personal than that in which case it is very important
1803	1	i burst out laughing at that dollop is such a weird word
1804	1	it is very odd because when i run speed tests to different servers on the west coast and other parts of hawaii my upload speed stays in the 100200 range the download speed simply plummets to any server that is not ht just a bit puzzling
1805	1	he gets to give back and gets lots of free promo  like with the screening for bgch last friday at ward
1806	1	gtwhy arent shitty property owners with cesspools arrested and either jailed if criminal enough or deportedfixed that for you
1807	1	right i forgot about this i usually have people carry over such things and wasnt thinking if op was specifically looking to ship itedit to add also you are limited to 5 litres i think of alcohol above 24 but unlimited below that
1808	1	found the 30yo boomer
1809	1	the fallout from our kickthecandowntheroad approach to the 2008 crisis is just starting to come off the rails and there is usually a bit of lag time between when no need to panic announcements go out to when pensions go belly up etc all bets are off if the us does something stupid like take on china or russia in direct conflict though   what people are experiencing now is rapid inflation but it is more of a frog boiling than a zimbabwe style hyperinflation event that will inevitably happen however as the usd is losing it is reserve currency status and our ability to effectively wage economic warfare on the rest of the world goes with it
1810	1	we have history and constantly bump headswell tilalso would it be different if someone else beat your child in the face and i was the only witness would you want me to call or just leave it alone since it is none of my business when someone else say a nonfamily member did it what if it was a haole that beat your kid in the face should i do something or just walk off what if it was a completely random stranger that did it and i was the only one that could provide a description should i ignore my instinct to offer up what i saw so maybe the perp that beat your child in the face could face consequences or do i just leave it since haoles shouldnt meddle in the affairs of locals what if it landed your child in the hospital and there was an appeal on the news for witnesses to step forward i should ignore it since im white and youre brownplease educate me
1811	1	just in case op thinks this is a joke traffic around north shore can be horrific in the summer and a bicycle or your own two feet will often get you from place to place faster than sitting in the traffic

1817	1	ono cheesesteaks in waikiki used to be great but they closed down several years ago
1818	1	i cant speak towards all the people youve discussed this with ive done my own research for nearly two decades i agree with you its near impossible for america to willingly release one of their greatest assets ever collected it would require a congress and president to be so righteous its practically unamericani would argue to let go of what happened in the past both pre and post overthrow anything that would be created moving forward would require its own set of rules and laws smarter and more thoughtful than anything currently in existencebut what i can say with certainty is whatever independence does come in the future hawaiians will not be able to achieve it alone thats why anyone who speaks about purity blood and mild xenophobia regarding sovereignty are mislead nationalism is the only way hawaii would gain independence again and we need all the help we can get
1819	1	are you saying they were pissed off  well except for that one guy
1820	1	everyone who has studied law or criminology knows stiffer penalties while politically popular for do almost nothing to prevent wrongdoing  given that i dont think stiffer penalties for messing with wildlife will do anything  when is the last time you saw a police officer at magic island  i never do
1821	1	sounds like a peering issue if you get 500mbps to hawaiiantel servers you are getting what you paid for isp advertised speeds are the speeds they promise to deliver to their core network not to every conceivable server on the internetim not familiar with the steam  battlenet servers but id assume theyre on a different isp is network and hawaiiantel is peering with that network is weak and overloaded
1822	1	tamura is but only the waianae store
1823	1	i dont think they can which is one of their big shticks with uberetc  in general uber charges less lower overhead etc but uber can also surge their prices way higher and take advantage during those times  cab companies are rather regulated  their rates are set ahead of time they cant raise them etc
1824	1	yeah if you hear her comments on any giveth day you might agree with what she advocates but if youve been around long enough to follow even a few years of her career all you see is contradictions
1825	1	gt sounds like a shit ton of red tape for no real differencesounds like a terrible excuse to let awful crimes go unaddressed
1826	1	well my friend is in backwoods of virginia i think itd be easier to be filipinopolish here than there but he calls it home
1827	1	yep lots of woeisme in hawaii not sure if people came from places where 50k would make them rich but a significant chunk of young professionals work in markets that are more expensive than or comparable to hawaii there may not be a ton of sixfigure jobs here but they do exist it is also not terribly difficult to find 7590k jobs here
1828	1	as a parent of two little ones  if you can afford to pay pricey then you can probably afford not to work that way you can spend that special time with your newbornthis is probably an unpopular opinion and will get downvoted to the bottom of the ocean
1829	1	down to earth occasionally sells rose water ive bought it from the pearlridge store in the past iirc it was the al wadi brand it is been a few years since ive bought it but call around because there can be quite a bit of variation for their different locationsive also purchased a skin care version from there front the heritage  products brand in a pink spray bottle same storealso that location has occasionally carried pulparindo candy but ive only seen it at that one location and i dont think it is a regular product so i snatch it up when i can
1830	1	thanks
1831	1	and youre an uneducated moron that apparently believes it is okay to continue to tear down the next generation of your own people  your very own families and children  since apparently the haoles didnt do a good enough job the first time
1832	1	yeah im not looking forward to the flight to my office next year but it is still totally worth iti wouldnt want to be renting office space here but software when properly made has a pretty high profit margin and can be done without an office so it might still be feasible i am still getting situated and settled in i just arrived a couple weeks ago but there are some organizations doing software development training so i definitely plan on talking with them to see what can be done to improve the situation
1833	1	lol i know that but not everywhere has lifeguards besides if you wanna experience true hawaii like a local you use shi shi not vinegar
1834	1	went to kyoto about a month ago on a similar deal japan is expensive once you get there super worth it though

1839	1	im always confused as to what she actuallt stands for and believes  woman is more slippery than slime to me  just that gut feeling
1840	1	america still exists hawaiians still exist this is the same strategy that has been used around the world time and time again to go well what about all of our people who moved here after we took over as if somehow they totally should matter in the broader question of undoing injustices in the first place
1841	1	ya you got me there sorry about that bud
1842	1	thank you i forgot to buy tobiko for the spicy ahi but it was still ono
1843	1	thanks for the articleedit 2001 eh the timeline is about what i thought itd be
1844	1	you got it you no longer exist and nothing you say matters off to the void you go goodbye sayonara auf nimmerwiedersehen
1845	1	sometimes a reseller will have cheaper tickets than ticketmaster if the cost is a concern you should definitely shop around dont forget to check for discounts you might have through whatever groups youre part of such as your bank aaa etc i went to see hamilton and it took a lot of work but eventually got great seats but spent 200 less than i would have if i had just bought from ticketmaster
1846	1	lololol oh nowhat was that loud noise maybe a missile is headed your way
1847	1	wat
1848	1	a butch lol
1849	1	fwiw i dont agree with banning you for the posts  youve made so far i dont recall seeing any posts of yours that were racist or even generally supportive of trumphis policies although i may have missed something since i dont read every thread on this subthat said you seem to be conveniently ignoring the fact that these articles including the one you posted from vox mention that this expanding pool of deportable immigrants includes those that committed no crime other than simply being undocumentedi have a problem with that also for anyone that is been here that long but that has committed a crime i dont understand why they need to be deported away from their familiesfriendssocial support systems they can serve their time here like anyone else deporting them will have lasting effects on their families as well as the criminal and will only contribute to additional problems in the end weve ruined enough lives let our justice system handle italso fuck trump and his reinterpretations of these kinds of agreements
1850	1	it is all in the delivery
1851	1	im wondering if you are the one who is mentally unstable and cant own a gun and therefore dont want anyone else to have one either
1852	1	that depends on the individual and where theyre located maybe in hawaii where you can go to the beach and enjoy fun in the sun in the dc area its cold and dark not a whole lot to do other than eat and watch tv
1853	1	it is not that you cant successfully fly with them it is that it is putting them in a very stressful position for prolonged periods of time when you include the stress of packingcleaningflyingunpackinggetting situated and comfortable in your new homeim glad youve had experience with birds but i dont really understand why you would subject one to all of that when you could just wait a year and buy one when youre settled it doesnt seem fair to the bird what kind of bird are you looking to get
1854	1	totally agree  lots of signs in english and helpful people  the only thing we did a tour for was hakonemt fuji because there is not really a train to take and it is sort of rural  but day trips like that are easy to sign up for once youre there
1855	1	well i did xpost it there but this forum has like 10x the audience and hopefully any hapless visitors will find this key information in one place or the othergtscott caans performance in hawaii 50he is fantastic obviously
1856	1	it is not about the guy himself as much as it is about the system that condoned the behavior we like to pretend we left this sort of thing back in the stone age but it still goes on today
1857	1	i dunno man them bathrooms at whole foods are okay and they pump the music in there louder than they do in the store  rock out to your poops  i have been drinking

1863	1	70k is plenty enough to get by on
1864	1	gtfrance were frenchi died lolampx200bgtuae we herded camels 30 years ago but now have a series of amazing modern city in the desert including the tallest building in the world created millions of jobs created water out of the ocean and an incredible standard of livingthey also have a notoriously horrible human rights reputation lots of the jobs they created are for lowwage asian workers that are treated like slaves i commented to my friend who lives in abu dhabi that there seemed to be so many buildings that looked ready for demolition and he informed me that those rundown buildings are where the lowwage workers are housed they can go months without getting paid if at all often have their passports taken so they cant flee any abuse theyre dealing with and women domestic helpers are often raped by their emirati employeesmost people i met who love the uae are westerners who are there on vacation or wellpaid people from other parts of the world that are the ones employing the lowwage workers  personally i was not impressed with any of it when i went all flash and no substance everything is for show in order to trick the world into believing theyre modernminded people this is a country where a woman can be arrested for being raped because their laws consider it unlawful sex but look an indoor ski resort see all the pretty shiny   rolls eyes ampx200bampx200bampx200b
1865	1	wife works for a national insurance company with an office in  honolulu and says the majority of claims in hawaii are from parking lots whereas on the mainland california florida most were from freeways
1866	1	im not saying there arent tourists that would be dumb enough to do this because im sure there are but it is quite common for radio stations to use fake caller recordings and present them as if they were real callers i dont know if the specific station in question does that but most do
1867	1	first of all good for you second thats  your field whatever it may be not all salaries on an average i believe there are quite a bit of jobs that pay better in the mainland and people who work in those fields it makes sense to move like musicians and actors for example  but im talking about a median of all jobs not just a few the op never mentioned what their job was third why are you even here then lol
1868	1	im gonna go ahead and upvote this because i am dying laughing over here
1869	1	that needs to be bigger
1870	1	you are looking for a presumably meaningful name but now youre saying it is just a name i am surprised to hear that as a writer you changed your belief about names from your op to this comment and dont seem to believe names can be significant anymorealso what youre describing is simply doing research for your work paid or not writing even a short story can take absurd amounts of time in just research to get it right which im sure you know you acknowledge that it is an understandably massive subject area as it should be with most cultures and their historiesstories but dont want to put the work in yourself you want it to be respectful of the culture and all but dont want to actually make the effort yourself it seems so do you just want us to give you a list of names and call it a day if you can see where im coming from im not surprised at the criticism youre receivingif you dont feel it is worth your time then pick a different way
1871	1	please tell me another use for cryptocurrency
1872	1	this is what i shall call this fruit from now on
1873	1	gt yes but today is america and the group of american expats who were citizens of the kingdom of hawaii that overthrew the monarchy are not remotely the same bodythis isnt even remotely true the america of the overthrow is the america of today
1874	1	foodland poke isnt the same everywhere but like kaneohe foodland is kinda meh kaneohe safeway is better but kailua foodland super good
1875	1	oh yea especially during the summer  when summer break was happening there was less traffic going home  i used to figure out when school was out due to the less traffic  now i cant tell the difference
1876	1	gtfirst off look at the majority of the ads from the time even the cherry picked ads for the article there is not a single hawaiian woman in them ive been to the exhibit there are absolutely ads there with hawaiian women and in most cases they are wearing grass skirts and a bikini top or less the articles characterization of the exhibit is correct even if the limited pictures dont support it no question sex sells and older ads could be very sexist my criticism of the exhibit is that everything is shown in a vacuum theres nothing there to counter the images shown so if you dont know that the imagery is wrong youll learn nothing i guess you could say that spending the rest of the day in the bishop museum is what provides that counter point but if you dont know there is nothing to dispel the myths
1877	1	sick burn
1878	1	gtyour debating kinda sucks because youre just throwing insults aroundthe downvotes only show that the people reading you arent agreeing with your wordsthis isnt a debate i answered some uninformed statements to the best of my knowledge i engaged with you because of your attitude and assumptions case in point you cant actually prove the number of readers who agree or disagree on this thread it is unknowable who are passively reading this is internet 101 stuff still youll use a few upvotes as validation of your opinion sure feel good about thatgtnone the less those are the people who lead the debate on the issue in order to make any progress on the issue youll either have to contend with challenge or sway those peopleyou afford these activists too much power there is no ongoing debate on sovereignty beyond the random facebook activism and the odd convention panel between the jackasses on maunakea and uh hawaiian studies sovereignty is merely a wedge issue and a convenient ploy to hijack attention away from other things as i said people who subscribe to topdown independence are not interested in a bottomup solutiongtbut then where does that leave you they wont follow you people that would rather remain in the us like me wont follow you who do you have then what support base even if youre ideas are goodwithout any support you cant do anything with themyoure really hungup on leaders and followers everything ive discussed here is a means to improve sustainability through local action it can be something as simple as recycling all the way up to advocacy at the legislature you dont need to be indoctrinated into some cultlike following or be fluent in hawaiian you simply need to prioritize hawaii and advocate for her whenever possible here is the important part to remember it is the land that makes the culture not the reverse ethnic hawaiians may one day cease to exist but the islands will still need stewards ive met many locals hawaiian and nonhawaiian who subscribe to protecting hawaii better than the us currently cares to do this is what i mean by thriving generating as much opportunity for all of us to live well here in our homelandi can tell this topic irritates you because of the false narratives it generates about purity righteousness and correcting the past to me different time different people were on the clock and it is up to us to drive the bus i could be a good democrat and phonebank or whatever but i rather invest my energy affecting things in front of me and my community speaking of politics we bitch about trump there is lots to bitch about but hawaii dodged a severe bullet with clinton and the ttp obama and clinton would have given big ag undisputed power over hawaiian lands especially kauai hawaiian is get bent on telescopes while no one raised a single finger to defend against heco selling our energy rights to a florida corporation these hawaiian activists never address these type of issues because one it has zero opportunity for personal gain and two it is too complex for the average intelligenceanyway all i can suggest is to stop talking about these sovereignty leaders and give them no more of your time and attention were all american by default but can choose to be hawaiian at heart that is what i choose to do regardless of some unobtainable political status
1879	1	oh good to know i hadnt done my research since series 3
1880	1	thats not entirely true fish is flow from japan all over the world and it still taste great when it gets to its destinations its handling amp preparation
1881	1	i try to make a joke like that and i get down voted
1882	1	i think youre the one confused people are saying hawaii underpays and im saying their pay is balanced to other states based on cost of living
1883	1	some say the man with a hat is wandering oahu looking for his lost monkey to this daysome say he just found the hat and pretends to be the ghost of paniolo is pastsome say that is hogwash leans back into rocking chair and draws heavily on pipeyup
1884	1	i would almost go so far as to say this is probably the single biggest factor i am a public transit user and walk when it is not worth it to try to catch the bus im able to guarantee that basically 365 days a year give or take a few torrential downpours are going to be more or less safe and reasonably pleasant to walk and take the bus as a primary form of transportation i lived in texas for two years for 23 months it is 100 degrees with low humidity and being outside is a recipe for instant dehydration even if you sip water constantly and chug gatorade when you get home for another 2 months it is near or below freezing and for 4 months it is still on either side of the weather pattern that walking is uncomfortable or requires extra clothing even if it is still possible maintaining the same lifestyle in terms of walking around to get to places was simply not nearly as practical and that is in a relatively mild climate for the mainland i am not the kind of person to take the time to do extra exercise i dont eat super unhealthily or super healthily but pretty average but being in a climate where i can go outdoors nearly any time and take a walk and that i can build walking around into my daily life makes a big difference because im pretty much not going to get exercise if i dont have it built into my life
1885	1	ah gotcha enjoy the show
1886	1	gt
1887	1	gtnone of the handicappeddisabled people i know including myself want to carry a gun not a single one i suspect only a tiny minority would choose to do sogtgti hope you dont think youre speaking on behalf of usahh yes you dont personally know anyone who is vocal about it so let is make sure that it is illegal for everyone because obviously if you or your friends dont like it literally no one else among the near 15 million people in hawaii could possibly have a different opinion that makes perfect sense
1888	1	asking about water safety isnt trolling in and of itself but your questions were so painfully naive that they seemed to either be coming from a 10 year old or one of us just trying to have a laugh the whole are there sharks in waves thing pushed it over the top for me
1889	1	the best i could find was the park shore waikiki for 116 per night for that period using hotelscomhttpshotelscom hmmm that is a bit of a budget buster
1890	1	the major problem there is that the airport was never designed for high security lines  it was designed for scan and xray pass through with little serious attention given  many other airports suffer for this same design flaw
1891	1	all of this
1892	1	were also have a good environment for being outdoors most things you do outdoors are going to involve a good amount of exercise compared to activities indoors were also all poor and being outside is cheaper than a lot of other things activity wise
1893	1	it takes practice but you kinda have to read your audience well i love sarcasm but in general sarcasm isnt appreciated in hawaii and i think part of that carries over to this subit just takes practice knowing your audience and a bit of confidence accept it when the jokes fall flat and just try again next time take a mental note when you see a perfectly executed joke online and you may start to see patterns
1894	1	there is no doubt that any family rich or poor will enjoy a park like the one proposed my original point is about process developers disguised as concerned citizens dangle a carrot in front of the city free park for the rights to build on public land now what youre not catching is this sets up any other developer to do a similar thing with the city and its property howard hughes can offer its own upgrades to the park in exchange for something like rezoning or expedited permitting the public can assume it is getting a park upgrade but somewhere else in town maybe a few homes are being condemned in exchange process matters
1895	1	ok yeah you shouldnt have a problem finding a place thatll rent them to youhave fun and congrats on your marriagehoneymoon
1896	1	it isnt my opinion that those people were naive americans that was the opinion of whoever wrote the articles ive read suggesting it i have no real opinion about it beyond the fact that i believe it is possible and not near as outlandishly unlikely as you suggest
1897	1	research
1898	1	i am totally fine with most of ht is service its probably one of the more stable providers i have ever had this was just an odd issue i was trying figure out
1899	1	that is one of the reasons and i think the originsl reason  when i was living in the area there was always talk of lifting the height restriction in dc because of the housing issue but everyonr went on and on about how they like not having skyscrapers in the city itself because it made it look more provincial and not like an ugly urban landscape  shrug
1900	1	or and hear me out here you could just shoot the guy trying to bash people is heads in instead of trying to get into a disadvantaged brawl going up unarmed versus a guy with a weapon is seriously fucking stupid
1901	1	ok there could be another limiting factor  are you using hawtel is modemrouter device and are you paying for it because i have a story for you  are you doing this hardwired to the modem or via wifi  what type of drive are you downloading to ssd spinning disk
1902	1	i used to listen to doze knows some it is not really about hawaii but hes fromlives on bi
1903	1	fwiw they renamed a shit airport after a corrupt politician who was also an unconvicted rapist because the local prosecutors were too cowardly to take on someone bringing home the pork and corruption
1904	1	so you want other people to do your killing for you and somehow that makes you more brave and civilized
1905	1	naw they likely would have done more with that if that were the case the host sounded awkward and like he wanted to quickly get off the call didnt sound like a preplanned bit at all
1906	1	me personally thankfully never as i have 2 functioning legs and have been able to run away from violent threats gtalso if you dont have money for karate classes how the hell are you going to afford gunsammosafety classesetc60month isnt affordable for most people on oahu
1907	1	nothing wrong with previously frozen most of the poke in hawaii is previously frozen especially when its not in ahi season
1908	1	i didnt realize someone got banned not surprised though we seem to have had an influx of hateful people and runofthemill trolls lately
1909	1	let me get this straight you called one agency and contacted sent one email to two elected officials about something and now youre upset that no change has occurred within a yearyou never actually sat down with anyone formulated a specific idea to support drafted legislation circulated proposed legislation submitted testimony testified in person discussed the issue with the appropriate committee chairs gathered likeminded people to support legislation took the time to address opposing arguments or bothered to understand how the legislative process actually worksdo you even know how to get to the state capitoldo yourself a solid and read this three or four times danny de gracia how to get what you want from the legislaturehttpswwwcivilbeatorg201812dannydegraciahowtogetwhatyouwantfromthelegislature
1910	1	where is rudolphin
1911	1	exact same philosophy as is taught in ccw classes situational awareness and getting the fuck out is the best selfdefense method however times arise when that is not always an option id rather have a gun to defend myself than rely on my being stronger or better trained than my opponents plus martial arts arent a good option for the majority of the population who dont have the time money or physical ability to study matrial arts for the years it takes to get proficient
1912	1	gt for the first time since statehood in 1959 hawaiis population declined for two consecutive years with fewer births more deaths and a greater number of residents moving to the mainlandthis has been an upward trend for a while now and has finally gotten to the point where were seeing a population declinehence my statement why it isnt surprising
1913	1	your emotional overreaction means im not too far off the mark
1914	1	that is absolutely hilarious  good luck with the baby wonder if theyll eventually have a fondness for ranch dressing
1915	1	i think hawaii drivers tend to all follow the same rules as what is courteous like our ability to take turns to properly zipper merge and make it through stop signs also to not be that guy blocking the intersection when the light changes by following the same rules we are predictable to each other mainlanders dont find it so in seattle there was so much bs with driving they think zipper merging is rude and we should all wait in a really long line that goes back 3 exits at a stop sign they will wait for you to pull up stop and then they will wait for you to go even though they have the right of way by far if more than one pull up at the same time they will wait for each other in a long stopgoinchingforward battle and of course they will all block the intersection when the light changes instead of waiting for there to be space on the other side
1916	1	so youre saying they used the correct memeadviceanimal for this post
1917	1	then i think youll be able to see for yourself
1918	1	most rentals on oahu are smallish you might be able to find something that size in mililani aiea makaha one of the less expensive areas of the island or kapolei for 17002300 a month or so though the search i did for that didnt include checking to see if those properties allowed dogs just wanted to give you a general figure be careful looking at listings because people often split a house into multiple rentals and will list the full house size in the sq ft for the listing even though youre only renting part of it
1919	1	good to know in the temporary context of a wellbehaved controlled dog it doesnt bother me either the problem becomes that animals behave unexpectedly sometimes and training them to control their behavior is time consuming and expensive that nice wellbehaved dog might have been perfectly fine that moment but a major problem another moment when their environment changed or they are introduced to something they arent trained for if your dog has never encountered a wheelchair for example you have no idea how theyre going to react to it and the typical person toting their dog around wont think about thati love animals and have nothing against them but when in public spaces where a dog or some other pet would require extensive training to prevent issues it doesnt make sense to allow them unless they have proof of their training as a service dogon the upside it seems like more places are being intentionally pet friendly so maybe the more dogs are exposed to such environments the less of a problem they will be and someday this wont be an issue at all
1920	1	never said they share my views goddamn you really are mentally retarded arent youmaybe you enjoy beating the fuck out of your relativeschildren but the vast vast majority of people here dont agree with it regardless of their skin color or place of birth
1921	1	who do you think you are coming here with all your highfalutin logic and reasoning  this is a safe space for emotional tantrums from people who think the government is there to protect us
1922	1	the media converter is what your fiber is plugged into  you can remove the modemrouter if you only have one computer and plug directly into the media converter  make sure your computer is configured for dhcp
1923	1	worth a shot
1924	1	wait i think youre still confused no one wants neglected parks the problem is the city is not incentivized to fix the park up for the existing community it instead accepts the offer by concerned moms to build a park within a park because it costs them nothing this wouldnt be happening if the parks department actually gave a shit and made ala moana park a priority you can literally buy park equipment online instead the city has found a way to improve public parks while not having to foot the billas others mention whos ultimately responsible for maintenance and upkeep you can say who cares as long as its nice until the people who made it nice decide its no longer your park to enjoy
1925	1	i understand that you want to be inclusive and nondismissive of the varied cultures that existed in precolumbian americas it is two friggen continents of people yo the reason i didnt include them is precisely because they had absolutely no bearing on the conversation so i hope you dont think im implying that the seminomadic cultures that existed on the coasts of the americas is representative of the entire continent and if you did im sorry i expected naively that people who would get involved in this conversation would know enough of about precolumbian america to skip mentioning themin a conversation about french architectural capabilities in the 12th century i wouldnt spend much time on the fact that timbuktu is central government would have been able to get together the manpower to build a gothic church i would hope that people involved in the conversation would already know that while im personally impressed by the capabilities of the subsaharan african empires bringing them up has nothing to contribute to the conversation at hand and they also would still lack the technical know how to perform the task being discussed it is not a dis on their culture why on earth would they be expected to know how to do something they have absolutely no reason to know but bringing them up would certainly undercut any future points due to the fact that it demonstrates that a baseline level of knowledge on the subject matter is lacking so to recap in a conversation about native americans sailing to europe civilizations that didnt live on the coast dont need to be mentioned for presumed obvious reasons that act as a sort of filter to the conversation thank you for roundabout mentioning that cahokiahttpsenwikipediaorgwikicahokia exists because it is badass and not enough people appreciate mississippian culture or even know about it but i didnt think i would need to mention them since cahokia is in illinois and presumed that fact alone would exclude it from the conversation the panoply of cultures that existed in the new world before columbus showed up is literally breath taking im spending so much time on this silly premise because i hate seeing bad history worm its way into people is thinking this is the sort of baseless misuse of history that leads to people getting millions of dollars spent on ancient aliens flat earth and young earth creationism it is abominable science and it rustles my jimmies to no end 3
1926	1	you have no idea hahaive been attracting lots of weirdos lately they usually stop when they realize im either unfazed by their shit or actually find it funny in a pitiful kind of way plus the holidays tend to bring out the selfloathers that like to share their misery with the world
1927	1	ive noticed that some items ordered with prime membership will have guaranteed delivery by as opposed to estimated delivery date        edit i ordered 10 items from amazon this past week that were prime eligible and 9 of them have guaranteed delivery dates
1928	1	i wonder how that would actually taste
1929	1	im not so sure  with accountants designing buildings nowadays not actual architects or engineers someone is going to try  and will have the mentality of well cross that bridge when we get to it  look at the symphony  oh we used the wrong glass  eh it is cheaper just to pay the 2million fine than to replace all the windows with the correct glass  but wait until that glass shatters during high windsincreasing heavy storms due to climate change and the lawsuits from the unit owners start
1930	1	a park in mapunapuna at night   wtf dude  i mean you are probalgy not going to get knifed but still    that is an insane suggestion

1933	1	you sure love your broad generalizations dont youim not native hawaiian and am according to you automatically guilty of war crimes since i simply live in a place that is been part of the us looong before i ever existedplease tell me how youre gonna hold me accountable for such heinous actions i need to know if i should be shaking in my boots right now or if my slippahs will suffice
1934	1	it is not a desire to believe it is leaving room for it in my world view this is easy because the possible travels of people 8001200 years ago dont really play into my day to day life mucheven if it was proven beyond all doubt that 2 native american men purposefully sailed to europe from america it would not have an earthshattering effect on history since it certainly wasnt common wasnt wellknown on either side of the ocean and nothing came of it if there is anything that history can conclusively prove is that a lot of people have figured out how to do things long before anyone really understood how or what they were actually doing were a lot like ants in that way send loads of scouts out to find a way through a poison barrier to food the rest can benefit from the one or two that found a path that worked europeans just had a habit of writing down the scouts that came back it is hard to claim that other cultures that didnt write things down didnt have similar scouts with varying degrees of success
1935	1	33000 gun deaths a year httpsenwikipediaorgwikigun_violence_in_the_united_stateshawaii has one of the lowest deaths by guns in america but if you need a gun to be safe or to compensate then sure carry a dangerous weapon around in one of the safest states in america s

1938	1	different development teams have different ideas of what is important and what the user should have power over the developers of your phone thought the user should have the ultimate power to silence all alerts whereas the app developer thought otherwisei havent read the legislation but i imagine it establishes some standard that phone manufacturers must adhere to for these push alerts to be able to sell their phone
1939	1	you seem to be the only one that had any trouble understanding my comment your assumptions are ridiculous as is your namecalling for your own failure to understand or for bothering to ask for clarificationgood night
1940	1	i should be offended but this post made me hungry instead
1941	1	i wouldnt mind at all if they got rid of most of the us snacks snickersdoritosetc and replaced them with japanese ones insteadand yeah we definitely need more matcha flavored ones too
1942	1	it would be really neat if we had a muji here apartment dwelling in urban honolulu absolutely needs a muji though i would settle for an ikea a trader joe is would be nice too
1943	1	this is with their fiber modem and router i understand that speeds to the mainland will be slower than their advertised rate but i use the honolulu server for steam and i get throttled down to 20 of the advertised speed a friend on spectrum can get his advertised speed to the same server i am just trying to see where i should start troubleshooting the issue
1944	1	oh look another shill
1945	1	happy to help these groups are invaluable resources op i forgot to mention again lol you should have the owners also contact the hawaiian humane society to check if she has been turned in already and to leave their info for the future if she is found and they get ahold of her they will only keep her for a very short time before adopting her out  if she is not chipped i think it is only like 3 days or something like that edit pets with no id are only held for 48 hoursthey also keep photos there so owners can keep an eye out for that too and even post their ownhttpswwwhawaiianhumaneorglostandfoundhttpswwwhawaiianhumaneorgcontactus

1952	1	yeah shame they never got a chance to reconnect but what good is dwelling on all of the regrets in life  just acknowledge how good it was how life turned out and how one adapted and made the most of it  cant go back but you can go forward
1953	1	i go to visit family twice a year mostly for this
1954	1	gt who is them do you mean usare you hawaiian then yes i mean yougtor the current residents of hawaiino too many colonialist movements have been justified with mass migration gtor the descendants of the former citizens of the kingdom of hawaiisounds fair to megtor only people with native hawaiian heritageseems like a good basis in absence of evidence of the formergtor only people with a certain blood quantum of native hawaiianno blood quantagtor just the sovereignty activistsvery much not this
1955	1	not impossible but were not what i would consider dogfriendly dogs even leashed and wellbehaved ones are prohibited in the majority of parks and beaches on oahu you can be fined andor receive jailtime if you disregard these rules and get caughtif you have enough money to buyrent a place with a yard then you should do that few apartmentscondos will allow 2 large dogs in such a small space youve already admitted you cannot physically control your leashed dogs and that your neighbor is terrified of themi suggest finding a better option that is more friendly towards your family is wants and needswhy are you wanting to move to hawaii anyway what kind of work do youyour partner do do you have jobs lined up already youve got a lot more to think about than just average household expenses
1956	1	yep like spam and toyotas
1957	1	someone is got some culture envy
1958	1	where did you find the old aerial photos are they indexed for searching
1959	1	i think this is the ultimate reason driving everywhere sucks more and more nowadays  everyone wants everything now now now is under pressure to deliver everything asap be constantly available but is also spoiled enough to expect the same for themselvesim in the contracting world and the stories i hear make me the most jaded cynical person sometimes  like how there was this speed bump set up on the pali to keep traffic at a cautious pace to help this one pedestrian crossing with no lighted crossing signal  and it worked amazingly well for over 10 years  then someome complained about the noise that was made by vehicles going over the speed bump  and that person rallied other residents to complain about the noise  so much that the city had no choice but to remove the speed bump  and then the complaints from pedestrians came flooding in again  but now due to new guidelines crossing signals need to be ada compliant ie they need to make that beeping noise for the visuallyimpaired and no new protections for pedestrians have been passed because if people didnt like the sound of a car going over a speed bump then they sure as hell arent going to like the sounds from an adacompliant crossing signalit is a shitshow because people are inherently selfish assholes in general  and no i am not necessarily excluding myself from the people grouping  im just saying in general were all getting more and more insufferable and making each other more and more miserable
1960	1	gtif you arent a hawaiian national you are a war criminal for via occupation and you will be held accountablethis is one reason so few people take the sovereignty movements seriously
1961	1	from what i understand  target letter means the federal investogators already have substantial evidence that there was some wrongdoing  a subject letter means the feds just want to investigate further and are asking for your continued cooperation and if you are innocent you still have a chance to clear your namekaneshiro got a target letter  and refuses to step down  says it all really
1962	1	httpiimgurcom4cfwtdhjpghey man hook me up with these 130 field tickets
1963	1	apathy and cynicism aside sovereignty and reinstatement is a complex problem it doesnt happen everyday and wars are fought just on land rights alone other than state and federal land any private land holders would be fine implementing some retroactive kingdom lands reclamation thing would be counter productive to the cause there may be outlier cases but removing land from home owners is not how you win hearts and minds

1967	1	sounds like you got it right then good on ya
1968	1	and the largest of men and women dressed in black in the hawaiian sun
1969	1	honest advice it is all about experience and ability if you dont know what you are doing stick to beaches that have lifeguards and sandy bottoms people get hurt and drown all the time children go in water without issue that would be life threatening to someone with little ocean knowledge and poor swimming ability
1970	1	i hope you have a great time in bangkok for christmas i think the hot summer weather would kill me out there but the yummy food and ease of travel definitely sound enticing are you planning to stay out there to retire or are you eventually wanting to make your way back out here or just doing more of a wait and see approach

1980	1	if trump were to institute something you agreed with would you not support it because you voted against him

1998	1	first of all you seem to be confused  still that this thread is about discipline and lickens which it is not not sure why that is so confusing for you but whatever second  i didnt let him continue to beat his child  he hit twice in rapid succession and the entire ordeal including him screaming for the majority of the interaction before he fullforce punched the kid with a closed fist lasted less than  90 seconds i immediately took action to note the description and then went and got the makemodelplate number of the truck not sure why you think this is some hourlong ordeal or whatever but youre obviously confused refuse to ask for clarification and instead sling shit with your major point of focus on my skin for whatever fucked up reasonnow can you please answer my questions from above so i know when you deem it appropriate enough for me to intercede in the futurealso the fact you think calling the cops is not getting involved is both outrageously hypocritical and against common sense not to mention vigilante justice is frowned upon and never recommendedhad i walked over there and said something i would have been literally putting my life at risk because this man already showed a propensity for extreme violence in public and his victim was already even more vulnerable and helpless than i am if you are as angry as you are that a haole interfered simply by calling the police  which ill remind you are primarily local and extremely wellacquainted with both the laws and the nuances of culture here and are in a much better position to determine what if anything should be done than i am  then i can only imagine how much youd froth at the mouth had i a white person not born here dared to directly interfere by going up to the man and starting shit with them youre a hypocrite and need to pull your head out of your ass
1999	1	or you know he shoots the burglar too
2000	1	as you should just because i support trump doesnt mean i agree with him on everything just that i agreed with his professed stances moreso than i did with hillarys the environment is one area where i break with him which is why i brought up my own position on it
2001	1	brah what are you talking about  right wing talking points how am i supporting his agenda where do you get that i value donald trump is lies over the lives of people in hawaii that i dont have the aloha spirit  that i am spreading lies and reading fox news and what are my racist beliefs and racist lies ampx200bi feel like this is some kind of prank by a friend at work who found out my reddit username
2002	1	no healthcare

2015	1	counterpoint im not sure what it sounded like in this instance but in every mass shooting article i read people think it is fireworks not bullets
2016	1	im trying to explain to you that your understanding of the legislature is so fundamentally lacking that you dont even know you are ignorant and the reason you failed is because of that ignoranceto use an analogy you sound like a baseball coach complaining that a game was rigged but everyone else can clearly see that the reason your team lost was because you dont know the difference between first base and the first inningyou can accuse me of knowing nothing about this situation but it is obvious that you havent even read a single cryptocurrency bill from the 2018 legislative session keeping with the baseball analogy that is as ignorant as not knowing how to swing a baseball bat
2017	1	kona coffee is an excellent example of a high value product that has an international market i heard there is a move to start cacao production here and someone in kuliouou or hk is starting vanilla production these things have an excellent chance of becoming high value boutique items but they are niche luxuries that dont feed people who live here the crux is that things that produce cash dont feed kamaaina and things that feed kamaaina can be made cheaper on the mainland where we import central americans to do all the backbreaking labor without paying them a living wagethis is also an issue that is dear to my heart and i would love to move to a predominantly kalouluuala diet 3
2018	1	i dont see how that last bit is an argument stolen land is stolen land
2019	1	zeng hes one treasure fleet should not be construed as a chinese inclination towards ship building he is the anachronism that proves the rule throughout most of recorded history china was not a maritime culture that one fleet of ships was built one time in 3000 years of their history their hegemonic expansion was through tributary missions where other countries would send representatives to the imperial court because they were impressed by presumed chinese cultural superiorityi feel like you kinda know about things but dont entirely know about them im not trying to put you down but i feel like you are grossly overestimating pretty much everything in your assumptions about the likelihood of a specific eventhow long do you think it takes to drift from north america to scandinaviait would take european ships we can agree they are objectively more advanced than anything that native americans could conceive of a month of sailing to go from new york to london in the 17th century thats during the time when ships were being built specifically to ply the transatlantic passage they were literally designed to do something and it would still take a month to do itnothing in any culture ever discovered in the americas show that they had the ability to deal with a transatlantic crossing could a plastic bottle make it from nyc to england sure would it take several months of drifting absolutely would any native american lacking sails and rudders and anything beyond the most rudimentary boat building technology be able to survive a trip extremely doubtful to the point of disbelief its more likely that the people in the stories you reference belong to a culture group that had hundreds of years of proven maritime prowess knowing nothing other than what you said its more likely that tradersslavers from the maghreb washed up on the beach in your story than an unknown and undocumented native american maritime power existed to send a ship out that crashed in scandinaviaits on the same level of historical likelihood as the stone of scone being israeli or native americans being descended from jews
2020	1	because a lot of people have romantic notions of hawaii but many of those arent capable of actually making it out here  whether they cant find friends a job they dont want to each work multiple jobs to make ends meet or whatever the majority of newcomers leave within a few years we also have the highest per capita rate of homelessness in the entire country some not only cant thrive but blow through their savings that wouldve paid their way back home and they end up stuck out here on a rock in the middle of the ocean it is not like you can just take a cheap bustrain back to where you came from im not the person you responded to but you didnt reply to my comment above so again i ask you what it is about hawaii that makes you want to move here and what do you and your partner do for a living
2021	1	yeah i know lol

2051	1	power wouldnt transfer to the existing system as you describedthe process of reinstatement is creating a constitutional convention of sorts to identity new leaders adopt and change laws that existed prior to the overthrow after a new constitution is created a transitional team would be formed to oversee a citizen drive and election of new leadership this would take the form of a parliamentat this point current residences in hawaii could choose to remain us citizens or change to kingdom citizenship one scenario would be that the current state government starting with ige on down would assist the transitional team in taking control of the daytoday tasks remember you cant force anyone to change their citizenship unwillingly so state leadership would be slowly be phased out ige and anyone in legislation and the judiciary would have to change their status as citizens to participate in the new government i guess deals could be brokered to hold new positions for senior state officials thats beyond me thoughthis process most likely under heavy observation by us officials even a un presence might be warranted would take years to do id say at least a decade to get to some level of standalone governance by the new kingdom or whatever they would want to call themselvesobviously this would have to take place under an extremely compassionate us government that would support such an effort this is the major flaw in most hardcore sovereignty peoples plan they assume a loophole or single ruling from the hague would force the hand of the united states to relinquish power but we all know better that american government isnt reliable or honest for any of this to happen you would need to reform the us government first then lobby hard af to convince legislature to accept and vote on reinstatement of the kingdom not impossible but highly improbableso if any of this makes sense  consider how ineffective current sovereignty activist operate if you want sovereignty you work from the inside of government outward nothings gonna happen in garages and parks
2052	1	gt ive never been so angry in my life that nobody else bothered to dosay somethingbutbut you didnt dosay something either how do you know that the other people didnt all report him too maybe at this very moment they are on some other internet forum complaining about how you didnt do or say somethingninja edit just to be clear i dont think you should punch children in the face
2053	1	now youre just arguing semantics oh it is a valley not a beach oh it is not owned by the county they are beaches that reside in hawaii county they dont have life guards at this point youre just trying to move the goal post also are you trying to tell me that the bishop estates dont reside within hawaii county
2054	1	the giant endless ocean probably helps too many cities along the great lakes have more moderate climates than ones even just a little further away since the lakes dampen the rate of change and the pacific ocean is the greatest lake in the world still doesnt reduce how cool it is to be able to sleep without a blanket on december 30th though even if i kinda miss seasons there is a lot to like about living here
2055	1	no but the many downvotes you have gotten should make you understand how many people in this sub feel also as moderator i have to deal with all the negative stuff that gets brigaded on here and remove both spam posts and hateful speech i am no means perfect but in the last 2 years this subreddit as well as hundreds of other local subreddits have been brigaded by hateful rhetoric of those who support the president followers of the_donald believe trying to brigade smaller subreddits so that they will have more influence and it will be easier to recruit people to their side these are the same tactics as white supremacist organizations brigading reddit facebook twitter and other social media if you actually did a google search on multiple news sites about this story you would see that this attempt at deportation applies to all vietnamese immigrants of that era read views of immigration lawyers and not right wing talk show hosts so far you havent said anything hostile all you have done is spread easily disprovable lies the president has been investigated for conspiracy with russia and saudi arabia russia has been proven to use spies bots and online troll farms to spread lies and to get trump elected i dont know if you are a russian troll or a person from down the street i do know you are spreading lies this is your final warning before you get banned
2056	1	the first is from a conservative christian organization the second solely seems to advocate for corporal punishment which is really a euphemism for beating or abusing a child and the last actually provides evidence against your point from your own source the experts are all in agreement on this fact research shows that spanking does more harm than good
2057	1	sure i didnt mean that statement to be derogatory to tribes eventually all hawaiians were represented by the kingdom which established itself as a new recognized country native american and first nations tribes like our maori cousins had an extra step to reach similar recognition to my knowledge the power of a tribe was locked to geographic area and different than nationality regarding rights im no expert on this stuff tho
2058	1	no you dont understand my point and the fact that i wasnt born here has zero to do with anything at all i was born and raised in areas with similar mentalities towards spankings slapping pinching etc it was considered acceptable where im from in the exact same way that it is here and ive lived here nearly half my life so im pretty aware of what is acceptable and what is notthere is a line sometimes not clearly demarcated that once you cross it becomes clear that the abuse is entirely unacceptable and this is the case that i sawi was not shocked or surprised abuse happens in public  that happened where i was raised and i see it here too  and it is not nearly on the same level as what i saw i was angry at the level of abuse that was out in the open with no one else bothering to act like it was the assault it wasbut you saying things like you must not be from here and now i will not condone the behavior u just described because honestly u could be making it sound a lot worst than it was is flat out bullshit whether you condone the behavior or notyou continue to subtly imply im less than honest with quips like this if it went down exactly as u said i already very clearly stated what i saw twice which is far from it being that of lickens yet you still post your statements that seem to be intended to raise doubt that i know what i really witnessed and that im relaying the story factually
2059	1	well that depends do you look at rthe_donald and sympathize with that kind of content because those are exactly the kind of people those words are referring to and the content there is indeed both deplorable and racist furthermore a significant number of members of this working class are nothing of the sort little surprise the mascot for the altright is a billionaire who made his money defrauding actual working class people by screwing them out of salaries and then dumping or settling the inevitable lawsuitshttpswwwusatodaycomstorynewspoliticselections20160609donaldtrumpunpaidbillsrepublicanpresidentlaswuits85297274 is that something you also sympathize withif not then i dont see why youre taking these words personally these words dont apply to those who treat others with respect even if theyre conservative

2068	1	nobody pulled out their phone walked away from what they were doing or otherwise appeared to be concerned so it seems a safe assumption it also took me a few mins to get in view of his license plate and everyone else just went back to drinkingcelebratingplaying with their kidsetc the cops took a while to get there more than 30 mins and while i was in a separate area at that time waiting for them i still had a pretty complete view of the entire partyarea where the incident occurred and had nothing to do but wait so i continued watching to see if the man attacked his child again it is pretty safe to say that no one else called the cops or gave a damn based on observationedit and yes i most certainly did do something  i did everything i possibly could as a significantly disabled person without putting my own life in danger
2069	1	thanks for the indepth response didnt get to see this over the weekend as i mainly reddit at work lol your response definitely has given me a different idea of what the place is ever since i read the book it is always loomed in my mind as this mysterious like almost hauntedcursed place in the back of my mind like where no humans should tread so much so that i was like if i ever get around to doing that retire and sail around the work thing in like 40 years i wanted to go there just to see it so i guess bugliosi did a pretty good job with his use of artistic liberties p  ill definitely have to check out that other book now
2070	1	damn that sucks too because his name was released the day of the incident one of his cousins claimed he had already turned himself in people need to step up and turn over his location before he kills someone
2071	1	you keep making all sorts of fucked up assumptions about me too so why are you getting offended never once have i claimed my way is better than  anyone else is i am learning all the timeif you think i find it acceptable to gas children or adults to excuse or participate in genocide  voted a literal shitstain into office or whatever other fucked up shit youre trying to pin on me an individual  i dont represent all white people  only myself then youre flat out fucking mistakeni asked for clarification on those examples and yes einstein they arent what happened in the anecdote i gave i asked because culture has a lot of nuance and a few of you keep bleating on and on about how it is different here and i should open my mind and learn but when i ask questions holy shit the defenses are up and i continue to just get told off if you want me to learn then answer the questions i asked otherwise keep your mouth shut you cant have it both waysif you keep hounding someone about all these white people transgressions that they had absolutely nothing to do with then dont be surprised if they turn around and talk shit about all hawaiians that is not something i would do because i know hawaiians tend to be loving and caring and amazing people just recognize that there is an awful lot of hypocrisy going on here and it seems to be coming from only a small handful of people i wonder why that isfeel free to respond im headed out for a while but really would like to have answers to the questions i asked itd be a shame to just be called all those hateful names and constantly told how i just dont get it but not have anyone guide me for the future i assume the answers are different for certain scenarios so please educate me
2072	1	he edited his post  it initally said momoa was samoan i wasnt making a statement about blood quantum
2073	1	gt     or the descendants of the former citizens of the kingdom of hawaiigt sounds fair to meok well in that case hawaiians were still a shrinking minority way more asian migrant workers and caucasian expats at that timegt     or only people with native hawaiian heritagegt seems like a good basis in absence of evidence of the formerand in this case without blood quantum thats a lot of people with like a minor blood count so pretty much just go with most people anyway yet i dont feel right about saying that people who is family has lived here since the late 1800s  early 1900 is dont get a say theyre 4 or 5 generations deep this is their home now as much as anyone else is
2074	1	gt hawaii was and is a sovereign nation as recognized by the rest of the worldlike who what other country still trades with the kingdom of hawaii or recognizes the kingdom of hawaii when we voted to join the union we became a state of the us that is what we are now regardless of what happened that originally make us a territory the people of hawaii chose to become a state
2075	1	they could very well be sellouts  thats what federal recognition would do to our people  the vast majority of us oppose federal recognition
2076	1	like i said earlierafter 150 yearsyou find that people care a lot less especially when the alternative involves turning their entire way of life on its head
2077	1	im sorry i mean overpopulated in the sense that if we needed to self sustain we wouldnt be able to the natural resources arent enough to feed the current populationand id argue that oahu is definitely overpopulatedwhereas the outer islands have absolutely huge swaths of land under control of private ownership or corporate ownership which id agree is a gross misuse of land
2078	1	relax its a sticker lol
2079	1	gt there is more a doctor distribution problem than a shortagetrue the doctors exist they just all want to live in cities near the best paying and most cutting edge hospitals
2080	1	lets be honest the people with the trucks werent the kinds of kids that valued school
2081	1	wikipedia says he is native hawaiian
2082	1	its bad all the time dont be surprised if it takes you 45 minutes to get through kapaa
2083	1	to be fair weve been overpopulated past reasonable capacity for a while now sothis is probably a good thing
2084	1	i mean we could try electing kanaka maoli representatives to government but we dont and when we do people insist theyre sellouts
2085	1	uuuuuuuurgh this is going to drum up a bunch of sovereignty activists that think they have a more legit claim than the rest of us im already getting a headache from all the anticipated eye rolling
2086	1	who is them do you mean usor the current residents of hawaiior residents of hawaii before statehoodor the descendants of the former citizens of the kingdom of hawaiior only people with native hawaiian heritage or only people with a certain blood quantum of native hawaiian or just the sovereignty activists there are too many subcategories for them to be the term we use to define who gets to make the choice
2087	1	_  _  _  probably making more by selling to the mainland or something
2088	1	the sad thing about the trucks is it seems like thats where all the money goesincluding food money and rent they choose the status symbol of a custom jacked up truck over comfortable living i dont know why its compensating for something else they feel lacking in their lives probably
2089	1	i feel like if that was the case theyd understand gas prices and not go for a giant gas guzzling truck
2090	1	problem is that pretty much every prokingdom activist ive ever spoken to advocates for the complete removal of us military presence
2091	1	gt anyway all i can suggest is to stop talking about these sovereignty leaders and give them no more of your time and attention were all american by default but can choose to be hawaiian at heart that is what i choose to do regardless of some unobtainable political status tru dat
2092	1	gt expat american citizens sure but citizens of the kingdom none the lessgtgt whatwhat is hard to understand here they were former americans that became citizens of hawaii
2093	1	gt incarceration homeless alcoholism domestic abuse poverty etcoutside of homelessness and poverty those arent institutional problems theyre personal ones that being said the problems that spin out of poverty in other oppressed class cases drug abuse alcoholism homelessness arent being leveed against native hawaiians as a targeted group we have the same opportunities and choices as any other racial group living in the islands i dont know why so many of us make choices to fuck up but i dont believe it has anything to do with my race being native hawaiian has never made me more inclined to drug use or to not workinggtwesterners to go from 100 sustainable to importing 95 of all goods and services off the backs of first nation people is who have cared for this place for hundreds of yearsalso lets not act like our own ruling class didnt have a big fucking hand in selling all that stuff off to those westerners this was a 5050 issuethe monarchy was living large before the overthrow they werent struggling
2094	1	oh ok no i was thinking you meant chips and stuff
2095	1	so probably better to stay what we are right now then and remain first class citizens since accepting the offer would be a step down to 3rd class citizens and gaining sovereignty would be a step down to 3rd world country
2096	1	gt oh no downvotes life is overgt i am not here for karma or friendshipyeah never said you were i assumed you like everyone else that posted were here because you wanted to share your opinions and debate and all i was pointing out is that your debating kinda sucks because youre just throwing insults around thats not swaying any opinions thats not uniting anyone to your train of thought the downvotes only show that the people reading you arent agreeing with your wordsgt youve had every opportunity to have a reasonable conversation with everyone who posted here but immediately start with a dismissive attitudeyup i do start this with a dismissive attitude because ive been having this same debate for 30 years and ive yet to hear a real solid plan from the people that lead the opposing side of this debate probably because as you have just pointed out the majority of socalled leaders of the sovereignty movement are opportunists and conartists none the less those are the people who lead the debate on the issue in order to make any progress on the issue youll either have to contend with challenge or sway those people gt i dont have to convince any of them because they dont matter to the processbut then where does that leave you they wont follow you people that would rather remain in the us like me wont follow you who do you have then what support base even if youre ideas are goodwithout any support you cant do anything with themgt unfortunately right now though you just sound like a trollnah if i were a troll i wouldnt continue talking to you once you started getting riled up either way lets call it quits and enjoy time with friends and familyhappy holidays
2097	1	and then wed be at territory status again
2098	1	not surprising either if i lived in the mainland id want to escape that insanity for a tropical democratic stronghold too
2099	1	gthow hawaii became a territory violence illegality very much mattersnot really once all the original claimants and their direct descendants are gone we tried to revolt right after the overthrow and that didnt work the queen ordered a stand down and abdicated yeah the overthrow was illegal no one disputes that but almost 150 years later after being a state for 60 years the whole concept is pretty distant less people care than you thinkgtif you want to be an american go live in america if you arent a hawaiian national you are a war criminal for via occupation and you will be held accountableand that is why hawaii is never going to reclaim sovereignty this is the attitude of a minority sect of extremists not the general population
2100	1	yeah but the vast majority also oppose sovereignty we just want government to fucking workand fill the damn potholesand stop selling all the land to developers and big chemical companies but people dont vote and those that do only reelect the same people every year so nothing changes
2101	1	to be fair your counter examples are 2 very very small countries and a massive massive former empire built on the backs of literally billions of people with a massive difference between economic classes and a menacingly oppressive institutional governmentand when it comes to us in the first half of the list when compared to all those other placeswere alright just slowly reclaiming culture that had been oppressed into nonexistance and using it to push for new sustainable future prospects
2102	1	sorry to tell you but if you cant engage the general population which people like me represent then you wont get anywhere
2103	1	gt  and conversely they didnt need the english sign because people in america would never expect this to be a bathroom its probably just so people dont stand there wondering what the signs say
2104	1	i somehow doubt youre privy to very many conversations that exist in a realm of reality outside groups of conspiracy activists and people who have a weak grasp on how any kind of transition of power would go down just the numbers alone dont favor a sovereign state our population is 70 asian you think that 70 asian is going to cede control to such a minority group or are you advocating that the generational claims of people whove lived here for over 100 years are suddenly void because hawaiians since there are so few of us with any kind of pure bloodline that were fighting each other about who qualifies for that term claim they control everything the entire concept of hawaii for the native hawaiians is backward we need to look at ways to move forward together not split everything apart and grab as much of the spoils as we can while we can sovereignty is a pipe dream
2105	1	no youre missing my point im not saying this as a migrant im saying it as a native hawaiian for some reason these types of people in the sovereignty activist crowd seem to consider themselves more hawaiian than hawaiians like me because we dont agree with their outlandish point of view
2106	1	yeah but stolen from people who no longer exist by people who no longer exist and its not even something a majority of the descendants of the people it was stolen from want hence why i said the best course is a referendum vote similar to brexit then we find out if we need to bother with all the red tape or not at all
2107	1	well overthrowing governments is never legal really but the queen did abdicate the throne after the attempted rebellionas for the hawaii league annexation club guys heres just a few  sanford ballard dole was a lawyer and jurist in the hawaiian islands as a kingdomhawaii born subject of american parentage becomes pg president samuel mills damon march 13 1845  july 1 1924 was a businessman and politician in the kingdom of hawaii hawaii born subject of american parentage becomes pg vice president jonathan austin was a veteran of the american civil war president of paukaa sugar company and minister of foreign affairs for the kingdom of hawaii  william richards castle was a hawaiian lawyer and politician in the kingdom of hawaii benjamin franklin dillingham was a businessman and industrialist during the late kingdom of hawaii era peter cushman jones was a businessman and politician during the kingdom of hawaii american born naturalized hawaiian subject becomes pg minister of finance lorrin andrews thurston was an american lawyer politician and businessman born and raised in the kingdom of hawaii george norton wilcox was a businessman and politician in the kingdom of hawaiiof the guys on the committee of safetysix hawaiian subjects five american citizens a german subject and a british subject signed the january 16th letter so a mixed bag of subjects and foreign expats but all residents of hawaii at the time these guys were rich business owners and lawyers and judgesand all that they were close to the monarchy the overthrow was an inside job with outside support but not entirely orchestrated by outsiders still it was a messed up thing to do totally motivated by greed and private interests like most shitty historical decisions but still if we use people who can trance their ancestry to subjects of the kingdom of hawaii it would include the descendants of the very people that overthrew the monarchy in the first place and if we exclude them in favor of only native hawaiians you get into the blood quantum debate which is even messier
2108	1	the fuck does skin color have to do with this it may be a byproduct of globalization but that shit isnt limited to white people
2109	1	it wont  theres no evidence federal recognition has done alaska natives or indigenous tribes any good
2110	1	yeah were considered sellouts or indoctrinated by colonialism hence the eye rolling
2111	1	gt its not about comfort its about empathy hawaiians cannot thrive within the american system as it currently existswhy i mean this is obviously not true since so many people are thriving within the system as it currently existsgt hawaiians have the highest incarceration rate in the state we either choose to accept our fate as third class citizens or find a better solution that works in our favoror and this may be surprising we could stop committing crimes being outside america isnt going to suddenly fix the crime rate gt the problem with sovereignty is everyone only sees the political solution of full independence from the usyeah because thats the only thing people want the people who lead the sovereignty debate dont want the sovereignty ideas youre peddling and that is why it would never happen and thats why i think even discussing the issue is stupid its a fantasy and it takes time and manpower away from actually fixing shitgt your position in all of your comments are cynical ignorant and lacks empathy towards people and situation outside of your understanding or particular view it stinks of nimbyism  how so i come from a low wage farming family in rural hawaii i see the people around me dealing with some of the issues youve discussed and i see that those people have all the same opportunities as i do and as the kids of other races did this third class citizen as defined by race crap is bullshit its a class divide not a race divide and when i said different on the outer islands i meant it oahu has its problems because of how crowded over developed and economically class divided it is its problems stem from population sovereignty isnt going to fix that without pushing people out and even if you argue that the problems stem from government mismanagement those are elected officials they get elected year after year because the people choose them you think theyd chose different people in a sovereign system no itll still be all the same peoplegt but that doesnt mean we have to be obedient passive americans content in our overcrowded multigenerational homesthat is 100 what it means there isnt enough physical space for us to live differently unless you want to develop the few stretches of unspoiled wilderness we have left our way of life is fundamentally different than the everyone has their own land and dream house with a  white picket fence american dream viewand i never said obedient or passive i said we need to work in the system to make things better for the people and not only for the big businesses this is something happening across the country hawaii happens to be one of the few states not fucked by the political far right we have our own issues sure but those issues are addressed by people getting more involved not figuring out how to jump ship
2112	1	gt america still exists hawaiians still exist yes but today is america and the group of american expats who were citizens of the kingdom of hawaii that overthrew the monarchy are not remotely the same bodytoday is hawaiians and the hawaiians that lived under the rule of the monarchy arent remotely the same people eitherthe whole debate is a fruitless exercise in futility that the majority doesnt even want
2113	1	gt the kingdom was a cornerstone of industry and agriculture with massive labor force these businesses could be reestablished under favorable conditionsyoure argument is that you want to reopen the plantations you realize the lasting damage they did to the environment is still being dealt with right i cant think of a single person who ever pushed for independence that wanted to couple that with reopening the plantationsbesides youre thinking about the economy of the 1800s the world has changed a hell of a lot in the last 200 years that era of industry is gonegti agree with you that some hawaiians would like to go back in time but most just want a system that works in their benefit as a majority rather than a minorityexcept we are a minority wed be easily outnumbered by the asian and caucasian population vote just as we are nowgtin addition im going to say that if a new government would be formed it would not include a monarchy or deal in blood quantum this is also very counter to any sovereignty argument ive ever heard
2114	1	no doubt
2115	1	which once again begs the question if they did lose the case and by some weird twist of fategave hawaii back to hawaii whats going to stop the people from just readmitting us into the us by popular vote
2116	1	yeah but salt air and tech though
2117	1	i like them better than the windmills that dwarf the mountains
2118	1	they probably still dont let him drive though
2119	1	to be fair it could be that cars are their one main hobby an expensive a hell hobby but a hobby they save for i guess
2120	1	how so the overthrow was carried out by citizens of the kingdom expat american citizens sure but citizens of the kingdom none the less the seated president of the us at the time was super opposed to the overthrowby your metrics from before the descendants of these people should have the right to have a say in the sovereignty of hawaii they were citizens before the overthrow
2121	1	i had heard about that all those big empty high rises and last time i was on oahu back in may i was surprised by how many of those large apartment blocks were blacked out at night except for maybe a handful of windows doesnt seem like many of them have people in them but as far as individual homes go its not like there is a lot of space left i mean just look at a satellite map of oahu its like a grey swarm eating the green mountains
2122	1	gt what needs to be realized in hawaii is all these mainland haole ideas of exporting vegetation and cattle out of hawaii doesnt work rather than exporting the attention and focus should be farming and a limited amount of cattle for local consumption hawaii could be selfsufficient in many areas if the state made that a priorityoh my god what is fucking happeningimagreeing with you this is weirdwe do need to switch to local crop and food production for local use rather than relying on shipping in all our stuff
2123	1	likely because of how overpopulated oahu is
2124	1	after reading many of your responsesim fairly certain that the sovereignty youre arguing in favor of and the sovereignty nearly every other sovereignty advocate ive ever heard speak are advocating forare two very different things it feels like youre arguing that we should go back to a period of governance that was before annexation and statehood but post monarchy similar to the era under the usurpersexceptwith an elected government in control whereas almost every other activist ive ever heard is arguing for a return to the period before the overthrow honestly both seem equally far fetched because they rely on the united states to willingly let hawaii leave the union which is essentially impossible unless the us falls apart because one state leaving would start a chain reaction of other states choosing to leave it cant be done
2125	1	gt the majority of socalled leaders of the sovereignty movement are opportunists and conartists you will never see these groups acting outside of their own self interests like a nonprofit or social service would you dont have to wait for the us government to grant you sovereignty to help your neighbor improve your local park or volunteer for a homeless shelter right all of them preach to save hawaii after the lands are returned and kingdom money is found never before yeah not holding my breathat least we agree so far as this much these irritating people are the reason im so closed minded to the sovereignty debate and consider it a waste of time and like you said right here you dont have to wait for the us government to grant you sovereignty to help your neighbor improve your local park or volunteer for a homeless shelter right id rather focus on the things we can do rather than on the meaningless back and forth of sovereignty
2126	1	specificallytoyota tacomas or those tiny low rider ones
2127	1	its not as impossible as people make it seem sure owning an individual home is tough but we always were a society that lived in multigenerational family homes living like that makes affording a house way easier people just want to live the american dream way of moving out after highschool and owning your own home thats not how we lived here for generations its not suddenly going to be easier to do
2128	1	im not saying your ideas dont have their merits im saying no one will listen to them hence why ive been pointing out the futility of the sovereignty debate all over the threadspecifically because as youve pointed out the leaders of the sovereignty movement dont want the same thing as you thus you are a separate faction of think than they are i admit i am on the side of the remain argumentas im sure youll find the vast majority is but the fact that as ive said youre proposed ideas are so different than what the sovereignty leaders push for means your ideas have no backing or wide supporteven if they are better than the concepts pushed by those same leaders if one day you andor your train of thinking becomes the main push of the sovereignty movement then maybe this entire back and forth would be worth having but until you can convince the people that actually want to leave that your ways are better than their ways youll find little real ground to stand on in this debategt i took the time to educate myself on the subject and i highly encourage you to do the same im sorry if the information i am peddling is new to you but it is not new by any stretch of the imagination to people who work and study in governancealso just some further points on how to better argue your position if you want people to take you seriously in discourse like this dont speak this way especially when you dont know anything about the person youre speaking to so far ive spent the last few days discussing your positions with my peers and everyone is giving the same kind of feedback that guy has an interesting take on it but sounds like a dick i wouldnt willingly follow him you keep talking down to the people youre responding to and talking like they know less than you that is not how you win debates or inspire confidence if you need any kind of correlating proof of this review the upvotedownvote counters between our posts not a single one of those downvotes is coming from me youre not doing a great job of getting your ideas across to the other readers on this subreddit without sounding arrogant regardless of how much merit those ideas may have
2129	1	gt its really great that others can rely on family but sadly that is not an option for all native hawaiiansand i think that speaks to a deficit in how far weve fallen culturally as a people we used to take care of each other communally not just as family groups in that sense the community should ensure that people dont end up struggling like you did
2130	1	why is it so hard to believe that people arent unhappy id bet you the vast majority of people here are content being americans hence why we voted to become a state in the first placewhat we need to do is fight to make america better for us not figure out the best way to ditch because as weve discussed theyre never letting us leave and the more time we spend figuring out the best impossible scenario in which we break away the more time we waste not making the current scenario work for the future we can sit around theorizing the what ifs of an independent hawaii till we all tun grey and dieand nothing will have changed because we arent doing anything to make it change id rather focus on propagating our culture and protecting our environment than pushing for politics that are just dreams being had by people who dont want to work with the system we have because they dont like the results of the majoritymost of us acknowledge that the past happenedand that it was fucked but 150 years later hawaii isnt what it was were a giant mix of peoples from all over now people with generational family ties to these islands going back a century or more people who are americans as much as we all think the president is a massive turd i cant support a nationalist agenda because that will always come with a push for this is ours those that dont agree should leave and thats not part of the values i believe in
2131	1	gt if we used more of the old sugarcane land to grow corn for consumption here instead of seed stock for the mainlandsure but problem is all that land is still owned by corporations and not local farmers so they wont grow for local consumption while they can gmo seed crops for the mainland with the current set up there just isnt enough resources land and sea to some extent to be self sustaining at this population density
2132	1	gt wow colonization mindset still deeply intrenched in youman this is always so cringey to hear from people who never lived in a preamerica hawaiigt good thing you dont speak on behalf of all hawaiiansi mean neither do you really there are just more people like me than like you because there are always more moderates than extremists thus i may not speak for them but i do speak with them
2133	1	sounds like a shit ton of red tape for no real difference probably easier just to take a vote seeing if the majority wants to secede at all like some kind of brexit but for hawaiia hawexit if you will
2134	1	to be fair its not much different than now and the whole legal claim over stolen islands thing isnt going anywhere couple more generations and there wont be anyone with prestate existence to make those claims
2135	1	gt it is unfortunate that most hawaiians dont understand basic international laws or geopolitics which says how much work needs to be done before this is even remotely a realityits not just that many people dont understand its that they dont care many activists just want direct control and say over what they say is theirs whether that means the people that currently live there have to leave or not is beside the point to them i mean do i wish we had more local governmental control over all the lands weve sold to big ag corporations and private developers now and in the past yeah but i really dont see a future in which all that land is just given back willingly in the eyes of those businesses and developers they purchased that fair and square yeah its shitty but it is what it is what we need to do is put down stricter limits on single ownership land purchases so that giant buyouts like this cant happen
2136	1	gt combine that with roommates a working spouse or living with family and you have a decent chunk of disposable income left not enough to buy a beachfront mansion but certainly enough to splurge on a vacation or some concert tickets a few times a yearthis right here is the real kicker that people seem to not realize the secret is a combination of communal living and living within one is means single living in a big house yeah thats gonna be tough but living in a decently sized home with family or flatmates that pay rent on time yeah totally manageable will you have a luxurious beachside bungalow no but youll be fine in a decent 3 bed 2 bath
2137	1	gt a white child from manoa and a hawaiian child from nanakuli unfortunately do not have the same opportunitiessure but a hawaiian child from manoa and a white child from manoa do youre comparing to neighborhoods with very different earning potentials thats a class splitnot a racial oneit could just be that the situation on oahu is very different than on the outer islands which wouldnt be surprising considering its entirely urbanized setup but many of the problems oahu faces are also symptoms of extreme overpopulation so it may not be racially aligned but more based on class
2138	1	im glad we agree  federal recognition is a sham
2139	1	oh yeah i know what you mean some people are definitely passion project people when it comes to these big trucks but i guess what im talking about is how you see a lot of lifted custom parts trucks in low income housing neighborhoods its totally a status symbol thing my wife is cousins are like this hard living but blowing all their money on big truck payments
2140	1	or even betterwhat happens if the majority wants to reannex to america

2150	1	the whole island has a stray cat problem but yeah the hills above there are full of em we picknicked there when i was a kid once looking back it was pretty hilarious
2151	1	i like most of the stuff they have like the katsu musubis and hand rolls the only problem is a lot of that stuff has 200 of your daily allowance of sodium or more but i still eat at least one item when i go back home

2162	1	that is fair you dont  but you implied that eating turkey for christmas was something uone_crack_nacnac made up when it is definitely a thing that happens  my local whole foods has a whole turkeybased catering menu you can order from
2163	1	i mostly agree that china would not currently be a threat to an independent hawaii although things are changing pretty rapidly so one shouldnt be so surechina is bad behavior in tibet and xinjiang is pretty evident  unless one is an uncritical supporter of the prc it is clear which side is the right side
2164	1	keehi was always ratchet i lived there when we boatsat a large boat moored there for weeks on end when i was a kid
2165	1	yes in cities like tokyo and kyoto signs are generally in both english and japanese  bus subway and train announcements and digital sign boards as wellregarding the train i think the pass makes sense if youre doing a roundtrip from tokyo to kyoto and back but not if youre only travelling one way  the lonely planet japan has some good insights on the tradeoffsa tour package provides its greatest value in convenience  you pay a premium in exchange for not having to deal with booking train tickets hotel rooms tickets to sights or figuring out schedule or transportation  it is really a personal choice  maybe get your son to be part of figuring out stuff if you dont do the package  it would be a good opportunity for him to develop the skills for independent travel
2166	1	oh dont i know it surfing was far far cheaper than video games
2167	1	there fact that you assumed that we would glean all of this nuance between your first and second post is hilariousso based on what youre saying there is a segment of the hawaii japanese population that is clinging tightly to their culture and that they have a high demand for products from daiso  why would you not want daiso to come then  in the city of honolulu population of around 402k japanese make up 20 of the population roughly 80k  that is your starting customer base if youre daiso  why would you not want a strong international retail business to come in and serve this base  because is offends your sensibilitieshey we agree on the jones actlastly regarding your assumption that japanese moving to hawaii dont want to assimilate let me provide some personal insight since you cant provide any data  my dad is brother and sister both moved their families to hawaii from japan  both families moved to hawaii for new opportunities and better connection between all of our families  there were definitely some rocky moments along the way nothing is ever sunshine and roses but ill be damned if i let you make such stupid sweeping generalizations as clinging tightly to their culture
2168	1	gt  china hasnt colonized another country for hundreds of years china invaded tibet in 1950 so youre at least a couple hundred years off in your estimateampx200b
2169	1	no kidding apparently 5 guys burger place does this you get a fuckton of fries well jokes on them i get the burger by itself as a lettuce wrap
2170	1	moiliili to downtown is a nice walk yeah town oahu seems so small after living on the mainland so long yeah it is all walkable i found colorado springs to be walkable but yeah it gets frickin cold in the winter
2171	1	i dont disagree that some form of redress needs to be made to what happened to hawaii in 1893  as a kamaāina it is something i care about too
2172	1	yeah nothing especially saltier about mainland food although the portions tend to be bigger
2173	1	lol
2174	1	at least in hawaii drivers slow down when it rains in california they speed up
2175	1	housing is hard for locals housing is nearly impossible for people coming from the mainland because there is already so much local demand add the fact youre not on island probably dont have jobs lined up and have two huge scary dogs
2176	1	actually called semislugs
2177	1	wish i were that young again
2178	1	serious question wouldnt you clean it as soon as you killed it
2179	1	freezing doesnt remove mercury tho
2180	1	ive heard putting the litter box outside works as well and would tend to have a better range
2181	1	haha and maybe you were smart enough to not reveal you were fighting on behalf of a haole
2182	1	i have mailed my sister sooooooo much salad dressing at this point
2183	1	this so much work with bird rescue if you want to help birds
2184	1	gti dont know a single person eating turkey for christmas on the mainland  gt  gtit is like something you just made upnope  had dinner with friends last year and they served turkey  told them chinese food this year
2185	1	because the islands are full i already told you there is not enough jobs and housing for the locals the majority of the former pay too low and the latter cost way too much even if you do somehow make the move youre probably not going to stay past 3 years before you move back so youre not only an outsider in social circles people arent going to open up to you because why put the effort in to make a lifelong friendship with someone that is moving 3500 miles away in just a few years there are so many threads on here about people moving and crying about how the jobs suck and pay too little rent is too high they cant make any friends and how hawaii sucks and they cant wait to leave might as well save you the hassle
2186	1	like teri beef isnt salty as hell
2187	1	as a tech worker that grew up in hawaii this would be awesomehawaii is an awesome destination to me for any tech conference and i would jump on it in a heart beat especially if my employer is paying for it and even better if there are jobs that pays on par adjusted to the cost of living in hawaiithe only problem is it is a long flight from the us east coastalso hawaii seems like a decent bridge between the us and asia just simply based on its geography and time zone with a growing asia im kinda surprised that there arent more offices based in hawaii i guess maybe california is still close enough
2188	1	not really
2189	1	and your parents didnt give you lickens for sticking up for them
2190	1	yes  kapolei regional park
2191	1	not when youve got a board you traded a guy some big funny silver coin for you walk with it to your local beach and you just need some new wax once a year
2192	1	funny until you decided to insult hawaii redditors
2193	1	gt  the sea life on the big island sometimes seems like they are on steroidsall of this was back in the day on the big islandthe largest pufferfish ive ever seen in the water was in puako and it was fully puffed out  my dad and i used to pull bambucha kine holehole off one of the docks in kona at night  we also used to pick namako out there at night on the reefs with hardly any problems  my dad could also regularly catch good size menpachi at night out there  largest opihi that i used to see on the bi was only maybe quarter size though no half dollars
2194	1	i remember when this was done  we were school kids then and would picnic at sandy beach rather than waikiki because of the nice expanse of sand there  but with the new sand at waikiki we started going there for the calmer waters
2195	1	stay one humbuggah

2197	1	did he introduce it as a hawaiian chant or dance maybe he really just likes doing it
2198	1	geevum   a break
2199	1	exactly
2200	1	oh i know i know but at age 14 it was the best bang for the buck entertainment around but yeah surfing is gotten a reputation as the rich people is sport because of this travel owning a car to drive to the best spots etc the bensons up the street from us were not poor their daughter becky made some impact on the nascent womens surfing scene  after we were foreclosed out of where we were and moved to the windward side there were basically no surfers except for kids like me whod walk to the local tiny break it was still fun
2201	1	im in my 80s and started working with computers as a programmer with ibm since the 1960s  worked with the very earliest pcs laptops in the interim   was awed when the internet first came into being commercially   communicated with coworkers using the very earliest electronic mail which became the email  so this is one old fogy that knows a thing or two about using computers and the internet                                                                     edit i returned home to honolulu in the 1970s and the only computer programming job i could find was with the military working at hickam afb  i was the only local at that office and was made to feel very uncomfortable by the military personnel working in the same office  took it for 6 months then applied for and got a job in the washington dc area and regretfully left hawaii once again
2202	1	none of what you say is even remotely true  tibet paid tribute to the qing court as did many other sovereign nations at the time including japan korea and thailand but they were an independent nation  china violently invaded tibet in 1950 and the tibetan people remain under oppressive chinese rule which threatens their very cultural identity and existenceperhaps if i were more ignorant of chinese and tibetan history and had not traveled to tibet and seen things with my own eyes i might view things differentlyas a member of an indigenous people that has experienced injustice yourself i would expect you to have more sympathy for other oppressed peoples and a better understanding of history before making assertions
2203	1	like i said before if you are dumb enough to have shitty friends like this you deserve all of this
2204	1	no arare ouch even really americanass stores here on the mainland tend to have some arare and if you know to look in the mexican stuff iso peanuts although they call them something else
2205	1	no i replied where i intended to
2206	1	youre focusing on the wrong details here pal
2207	1	houses are small gatherings are big  when you move the cars the carport is perfect size  bigger than any room in the house  plus you dont even need to take off your slippahs unless you need go to the bathroom
2208	1	yes this
2209	1	youll probably need to know locals in your industry in order to get a job there  youll also need to be local to get a job if youre not already living there while applying for a job theyre most likely not even going to consider you for it even if youre more than qualified  also be prepared for a significant salary reduction no matter what industry youre in or who you know  that is the reality of your work situation in hawaii right now  ive got family in hawaii my dad is side is from the big island there i look like a localcan speak pidgin and i still wouldnt even consider trying to move there because there is no way id survive without going homeless  the cost of living there is insane and i currently live in the bay area ca where it is one of the highest col is in the nation  if youre from the mainland youll be put in that group when you deal with others and while people wont necessarily be mean to you because of it theyre not going to go out of their way to make friends with you at all because they know that youll leave soon  there is a reason why there are so many people from hawaii that live on the mainland gt and it is jobs that pay a decent salary  period  the people that live in hawaii right now dont exactly live in a laid back paradise  theyre scrapping and saving and living with ten relatives in a two bedroom house every day in order to survive
2210	1	more like a dollar store but from japan the article even says it is known as the japanese dollar store but everything costs 150300
2211	1	man  this is a hell of a stretch for an argument  let is follow the logic  assumption 1 people move from japan to hawaii  i think that we all agree with this  assumption 2 japanese people moving to hawaii dont like it once theyre there  care to quantify this number with proper sourcesassumption 3 said japanese nationals who dont like it in hawaii decide to open up daiso in hawaii  im guessing you are assuming that their doing this out of spite  anyhoo daiso has 60 locations see wikipedia in the us and have been operating here since 2005 so the fact that theyve stayed out of hawaii for this long is amazing hell maybe even bad business sense  assumption 4 exorbitant mark ups on shitty products  so now youre shitting on them for moving to the land of capitalism and practicing it  you know what is an exorbitant markup  movie popcorn and soda  healthcare  beer at a mlb gameso  no dude  you got it way wrong

2216	1	unless i am reading a different post i am not seeing a job duration or specific job titleand to answer your question yes they suggested shipping a motorcycle out thinking they can sell it at the end of their trip if you just throw out 3000 for buying a shitty motorcycle shipping it out and getting it registered then assuming you can even sell it over the course of 70 days average summer for a student based on my wife being a teacher for nearly a decade that comes out to 43dayyou can rent a corolla for 31day from hnl if you want to explore all over the island for two months having a rental car is about a million times safer bet than riding a motorcycle around that will probably get stolen halfway through his trip
2217	1	in my experience hawaii drivers are slower traffic in general is about 10mph slower on average than california and they are indeed more courteous they dont have the polish a california hotshot has but the occasionally klutzy things they do are done more slowly so what might be more serious on the mainland ends up being a minor scratch or fender bender in hawaii
2218	1	it is shoulder of pork and ham it is not junk trimmings ampx200boff brands like tempt treet etc well ymmv

2222	1	my old man used to make me hold the flashlight for him and walk alongside him on the reef while he dove at night  one time back in the 80 is in kona he started to point at a hole in the reef so i shined the flashlight where he was pointing  i saw the biggest puhi ive ever seen sticking its head out of a puka in the reef  the teeth on that thing looked razor sharp  i was scared just looking at it outside of the water  my old man just kept pointing at it didnt scare him at all he is crazy

2243	1	lifeguards are county not state we have them at all hawaii county beaches also lifeguards handle chlorination and general cleaning at public pools the county of hawaii hires a separate maintenance man for repairsif the county of oahu doesnt see the need to staff all beaches that is their prerogative im just telling all of you guys it is a liability issue and you will one day pay through the taxes and budget of your county if you dont ensure appropriate steps
2244	1	gt there are no lifeguards at waipio palolu or waimanu beaches you mean pololu valley you cant even spell it right second all three valleys are not county beaches they are owned by bishop estatesit is clear you really dont know what you are talking aboutedit go ahead and downvote they are practically in my backcountry and i hike and hunt in those areas

2255	1	this is definitely snow we saw it fall from the sky and there still is snow today it doesnt melt off here for a long time due to the cold temperatures  i spend enough time up here to see the difference between frost and snow
2256	1	his theory was wrong but his experiment of replication showing sailing across the pacific by primitive built raft was not let is give thor some credit when polynesians saw what he did it spurred hawaiians to seek out their ku holo ability ad mau to pass it along when he was watching the navigation art passing away
2257	1	gt one was some haole hippie coupleffs moon you just had to add that racist description didnt youedit yeah moon i know you are my vindictive downvoting stalker because i always call on your bs
2258	1	when did you take in a homeless ill even cut slack if you helped give them some food or clothing
2259	1	i stand corrected on homeland security but coast guard is not under the department of defense i didnt mention the uscg sucks for everyone all around
2260	1	there is always at least one firecracker a night this time of year saturday had choke after max is fight
2261	1	not now of course however there were droughts in the past even wetside kamuela went on water restrictions in the past
2262	1	yeah it didnt come as any shock
2263	1	can some one point me to a culture that isnt a warrior culture
2264	1	it is a normal thought process of moon
2265	1	send money so i can help support my ohana  stay awayedit truth hurts
2266	1	that is legit funny especially right now take a look at my comment historyi live in the real world  one where a bunch of christians over threw hawaii before my grandparents where alive  hawaii is a state and will most likely always be one until america collapses  that is just how things are going to be  hawaii as a nation will need to figure out it is own whole economy  insurance telecom banking currency visas no more federal spending for air ports harbors highways etchow will tourism work  americans will need a visa  japanese need a visa    people that truely want hawaii as it is own nation should visit other developing worlds and ask them selves if they are ready for thatand youre a chinese imperialist
2267	1	hehmaybe we should send him some pakalolo to calm his ptsd down
2268	1	hmmm have you been to the bayou country of louisiana region
2269	1	nalo farms decided to spend over a million on a super up to date facility so they could be one of the first to be fsma compliantturns out no one in hawaii is becoming fsma compliant that is doing cut greens  so the market they hoped to corner never came to be  this money was spent 201011 turns out a one million  facility that dosnt do anything other than make your facility more sterile isnt great for profits
2270	1	mahalo got to meet some amazing people so far
2271	1	awesome i wish there was more written about palmyra especially beyond just that trial but besides the odd article here and there its mostly historical material thats available
2272	1	gt 1 in 1928  1425 today if anyone is curiouscool is there a handy website that you used to calculate that
2273	1	i dont know that area at all  it really depends on the last lava flow for soil amount  hawaii is not a great place to home stead or farm  equipment is not easy to find and over priced for what it is everything has a premium shipping price  land is not cheap and the land lords mostly suckbut if you can actually budget and produce you can make money and not worry about to much competition  there are probably no grain silos in the state because no one grows grain here
2274	1	what is this logic
2275	1	ohhhh i see
2276	1	fun fact it is not  it may be the united states of america but it is not america
2277	1	theyve had the road closed to the public for most of the time it is been snowing but they will probably open it during the day tomorrow unless it is really nasty  there should still be some snow
2278	1	correct amundo
2279	1	gt how high is the level of nimbyism in hawaii that people donate a excellent facility for the kids and all people can do is grumbleactually there is no nimbyism here i am okay with such i am concerned about the health of the children however the questions remain and the article does not articulate the certain obvious measures that have to be addressed you have liability issues so who is going to pay for the insurance and lifeguards etc also you do know that the homeless will take it over as well when it is late or even in the day to take a bathgtit is like people cant see the forest for the treesmaybe you dont and havent thought it out but people like myself who are resource caregivers for the children you have to place the physical safety of the children as paramount
2280	1	okay ill be like that guy and delete so no one knows shhhh ill be stealthiest as a mouse around cats
2281	1	yeah i have heard of people doing this it is pretty hilarious and smart  dean okimoto former owner of nalo when he was president of the hawaii farm bureau was so pro fsma that he talked about making all the farmers at the farmers market be fsma compliant  guy only has him self to blame on the failure of the farm  leveraged it to death  i work with several distributor that where about to only take fsma compliant products and than quickly stopped once they told the farmers and most of us said not going to happengoing to be interesting to see how it plays out here the guys that are fsma compliant are having to fly out and house the auditors while they are here it is really costly just to get them to come than you have to pay for the audit
2282	1	gt manapua is usually in demandhaha what manapua is plentiful here they even sell it with fundraising here on big island 4 for 7 i just paid on monday for adobo style
2283	1	humor isnt understood it is just gotten  this isnt nearly as funny as aquabruddha  and its not just hawaiians with that old wives tale  it is all over the east coast with jelly fish stings and other places with other types of stings
2284	1	it burns very cleanly as it is 8090 methane methane combustion releases h2o and co2 as byproducts vs dieselfuel oil which release those compounds as well as nitrous oxides smog co carbon monoxide and soot in and of itself it is a potent greenhouse gas so it is important to have a commercial market to incentivize capture as a byproduct of other fossil fuel productionobviously renewable is better but lng is the least worst nonrenewable option in many cases it is also burned directly in a gas turbine like a jet engine instead of firing boilers to run a steam turbine so the power plants water consumption is reduced as wellthis is what we dont want run off imported indonesian coal they have to use a limestone injection process to scrub the worst contaminants out of the exhaust stream but they do a poor job only capturing 75 of what modern systems do and the exhaust of those modern systems is still dirtier than a lng planthttpsenwikipediaorgwikiaes_hawaii_power_planthttpsenwikipediaorgwikiaes_hawaii_power_plant
2285	1	im originally from texas there are homes in the sabine river area with the same nice and swampy with good gator hunting

2287	1	east asia 711 gt hawaii 711 gt mainland 711i refuse to go to 711 on mainland but the bentos and manapuas saved my life when i was in uh in hilo not to mention it is one of the few places that can get me to drink coffee
2288	1	an obvious troll who doesnt frequent here gtfo
2289	1	yep especially when a redditor from hawaii comes on and stalks all my comments and downvotes every single one of them every day
2290	1	true enough my bad but i prefer snopes over this one this was taught in international business school by my professor decades ago i guess he didnt do his research either
2291	1	i see plenty of your comments have 1 up doot  it is probably just because people dont like what you write  not some conspiracy
2292	1	dude chill out you are not from here and trying to be an instigator your whole account is littered with antidemocrat diatribes and you are not just about bernie or tulsi either
2293	1	na we just know how it is and if your coming with no jobs dogs  that will be in quarantine for 6 months min and high expectations especially in oahu prepared to be disappointed and or homeless with in a year
2294	1	tell me about her cult status  almost all politicians are apart of some type of cult
2295	1	well though you didnt get a case number im sure they will turn it over to cps for investigation problem is when cps comes around everyone clams up in the household and neighbors as well hopefully there was physical evidence on the child of abuse to allow them to take away the childrenyou did your part correctly and that is all you can do thanks for looking after the child
2296	1	i actually agree that stickers arent something to be upset about but youre just making yourself look like the idiot the other side looks like a bastion of reason compared to you
2297	1	no one gives a shit about her supposed cult status other than hawaii redditors from what i have seen
2298	1	yep we have laws that trump broke and he will be punished accordingly
2299	1	turkey for christmas

2307	1	i edited in mauna loa because the article mentions it and i forgot it in my last commentdurt i have a geologist friend who says theyve been interested in mauna loas new activity since kilauea stopped and theyve been considering increasing the warning level back to yellow which is why i started checking out the earthquakes on it
2308	1	it is so fascinating how we can better and better deduce how the internal plumbing of our volcanoes actually works crossing my fingers though that mauna loa stays quiet for a while

2311	1	it has nothing to do with criminalsgtthis is the latest move in the presidents long record of prioritizing harsh immigration and asylum restrictions and one thats sure to raise eyebrowsthe white house had hesitantly backed off the plan in august before reversing course in essence the administration has now decided that vietnamese immigrants who arrived in the country before the establishment of diplomatic ties between the united states and vietnam are subject to standard immigration lawmeaning they are all eligible for deportationhttpswwwtheatlanticcominternationalarchive201812donaldtrumpdeportvietnamwarrefugees577993
2312	1	gt not natural born citizen meaning in one of the us stateswrong moongtin addition persons who are born outside of the united states may be us citizens at birth if one or both parents were us citizens at their time of birth persons who are not us citizens at birth may become us citizens through naturalization naturalization is the conferring of us citizenship after birth by any means whatsoeversourcehttpswwwuscisgovpolicymanualhtmlpolicymanualvolume12partachapter2htmltulsi is mother carol porter was born in decatur indiana that qualifies tulsi as a natural born citizen
2313	1	no not really we had several hikers in 1992 fall into puu oo crater and many more over the years cited fr going n the back trails to puu oo as well over the years it is a common occurrence county and national park had to staff the viewing areas to prevent and catch those trying to cross the lower and upper lava flows over the pali isin 1991 another set of tourists went on a lava bench to take pics of the flow into the ocean at kalapana one fell in and disappeared and 4 others were burned we even had one tour operator who was doing illegal tours taking people the active flow areas and to puu oo rim and he was shut down and fined heavily
2314	1	there old  old people use the internet different  they dont realize you can just search questions they think it is mostly for shit talking on fb

2321	1	if you go to the fda fsma website you can read all the bullet point regulations there are alot  some of them smart most of them hugely burdensom and meant to put a boot on small local producers   one of my favorite examples is that you are to keep a animal foot print log and than to also keep a  log of any animal poop you find   and is it is in a production field to throw out any thing with im 20 ft of it
2322	1	no it is not it was always specifired  county beachsecond just because there are beaches in hawaii county does not make it a county beachhapuna is a prime example it is a state beachbishop estates is its own trust and 2nd largest owner of land next to the state they contract for conservation management through the state of hawaii you need to learn the difference if a county operated beach vs stateoperated and private ownership
2323	1	gtoh fuck off i m not antidemocratdont try to con me by trying to hide behind the satiric username gtin the meantime what the fuck are you going about the shit trump has caused like this httpsyoutubeygvx1z6tdgiim sorry refresh my memory again because the link you gave doesnt connect with any of my comments on reddit

2334	1	gt they are neanderthal uneducated uncivilized idiotskind of like you
2335	1	you underestimate the impenetrable defenses or attention span of a political base
2336	1	you can hunt in backside waipio along with the trail to waimanu valley and waimanu valley itself and at the ridge line of both atop the valleys as long as you have a permit from bishop estates and a hunting license bishop estates wants the feral pig population to be eradicated as it is destroying the vegetation in the area this is why the oahu downvoters need to stfu not you as you asked a legit question and learn something about bi from old timers
2337	1	95th percentile would be 14001450
2338	1	thats the number one issue i come across when talking about palmyra  ive spent the last few years trying to change that but its a long hard road to dispelling those myths
2339	1	unless youre hillary clinton right
2340	1	agreed last week they had a story headlining hawaii is the least charitable state we were 5th worst in donations to charities but 2nd in volunteer support i was like wtf charity is not all about giving cash to charitable organizations all the food we donated and volunteer help we gave to such as kauai flood victims housing and food and shelter for the leilani residents speak volumes of hawaii residents being charitable far better to give actual food shelter and back muscle labor to helo than piss it on organizations that spend most of the cash donations on their executives and employee salaries
2341	1	awesome im going for the first time in january get to do some historical research for the nature conservancy if youre interested in palmyras history give my archive a glance the source link and i try to post photos regularly on the archives instagram feed palmyraarchive
2342	1	most likely they are old  most young people know it takes less time to google than start a reddit post or fb than wait for a response
2343	1	jesus christ why do you need to make yourself look like such an ass calling someone an idiot instead of making a productive argument or having a conversation like a normal person just degrades any validity your point had
2344	1	gt isnt the middle made with lardit was until the early 80s now it is made with a soy based creme

2346	1	this is a splash padhttpscrs4reccomwpcontentuploads201708splashpad_winterizationjpgit involves water safety and maintenance so you will need lifeguards for safety reasons
2347	1	no stores that need as much space as that probably wont come here see how long weve held out without a walmart we also have a lot of local shops and us nyers are very prideful of that why go to a daiso when you can go to the dollar store owned by your neighbor only way they come to ny is if they make the stores way smaller like everyone else who has
2348	1	west texas

2355	1	oh i feel like an outsider here too mostly from a cultural perspective since white folks assume i think like them they tend to be confused when i dont  honestly i do not have a place i feel comfortable or at home culturally at
2356	1	this guy knows whats up
2357	1	gt i was abused as a kid and while it wasnt as blatant as that usually in public it was widely known that my mother was abusing the hell out of us and not a single person ever stepped in i will never just stand by and i have and will continue to report abuse like that when i see itas a resource caregiver aka foster parent i am truly sad that was part of your life it sucks that a mother would do that as children are born expected to be safe from harm and when i see others betraying that trust welli just start boiling underneath as wellyou did the right thing calling the police just curious did you hang around and describe to the police the incident and get a case number to follow up
2358	1	well i dont know them do i
2359	1	seriously thoughif we sold off three stealth bombers just three old used bombersbamwall paid for for someone who sees himself as such a deal man i can not believe he hasnt offered up something like that not like he is worried about resignations from military leadership
2360	1	palmyra historian here going to butt in and answer some of your questions from what i know because i love talking about the atoll  palmyra is currently owned and managed by the nature conservancy specifically the hawaiian office  it has no permanent residents but is visited by small groups at a time rarely more than 1012 usually potential donors or scientists flown there on a chartered jetit has several well maintained facilities and small cabins mostly used by visiting scientists or those managing the atoll along with the remnants of various military structures leftover from its use as a ww2 naval base  the sharks in the waters are mostly black tips not too large and not dangerous based on my research and conversations with current staff  during the 1800 is and early 1900 is there were thousands of them living in and around the lagoons and reefs with no reported deaths or attacks  the navy finished their construction activities around 1944 and wiped out much of the plant and animal life both on the atoll and in the waters around it  i have diagrams and charts in my archive showing the physical difference before and after the work its really staggering  much of that life has been revitalized and is getting better which is what most of the scientists study in one way or anothera quick note on vincent bugliosi is book and the sea will tellmuch of it is misleading and over dramatic  he used his position in that case much like he did in the manson trials to further his finances and career  he would take oneoff instances and make them sound like norms  people have lived in isolation on palmyra never for more than a year or so in most cases since the mid 1800 is and there are very very few documented cases of injuries related to sharks or anything else  if youre interested in that case i highly recommend reading final argumenthttpswwwamazoncomfinalargumentperpetratedstephaniesubsequentebookdpb00sqi549k by tom bucy  he revisits the facts and context of the case and presents a much better understanding of what actually happened  hope that is not too long winded just excited about interest in palmyra and want to make sure everyone has the factsampx200b
2361	1	it has splash pools what if a child or even an adult fell in and banged his head and drowned with no lifeguards

2366	1	gt hawaii has no native snakes and the last time a snake was found in the state was in 1998 said hotypical of state employees to forget such which you gave evidence of that is why they screw up everything on  a state level which will cost the taxpayer money down the road
