667	1	i agree with your point about not proofreading but the error is almost as bad as a native english speaker saying you be want to eat some food the words sound completely different and a native speaker with at least a middle school education would immediately recognize that i realize it is anecdotal but of my friends and acquaintances who did not finish or make it to high school their spelling still produces the same sounds but with the wrong lettersit would be something like ay versus hay or baca vs vaca these errors use the wrong letters to produce the same sounds as the actual word it would be like writing reeding as opposed to reading it is a misspelling of the same word not usage of the wrong word
668	1	all stem from the same tree
669	1	the point idk agree with is that 2nd generations in the us tend to glorify the old country and even into the 3rd and 4th but american culture gets injected pretty hard to the point that the 3rd generation isnt fluent in the grandparents original language

688	1	it helps when the languages you know are related to each other it makes picking up grammar and vocabulary way easier learning languages outside of the family of the ones you speak can have added challenges because aspects can be totally alien with no equivalent in your own language some can be so distant that wordforword translations make no sensespeaking 5 languages in a single language family is a whole different ball game from speaking 5 languages from 5 different languages familiesfortunately spanish is related to english enough that a lot of wordforword translation makes sense learn all of the conjugations all of the irregular conjugations and it is pretty much all vocabulary from there spanish is highly inflected but it is way more organized than english ive heard it is usually harder for spanish speakers to learn english than the other way around because english has so many irregularitiesbut one general tip i have for learning any language is minimize translating into your native language in your head learning to understand and use a language is to make it so meaningful to you that there is no need to translate to another one also constantly translating in your head reduces processing speed for the language

742	1	your original comment was kinda vague you didnt really clarify what the mindset youre talking about is so i can only interpret your comment in light of the one you responded to which was about some people who listen to corridos and call themselves rancheros without being able to speak spanish so i thought you were talking about them not speaking spanish i understand what you mean but someone listening to narco corridos doesnt necessarily mean they embrace narc culture just as likely is that they hear those songs and like them and associate them with mexico and there you go some of those songs are really friggin popular so so yea idk you read a lot into a comment that said very little but i understand and appreciate what you mean

795	1	using an egg to heal is part of mexican traditionsuperstition usually a curanderacurandero healer prays over a sick individual who is suffering from various ailments ie fever traumafearanxiety etc and while they are praying they might use holy water herbs or an egg the egg is mainly used to cure ojo or evil eyehow to give someone evil eye its typical that hispanics believe that if you desire something or maybe stare too much at someone that you might unintentionally cause them harm example if you look at a beautiful childinfant you need to touch them in order to prevent them from becoming ill touch their hair their face a hand etc or maybe you like something someone has ie necklace earrings bracelet etc you would have to touch it to prevent it from breaking or becoming lost i think its just the idea that jealousydesireadmiration for something can cause unintentional harm so you must acknowledge your jealousydesireadmiration otherwise you might cause itthe individual harmback to how to cure ojo the curanderoa would pray over the sick individual and rub the egg over their body the egg is then cracked and placed into a glass of water after a certain period of time if the egg floats to the top then you didnt have ojo so obviously that wasnt what was up if the egg sinks then the egg absorbed the ojo that was placed on you and you should be healed

1118	1	frenchman here i speak french english russian and a bit of german spanish and serbian the best way for me to learn english and russian was simply being immersed in them thats why theyre both miles better than my german spanish and serbian i lived in russia for a year when i was young and as a result my russian is better than my serbian or spanish or german will ever be unless i move to places that speak those languages same can be said about my english to a larger extent since ive lived in america almost as long as ive lived in france now if you cant afford to move to a country that speaks the language youre trying to learn i recommend daily practise and classes and trying to find events run by and for people of the speakers of that language i went to a few russian world cup viewing parties here in the states to watch something i love while practising my russian i also recommend watching videos or films or tv programmes in a foreign language maybe ones for children with subtitles at first you have to take baby steps until you can watch films made for teens and adults without subtitles read articles and books in a similar fashion as well if youre younger you could also try language immersion camps theyre a fantastic way to learn a language and the kids in my classes always end up way ahead after they return to school in the autumn if they participated in these camps i hope this helps because the gift of language surpasses many if not most other life skills all the best

1311	1	people back then had so many kids because birth control wasnt as easily to get as it is now that and because they needed help with field work they were too poor to hire people to work their fields atleast thats the answer ive gotten from alot of mexican families including my own
1312	1	that is awesome i respect people trying to teach science on youtube
1313	1	got the reference
1314	1	aw
1315	1	that is a weird way of spelling tamales
1316	1	fair but let me put what i meant a different way the average person wont learn another language other than the ones they learned as kids would you disagree with that i learned spanish at home and when i went to school i learned english im probably not going to learn a third language unless i need to so people whos families have been here two or three generations probably dont speak spanish anymore so their kids wont learn it and they probably wont have much reason to i think its sad but it is what it is so bashing someone of mexican heritage for not  automatically knowing spanish is pretty much bashing for the circumstances into which they were born a lot of the time would someone bash an italian american for not knowing italian usually not right same deal
1317	1	how dare youbacon is part of everything
1318	1	i love three kings day im half guatemalan and since my guatemalan half is black i never really get recognized as latino without an explanation making tamales with my mom or ponche always felt great and im proud to have brought the tradition to my nonlatino friends it started in college everyone was back in town by the 6th so it was perfect and over a decade later we still do it my spanish is terrible but it feels good to still have a connection to my moms culture
1319	1	se puso pendejo y anduvo chingando con que según estadísticas la gente negra adinerada comete más crímenes que hasta la gente  blanca más pobre la estadística real decía que la gente negra de todos los estratos económicos es más perseguida y encarcelada por crímenes que no encarcelan a gente blanca esa fue la madre con la que más dijo investiguen es 100 cierto  tal y como los reclutadores de supremacistas blancos dicen adoran sus estadísticas mal interpretadastambién dijo la mamada de que un país necesita una mayoría demográfica y otras chingaderas que lo dejaban ver muy claro como un pinche racista y la gente se la quiere sacar con ay pero es chistoso y pues de paso lo que dice es cierto y bueno si odiar a los pinches negros es racista pues uy hasta yo soy racista ya de todo se quejan caray malditos sjwborró los tweets y como los había hecho entre temporadas de contenido pues medio se le olvidó a la gente pero por algo ya no toca el tema el wey

1324	1	no but if the oldest sibling helps watching the children mom and dad can work it is still common but it is not elementary grade children it is more around after middle school when some kids stop going to school full time it is not uncommon for young adults to be going into high school i was best friends with 2 girls i was 15 and they were 19 edit grammar

1329	1	theres more to being hispanic than being in the united states spanish aside knowing multiple languages opens your world up to some many other cultures and ideas that arent easily translated speak spanish and travel to puerto rico or mexico or spain or peru youll find the same language but different ideas cultures and history all different but the unifier is you your being able to understand and interact with these places brings brings you a greater understanding of the world around you maybe you dont want to speak and learn spanish for your own reasons but i would counter with this visit another spanishspeaking country maybe even a country youre not associated with and interact with the people i feel that you may find it more rewarding than you initially might think

1367	1	a lot of memes in spanish are made by bilingual people who have been exposed to english memes i imagine a lot of people are like me who grew up in an english speaking country and are fluent in both languages however growing up away from our countries means we didnt receive even middle school education in our native tongue thats why you see a lot of spellinggrammatical errors in a lot of memes that and its a pain in the ass to have your keyboard set for dual languages without it autocorrecting constantly from one language to another

1458	1	i know this is a late reply but it is more of a northern europesouthern europe thing that existed a bit before christianity in northern europe it is colder and there is significantly less daylight in winter sometimes only 28 hours of daylight mainly around germany france britain and scandinavia a tradition developed that around the winter solstice they would celebrate the little amount of daylight there was by eating and drinking lots the drinking is very important when it is that cold and dark which was then incorporated in christianity as christmas day therefore they wouldnt stay up until midnightwhen the protestant reformation happend these northern areas of europe mostly converted so it might seem like a protestantcatholic thing but you can see that catholic areas in northern europe like ireland and i think poland still mostly celebrate on the 25th the 24th is mostly just for getting ready and going to mass

1533	1	no it doesnt really fit saludable has more to do with physical wellbeing it translates directly to healthywhen we say wholesome memes were referring to the second definition of wholesome gtconducive to or promoting moral wellbeingunfortunately i cant think of 1 word that encompasses that definition so well i think the best word would be sano because although it also means healthy as well sano can also meangtque influye de forma favorable o positiva en una personatranslatedgtsomething which influences a person in a favorable or positive mannerfinally because in spanish the adjective goes after the noun and since memes is plural our hypothetical subreddit would be rmemessanos
1534	1	i notice that its always the latinos who dont know spanish that have this huge identity crisis like you do its pretty sad that they dont feel comfortable in their own skin that is why all latino parents should make an effort to teach their kids spanish or whatever other language they can
1535	1	i know exactly what you are talking about dad was hispanic and mom was white i feel like an outsider most of the time to both whites and hispanics its hard to explain for me but you described it well its like we get treated differently because we arent pure it used to bother me but as i grew older i got over it take care my friend

1822	1	i apologize i misread your post i thought i read that you purposefully had parties in your white senile neighborhood to spite themthrowing those sort of parties is ghetto behavior because it totally ignores the people around them its selfish period theres nothing wrong with wanting to have a party but it becomes rude when your neighbors who have their own plans and wants start to hear that unwanted noise why should the enjoyment of one group surpass another group  especially when it involves a live band amps and loud drunk gueststhose people should rent a hall we know they can afford it considering how much it costs to get a tarp the tables and chairs the live band andor dj and not to mention the cost of food and the alcohol if you cant afford a hall then have a party within your means dont even get me started on the parking and these sort of parities are typically held in neighborhoods where parking is already a bitch its just selfish behavior

1893	1	ah ofcourse just needed to say it out loud p
1894	1	well i disagree about black panther and why its popular but anyway i only said it could be like the latino black panther because it could be the chance for a latino superhero to make it big not because itll be exactly the same as black panther his mexican heritage and background will most likely be a part of the film and will influence the story a bit because hes a mexican teen from a city thats mainly hispanic but it doesnt have to be the center piece like it black history and political issues were in black panther here to tell you a bit more about the character  a blue beetle scarab is a weapon that bonds to a host and gives them an exoskeleton armor with different powers thing is that theyre created by an alien species called the reach to help them invade other planets it allows the host to be a hero of their planet for a while to gain the natives trust but the scarabs are programmed to eventually turn on their host and  its planet and become a weapon in the reachs invasion  so green lanterns who are basically space cops who protect their sector of space destroy the things on site there was a scarab that was flying around close to earth and a gl blasted it it didnt destroy it though it broke it and no longer had its invadery tendencies its found by a teenager called jaime reyes and his friends in el paso and it bonds to jaime while hes asleep he struggles for a while to learn how to use his sentient super armor his best friend is in a gang with powered criminals magic based if i remember his other best friend is a girl called brenda who has an aunt who is a narca called la dama that traffics magic stuff and people a story less influenced by his mexican background they could do is the reach finding him and trying to fix his scarab to use him to invade the earth and jaime fighting them

1999	1	like many things he is said im not sure although he has mentioned he wants to support science and technology he has never highlighted the economic importance of it so i dont think it will be a great change from the kind of support weve seen in past administrations which is great support dont get me wrong we have great research grants and scholarships through conacyt but i dont think it will bring out the change i wish to seehowever he has mentioned as well he wants to give much more support to pymes smallandmediumbusinesses and although he hasnt mentioned or implied technology eg by using the term startups instead i think this ultimately will be the proposal that helps the most in this regardi would also love to see a city step up and claim the tech hub title monterrey has a little guadalajara another bit cdmx kind of as well and puebla some too but the networks are small and most of what ive seen are soft products software as a service with few niche users focusing on turning a profit rather than creating change we need physical tangible quality products that people can grab at a supermarket and think wow this is mexican because i know we have it in us

2065	1	it is really just necessity if youre dutch chances are high that you will work in a company that deals with a foreign company since it is so easy in the eu so german or french is a bonus and therefore taught in school you need to pick one and german is easier for them than french like i talked to a recruitment agency for programmers and half of their german staff is just dutchies that moved to germany speaking perfect german with a charming accentenglish is a no brainer because they dont dub anything you have it in school and then youre blasted with english on tv music and the internet a german can comfortably stay in their german internet bubble the dutch internet bubble isnt big enough to avoid english completely in germany a good chunk of people will speak english and have a basic understanding of french latin or spanish it is really not necessary here to speak 3 languages like my gf had french in school she can maybe read a menu in france but that is about it her english is better but she is self conscious she will manage just fine but thinks her english is terrible it is just not perfect but she is totally an english speaker but since she has no exposure thanks to dubs and the internet bubble it also wont get better

2090	1	paris syndrome is what happens to people who forget that paris is an actual city where people live and work and have their vacations ruined because they see a bit of dogshit or graffiti because they find out amélie is not a documentary or because they expect service staff in the most visited city on the planet to always be pleased to see them
2091	1	im a dual us german citizen and have been reading about german immigration to chile and it is quite fascinating  how arewere german immigrates viewed as in chile are they looked at as productive people
2092	1	i mean im sure theres a lot of assholes out there the worst ive heard was the yola comments but youre right ever since the economy has gone to shit we dont joke around anymore  that being said our sport rivalries will forever stand
2093	1	same here bro
2094	1	ha there it is i figured someone would say this not in the mood to argue about who is more in denial about its own imperialism though so ill just cast a vote for the brits and take my leave
2095	1	thats because they are i travel to sa for work and they visit us  most of the people i deal with are dual saeuropean citizens  zidovudine prophylaxis is free in a lot of places but the still have very high hiv rates inter ethnic prejudices also exist with the zulus in the majority  unfortunately  racism seems for open there than other parts of the world  i took the sa clients to a white sox game which is near a large african american community and some of the comments they said were absolutely inappropriate in the west
2096	1	im talking about when they deposed him not when they put him there
2097	1	woah another wild frenchmen appears it seems there are more of us over here than i previously thought
2098	1	mid twenties haha we have our own place in my country so they do know that we share a bed and that were not only playing games and solving puzzles togetheri respect their decision though as we say when in rome
2099	1	nah they pretty chill lol
2100	1	they actually did get it right once in panama when they deposed noriega it is not a great track record but it is not zero
2101	1	lol i expected the answer to be we dont but this is even better haha
2102	1	no it is more like the immigration law in every country in the americas after independence if you managed to reach this soil then you are officialy an americanargentinebrazilian etc nobody pays you
2103	1	im in escazu san jose costa rica right now and its exactly the same i have a very close mexican friend living in tuscon but from sinaloa both of his parents immigrated from greece to mexico and still liver their they are very european looking well off and have no reason to move to the us  ive never been to mexico city but i would love to go to a soccer match in azteca great comment ive a dual germanamerican citizen living in chicago
2104	1	that is a terrible way of playing the realpolitik game international sanctions from the west would mean youll never get to export anything trade embargoes will go up international bank accounts will be frozen the usa would never support such an invasion if they wanted to destroy their diplomatic relations and their soft power they would have already invaded iran  so you can say yeah why will we care about the west when we can just trade with russia and china though youre already trading with russia and china will these countries risk further tensions with the west over bolivia is lithium and how much will they pay when you cant sell it to anyone else anyway will they give incentive to those who destabilized their alliances and harmed their influence in the region everyone usa russia china eu oas would prefer the situation to go away with minimal involvement and in our current century it would mean coordinated sanctions
2105	1	we usually kiss twice in france and some people kiss thrice i dont know how relevant the map is but ive yet to meet a fellow frenchman who only gives one kiss or four
2106	1	what brazilians think of bolsonaro saluting the us flag and encouraging his supporters to chant usa usa usa
2107	1	to be honest i dont understand youre trying to claim if youre trying to claim that latin america is colonial history has no bearing on the present then i would suggest you check out some books on the subject it is not only a historical topic that interest historians but also one that political economists are interested in why nations fail and political order amp political decay are two books that i would recommend the first is general the second is dense and is part of a twovolume set that first looks at how the first societies were structured and developed before delving into why some countries fail and others succeed
2108	1	gracias por las palabras yo al igual que muchos boricuas nos sentimos 100 latinos y celebramos la hermandad que tenemos con otros países especialmente nuestros vecinos antillanos
2109	1	youre seeing one now born and still living on pr i really think we dont see much of us because there is a lot of confusion as whether or not we boricuas are considered latinos maybe a lot of my fellow and sometimes myself dont feel welcomed i think theres a stigma going around because we are technically american citizens even the mods dont give us a flare to represent which is like a spit in the face but thats a topic for another time anyway sorry for the rant hopefully i get to visit your country soon happy to see a neighbor on reddit
2110	1	due to the dutch diseasehttpsenwikipediaorgwikidutch_disease it is usually quite the opposite
2111	1	i get your point and i think youre right youre also wrong  different cultural regions separated by language call things differently in some languages crucially the one were using youre correct in spanish portuguese french italian youre notthere are different continental models the 7 continent model is common in english speaking countries this is the definition used by both national geographic society american the royal geographical society british and oxford germans usually use the same english language model but they sometimes call the americas and eurasia double continents it is also used by arab cultures china and many others making it probably the most popular modelfor latinculture countries it is 6 continents in spanish the 6 continent model is the only one accepted by the real academia española and with the wildly inconsistent suggestion that norteamericano is somehow an acceptable way to refer to people from the united statesthere are other models russians refer to south america and north america as different continents but for them eurasia is a single one this is the one used by eastern europe theyre right between asia and europe so it makes perfect sense and japananyone who thinks their model is the one true model is wrong
2112	1	the accents spoken in the castilles
2113	1	ive yet to meet a french american though theyre usually either italian german irish scottish or all of the above

2115	1	i dont know man we definitely have some rivalry when it comes to boxing or we used to have
2116	1	thats cool i feel the same way about you guys its pretty much friendly teasing and competition i have a couple of dominican friends and the most we talk about is who has the best food and athletesteams
2117	1	oh boy as citizens from an ex colonial empire we can already start polishing our shield
2118	1	love it i would really enjoy the museums and the different neighborhoods
2119	1	this sort of pride leads humanity to its worst insist cooperate insist again otherwise there is no hope  as for a realist argument once you cut off ties unilaterally youre giving away any bargaining power you could have as the usa did with cuba if it didnt work with a superpower vs a tiny country it certainly would do much less for chile vs bolivia
2120	1	absolutely im under the impression that people think time heals everything the legacy of this period still persist
2121	1	no just deposing him its not so hard the comment was the us deposing a dictator has never worked out because what happens next is always worse  my answer was it did work out in panama if the commend had been about intervention in general and not just regime change then id have much better examples
2122	1	is there any sense of connection to las islas canarias in cuba
2123	1	httpstwittercomviktorbirstatus1066116734988488704the girl in white behind the sitting white bearded man next to the other white bearded man is dominican she also officially is india that is the skin colour
2124	1	its not social democracy thats for sure its even on the wiki as not to be confused with socialism or democratic socialismif you think social democracy is socialism then this conversation is over since that would be a hilarious claim
2125	1	so essentially your response to what im saying is to engage in a logical fallacy im not going to respond back to this since it is a dead end
2126	1	whats more common to know in brazil spanish or english
2127	1	yeah we try well some of us
2128	1	gt very soon our economy will overtake puerto rico is  slow down there supreme leader snoke that very well might be but my mofongo will forever be better than that weak ass mangú  and theres nothing you can do about it checkmate gt we dont need sports you can have it i can suddenly hear the disappointment of millions of sport fans around the world guess dr doesnt want its ass kicked by pr next world classic

2131	1	cool my gf is canaria and talks often of her family in cuba and of the similarities in food and drink
2132	1	gt in fairness you cant just decide youre something and have that be the caseif he decides that he is colombian americanlatino because that is his heritage or whatever then that is it it is not my place or anyone else is to say that he isnt or is and i dont think latin americans are exclusionary i only find that people on the internet tend to find corners of the internet where they become more radical or strong in their beliefs it surprises me here that people think that people and their children who or come to the united states or their children cant call themselves their former nationality or take the nationality of their parents ive found that americansim using this in the broadest sense to mean everyone from the america is are open about identity in parts of europe it is the opposite national identity according to the extreme right is only conferred through blood
2133	1	gt bolivia is the fastest growing country in south america id say they are doing something righti dont think that has any bearing on a politician taking their countries institutions and constitution and ripping it to pieces from a moral perspective if he is not supposed to run then he shouldnt if he wants the best for his country then he should respect his countries institutions from an economic perspective nothing scares away outside investors then uncertainty and rules that arent followed
2134	1	i was expecting chile to be different from costa rica on this topic thank you for your comment
2135	1	what interventions happened in venezuela exactly
2136	1	none i just said they compare it to other less fortunate parts of latam

2138	1	this subreddit is in no way shape or form representative of your nation or culture this reddit like many places on the internet including europe or askeurope reddit which inspired this reddit attracts the kind of people who have exclusionary beliefs that shouldnt surprise anyone it is the internet
2139	1	yeah thats one of the clearest ones try rural extremadura or andalucia
2140	1	gtno they are idiots trying to feel special sums up how i feel about the morons that say shit like im irish that is why i drink like a retarded or im 1124 french that is why im smelly and flamboyant
2141	1	in my opinion associating industrialization with development is wrong even more so considering that today most of the countries have postindustrial economies
2142	1	same thing in panama
2143	1	yo te bailo una salsa buena jaja
2144	1	nah were here we just dont get a cool ass flair
2145	1	nice
2146	1	ah sim em geral as pessoas não fazem perguntas sobre suas origens nas primeiras interações exceto quando elas percebem algo que dê a entender que você é estrangeiro comigo o assunto acaba surgindo apenas mais tarde e aí sou bombardeado com perguntas e algumas pessoas acham que estou zoando com elas
2147	1	so it is more acceptable if the couple stay at the guy is place rather than the girl is
2148	1	theyre just fantastic at least 50 of the reason i wanna live in brasil is capybaras
2149	1	the thing is though i wish my countrycommonwealth would be independent i feel a strange feeling of indifference towards statehood or the overall status quo all i know is that this back and forth between statehood and independencesovereignty is what has lead to the corruption of the government people are too preoccupied with what the government is doing and not why its allowed in the first place we need to make up are minds and do it quickly because i strongly believe anything will be better than the us keeping us as a stepchild give us statehood or give us independence no in between its getting out of hand that being said i feel pr isnt prepared for independence at least not with its current economic status we would need new ways to import export merchandise and not to mention the turismo that once was thriving now all people hear is that is a wasteland due to the hurricane which is not true the same could be said for statehood the economy is so broken and the corruption is so high that trump wouldnt even entertain the idea of pr becoming a state the increased taxes would break us until the current economy starts to turn positive i feel its a no show for nowtldr  i feel we should have made up our minds a long time ago for the status quo but we should be allowed to pick wether to be state or independent no in between
2150	1	no he is not the previous governments are responsible for what macri is dealing with as well as brazil thankfully lula is in jail and that old witch is impeached
2151	1	the way op has worded it all islands would be exclaves
2152	1	im going to ignore the first two comments since they have no bearing on what is being discussed moral is not being used in the sense of good and evil im saying it is morally wrong from the perspective that it would be better to take the high route and respect the rule of law political stability certainty and consistency is much better than another strongman type which is what happens to many developing countries costa rica is a good example of a country that did that following its civil war with the military choosing constitutional order rather than trying to rule and it is a large reason why it has been prosperous and stable im going to disagree with the legislative and judicial parts venezuela is other branches agree with the executive because theyve been filled with yesmen morales does the same thing
2153	1	im surprised at how much you assume i said with how little ive actually said ill try this one last time  gt the us has never deposed a democratically elected or shit not even elected leader and had it gone right   they just replace them with puppets who harm the populace as much as any dictator would this statement you made is the only thing im answering to im not talking about their involvement in panama in general of previous historical context of us foreign policy weapon supply drug war im just confined to this one statement which involves none of that and is a very specific statement of fact that is either correct or incorrect  if you still stand by what i quoted then i ask did the us get it wrong by deposing noriega yesno if yes then what is the name of the puppet who replaced noriega
2154	1	to put it shortly my mum is brazilian she moved here on her own so she is the only one in the brazilian side of the family that speaks french realising that such a language barrier would alienate me from half of my family my parents decided that i was to be raised billingual eis que o plano foi um sucesso e aqui estamos nós
2155	1	whoops youre right
2156	1	i think what op meant by opposite is that rich countries in order to reach their current level of development have taken opposite measures to those traditionally advocated in brazil by entreguistas that is instead of eating the panacea of liberalism and expecting for all the solutions to come from it these countries adopted protectionist measures whenever necessary to protect nascent industries and only embraced the free market once they had reached a certain level of development
2157	1	this is pure whataboutismhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiwhataboutism but it misses the point entirelyangela merkel is allowed by her country is constitution to stand for as many elections as she pleases it is a parliamentary system anyway so they cant be compared directly fdr was also allowed by his constitution and this was changed shortly after his death the us now has a 2 term limit  democracy requires rule of law disregarding this is by definition a negation of democracy multiple terms are not inherently antidemocratic the problem is the arbitrary use of power democracy does not mean electionsevo morales lost a referendum that would have allowed him to stand for reelection he decided to ignore the referendum and do it anyway any and all possible legitimacy for the upcoming elections has already been lost
2158	1	gtnot my fault i voted for ciro você não é a primeira pessoa que vejo dizer isso seria uma boa ideia fazer umas camisas com essa frase iria vender bem gt não é minha culpa votei no ciro milhões de pessoas 2018

2161	1	apparently france is farright is socialist in the bolsomito scale so yeah chilean right wingers are fullblown commies
2162	1	by social democrats so not socialists social democrats believe in free markets and are not socialists so yes chile is successful thanks to social democracy
2163	1	gttrue but industrialization is usually the natural path to getting to a postindustrial economynothing prevents you from skipping stepsgti am only aware of one exception and that is australianew zealand and to a lesser extent norway are two other examplesgtmaybe like you say today the path for argentina is differentthe path for argentina is the same for any other country free market protection of intellectual property investment in rampd sovietstyle industrialization is a thing of the past
2164	1	what conclusions can we draw from this chart
2165	1	i see thanks for your comment funny how a lot of parents from latinamerica dont want their children to have sex under their roof though that is like the safest place to do it after all
2166	1	exactly what i thought
2167	1	independence for central america according to the teachers because most of the fathers we from there and the first movement was there that is not my opinion only how it is teachedyes we still have some to our days in the west side the pipil are aztec descendants who immigrated and built their own civilization

2301	1	i care
2302	1	what are you talking about those countries get lumped together all the time here in the us they are known as the anglo world there kind of like our brothers and sisters latin america the anglo world and the arab world are kind of big communities that share alot of the same stuff just regional differences basically

2307	1	have you ever lived in venezuela or are you just coming up with the assumption that it was better in which senses though i really want to know
2308	1	eh youre also doing some really ridiculous historic revisionism the military dictatorship did improve the quality of life in a lot of ways during that time literacy rate unlike what your comment seems to imply actually improved a lot by the end of the dictatorship as they some really aggressive antiilliteracy programs such as mobralhttpsptwikipediaorgwikimovimento_brasileiro_de_alfabetizac3a7c3a3oand mind you most of the economic problems that the dictatorship faced were inherited from the previous government still that does mean they failed to solve it but so did a couple of elected presidents before the plano realoverall they probably did more bad than good but painting them as literally hitler is very disingenuous
2309	1	i never said anything about it in latin america overall and obviously in that context people who are into the rock or metal music scene would understand
2310	1	its an issue thats not well reported in english media but there is a narrative that puertoricans dont want statehood that is usually pushed by conservatives polls indicate that a slight majority favor statehood but 2 out of three major parties who favor the status quo always boycotts the referenda so that they can discredit the result when it inevitably goes against them edit i should add its also my understanding and this could be overly simplistic that the majority of the minority against statehood dont actually prefer the status quo they prefer independencedevolution over statehood
2311	1	chapo is a socialist podcast like 35 of usual members are fucking dsa members

2313	1	how is generalizing wrong of course many latin american countries have major differences but we are all basically catholics influenced by spainportugal so it is expected that we kinda similar to a certain extent japan korea and china are not the same but they have a history of sharing religions of buddhism and confucianism sharing foods sharing culture and language so it is okay to generalize to a certain extent for example education is very important in those asian countries

2339	1	you would have to be more descriptive about plantains for example plátano verde is a green plantain or plátanos maduros are fried sweet plantains
2340	1	gdp doesnt really mean what you think it means it can simply mean that rich people are just industrializing a lot how much of that money actually goes back to workers is ommitedgdp per capita is better but doesnt tell the full story actual economic growth or poverty rates are a better measurement of a healthy and moral economy chiles economy was neither of those things under pinochetoh and did you forget why the chicago boys were formed literally the biggest economic depression in chilean history right under pinochets nose under allende there would be no chicago boys because they wouldnt have had a catastrophic failure of the economy despite literal subversion and heavy heavy sanctions from one of their strongest trading partners in america
2341	1	i dont want to be offensive but you sound like economy is not your best sideallende left chile with 80 poverty pinochet left it with 45 and gdp skyrocketinghttpwwwignacioflorescomimagesrwages1970pnghttpsencryptedtbn0gstaticcomimagesqtbnand9gcque9ra1yrad7uhj38dj6oh5eixdnwifjkcgkcajwu7yrtqorhthe 1980 crisis was a global crisis you can see in the graph that the average gdp per capita of la did fall too chile is gdp fell even more due the cu is price dropthe chicago boys model remained intact way after pinochet until the reforms  of the bachelet is 2nd governmentthe allende is economic policies had the expected results property rights violation fixed prices wage rises inorganic money intentions exchange control the same combo has been applied dozens of times with the same results who the fuck would expect something different

2346	1	gthow have i benefited from that alleged theftgo live for two years in bolívia and youll understandbut in one thing you are quite correct brazilians are to blame for ellecting people who lick american bootsalso you obviously dont know anything about latin american industrialization and who actually benefits from it so ill avoid this topic

2357	1	to be fair as a yank and a music nerd i would group my brazilian music in a completely different folder from latin music and wouldnt consider them anywhere near the same family tree

2362	1	in daily discussion or news it really isnt your country is far more relevant to us in almost every sensein terms of business china has become one of our main partners if im not mistakenthis is not to say that people dont know trump and other public figures from the us but thats because of their global reach outside of that the us really isnt part of discussion or commerce

2373	1	thanks for pointing that out
2374	1	people also always forget to mention that the rebel groups that the military government fought were explicitly trying to install a marxistleninist dictatorship in brazil not democracy as some people often think brazil probably wouldnt become a new cuba without military intervention but you can argue that after it it could very well have turned into one if it wasnt for the military repression of these groupsthere is a good article at super interessantehttpssuperabrilcombrespeciais21mitossobreaditaduramilitar in portuguese about myths of that period explaining that this image of rebels as defenders of democracy was invented well after the fact
2375	1	dude venezuela is gdp has fallen 50 in a couple of years do you know how does that lookit looks like thousands of babies dying due starvation and lack of medicines it looks like living with 7 per month it looks like millions of peoples starving it looks like 10 of the population fleeing in a couple of years that is something never seen in our hemisphere

2377	1	not only are you wrong but are you seriously bringing up the economy from 60 years ago the periodo especial of the 90s after the collapse of the soviet union is a more relevant comparison

2400	1	yes and no yes because we are taught that the natives were wiped out due to war and disease shortly after the spanish arrived but at the same time it wasnt really a surprise because we are also taught that the spanish men brought no women along so they took the native women as wives ie raped them so it made sense for there to be some remnants of that their children didnt just disappear i always figured there had to be some mixture somewhere because theres no way for people to live side by side for generations and not mix with each other
2401	1	not everything is more expensive for example most electronics are much much cheaper in the us or canada than they are here brazil a few years ago it was literally cheaper to buy a flight to miami pay a hotel for 1 day and buy a ps4 or a iphone there and then come back then it was buying a ps4 or a iphone here currently thanks to the high price of the dollar this is no longer the case because of the price of the flight and the hotel but things are still much cheaper even taking into account the price of the dollar a chevrolet camaro costs around 40k in the us according to google here is costs around 70k in dollars after making the conversionso yeah things like food and rent are much cheaper here in brazil most consumer goods are much cheaper in the us

2405	1	thanks
2406	1	i think that people from caracas and maracaibo do that more often
2407	1	no because of repression it is the typical cant even swear in the house or talk about sex and drugs are the devil so the kids living in that environment rebel against it and go overboard it is why even the most educated and richest statesprovinces have even more drug issues at times it is like here drinking per capita is much lower because we are relaxed about it and when kids start drinking many times in family events it is not a big deal over there the conservatism leads to all their issues with that which is repressed for example latin america well many of the countries within it rank highest amongst most regular sex the us and uk also rank highly but psychological issues stemming from unfulfilling sexual relationships and other such things are much more common over there cocaine consumption per capita in brasil is not so far off the us it is also one of the more conservative countries in south america but overdose rates are far lower it is why you get many more crazy sjw people over there while social movements and feminist movements are also popular here but lesscrazy

2410	1	it makes me wonder if you ask the name of 5 african countries to the average brazilian they will probably mention those who have a decent football team
2411	1	it literally means fag but context matters young people tend to use it as a dude sort of word old people on the other hand take the literal meaning and only use it with offensive intent
2412	1	i dont care

2419	1	the colombian military is the second largest in the western hemisphere in terms of active personnel behind the united states armed forces
2420	1	this is true but the us government has time and time again supported the status quo option this is also the reason why it is unresolved people in the island believe that being a territory is a dignified acceptable option this is unacceptable and the us should officially reject thisthe status quo shouldnt be an option why do they back it because that way they wont risk dealing with a referendum resulting in statehood as the majority the us only benefits if pr stays a territory or becomes independent but not a state
2421	1	yeah you double it i know a perez perez a lopez lopez etc

2429	1	yes i agree he can decide it but his deciding it isnt worth anything if no one in colombia considers him colombian its a bit like an unattractive person deciding that theyre incredibly attractive well thats fine and all but if everyone else treats you as unattractive and you know that they consider you unattractive how much does it matter at that point you have to ask whether youre a little delusional americans are the opposite because the americas are not homogenous there is no distinct american ethnicity and american culture is  comparatively at least  a nascent culture in america a vietnamese man that was neither born or raised in america can become american not solely in legal terms but in every aspect of identity in europe and asia distinct ethnicities exist a vietnamese man that was neither born or raised in europe can become european legally but  for the majority at least  will in a certain sense remain noneuropean

2450	1	lol the real question is central america communist or socialist
2451	1	wikipedia says the cardinals are his fav team and that he grew up a cardinals fan
2452	1	that is because he knows how to play politics in the us and going against hillary clinton was a huge benefit in his direction he can be attacked on his businesses and personal life but since this was his first serious run for office he did not have any political baggage to hit him on and bringing up political failures is a good way to attack a politician but for the most part he had very few political baggage things to strike him for hillary clinton is somebody who had years of political baggage to attack she would also alienate people on her side with pretty blatant lies and policy switches so the choice was a politician in the most negative sense of the word or your above average businessman   in the most negative sense of the phrase people in the us dislike politicians so the above average businessman is president and he is doing kind of how i thought he would be doing
2453	1	you do know that with your american passport russia would probably welcome you with open arms right and there is a process to denounce your american citizenship if you dislike it so much honestly most americans dont want anything to do with puerto rico and in my humble experience neither do most people from other latin countries who have met puerto ricans all the puerto ricans i have ever met tend to look at other latinos as inferior

2501	1	it didnt go right by the simple fact that he was in power only because the us put him in power but lets ignore that lets zoom into your extremely myopic point youre unnaturally fixated onaround 3000 innocents died in the invasion of panama that wouldnt have died had we just not put him in power again ignore that second sentencethe puppet the us put into power was ultimately very unpopular and did little to actually lift panama i dont know about you but for something to go right for me thousands of innocents have to not die fighting for a dictator the liberating country placed oh and the new person put in charge should atleast be someone the people want

2509	1	definitely more culturally conservative trying saying hi to someone with a kiss most progressive laws of western countries are illegal be it drugs in most states where it is heavily criminalized prostitution and gay marriage was legalized recently drinking in public is illegal and strongly enforced militarized police sexuality has the duality of liberal but also immoral how people talk censorship you can even tell in how cold the people are that is from a conservative culture social aids and such are heavily frowned upon look at the differences in how they celebrate holidays and especially religious ones people in many latino countries drink and party imagine telling a gringo that christmas is for getting together with the family to drink whiskey and dance the left is stronger here which points towards cultural liberalism it is not even close how much more culturally conservative they are it is like speaking to a puritan robot alcohol selling stores close before ten at night in most counties there are counties where selling alcohol is illegal imagine a gringo going out telling his parents im going out to get drunk compare the way people dress bars close at around 1 in the morning in most places new york los angeles and san fransisco are not the entirety of the us in fact they sum 15 of the population even boston where i lived is very conservative cambridge isnt all of boston all the rest like the surroundings towns are very conservative in massachusetts one of the most liberal states again it is not even close

2513	1	theyre hypocrites dont listen to their nonsense its great that youre in touch with our taíno roots i became interested too in my taína roots after i took  one of those dna tests and i was surprised when i found out that i was native american too cubans have been brainwashed to think we dont have any connection to the native people of our land its honestly really sad
2514	1	besides nationalization well we have over regulation of businesses by imposing and dictating the prices by decree labor inmobility you cant fire any employee by law no matter what if you rent a house or apartment you cant raise the rent even when with the highest inflation rate in the planet nor ask them to leave once the contract in over you cant trade currency unless you do it at the price set by the government which is sometimes thousands of times lower than the market value the justice system is openly in favor of the government party and will never go against it you cant even legally publish the price you want to sell your used car if you have a factory and you close it it will be taken over by the government and you will lose everything you own you cant sell food above the prices fix by the government and if you do you might end up in jail isnt the socialist system fantastic
2515	1	actually there is no legal way or procedure to to build a military base in venezuela in the first place the constitution forbids it directly in the 13th article my own translationarticle 13 omiting the non related parts that basically say that no part of the territory can be given in any way temporary or permanently to any other country allowing only the creation of their embassiesthe venezuelan geographic space is a peace area no foreign military bases or any instalation with military purposes in any way can be stablished by any foreign power or coalition of powers

2522	1	gti had never heard of that onecome on its quite popular look it up in google pleasegtcompletely different contextdid you read past that you can say things and they can mean a thousand things to you but your personal set of beliefs and morals doesnt change the meaning of the words said they do carry meaning regladless of your intentionsgti am notyou said it yourself black slaves were considered property and they belonged to someone how am i supposed to take that but i get it times change and things dont mean the same they used to plus the spanish language have no other way of calling blacks other than negro or at least a convenient way youre right on thatgtbecause i dont use it nobody i know uses it and i dont agree with it oh well ive heard it a thousand times claiming ignorance is null it is a popular phrase in our venezuela maybe your particular enviroment dont use it but it is a phrase used by our regular joe we as a society see white as better than brown or blackgtnow what about reverse racismyou are agreeing with me im kind of white too i was pale as fuck now more tanned and ive suffrered all of that you said they discriminated you because of your skin color that is textbook racism and why use reverse racism racism is universal to all its not an exclusive thing to whitesgtwords by themselves lack meaningno they do carry weight words always mean something we can go on like this for several other replies but i have one question before that you say venezuela is not racist then why this study alongside others have said otherwise

2528	1	now if he goes to colombia and only visits medellín and bogotá he is gonna have the same experience but you know the opposite also happens i live in canada now and back in colombia everyone thinks that canada is like this paradise where money rains from the skies and everyone is very polite and friendly where crime is nonexistent and if youre unhappy is because you have depression
2529	1	i would just call it economically conservative such as private business but more culturally conservative as latin america ehhh no
2530	1	false the economy is heavily regulated you cant choose to price things freely most companies are owned by the state
2531	1	deve ser pessoa de bem não esperava menos

2533	1	he makes great points youre the one trying to put a cruel totalitarian regime under good light for whatever reason that is kinda messed up
2534	1	i guess that is true as well part of the problem of arguing what i want to is that latin america is less homogeneous then the us you have uruguay on one side for example and honduras on the other even vermont and alabama dont differ as wildly although i could also argue in favor of population as central america isnt so populous and panama and costa rica are very south american in many ways especially panama that used to be a part of colombia the caribbean is also conservative in general north east brasil is more like the caribbean hen south and south east brasil south brasil is like the southern cone south east brasil is its own thing although minas gérais is crazy similar to andean colombia which is most of the country in population and almost by extension i mean just bogotá and medellin in metro area sum 33 of the population of my country and those two are liberal cali is similar and it is the third most populous buenos aires being liberal almost decides a liberal argentina so yeah in sum i guess mexico might be a big exception south america though in general is much more liberal then the us
2535	1	well i never said there is is no racism in uruguay actually i think there are many racist people over herei was pointing out the few black people from uruguay i knew

2540	1	in fairness you cant just decide youre something and have that be the case even nonnationalists would generally agree that someone that wasnt either born in x country raised in x country or born to parents from x country isnt from x country thats a pretty common sentiment the world over i am a bit surprised at the extent to which latin americans are exclusionary i assumed they be more similar to the us in relation to identity
2541	1	gt what do you think they raped millions of women that is such a myth  source
2542	1	i dont know if i agree that they are different dialects i wouldnt call british english and american english different dialects
2543	1	doesnt matter if not all most are and that is enough at least ignorant in that sense
2544	1	oh i did make a point but ill tell you why you cant understand it because of the kind of murican you are another selfabsorbed stinky condescending liberal who likes to spew their holierthanthou antiimperialist rhetoric all over the web while swimming in the spoils of the very same imperialism in fact imperialist propaganda is so encrusted in your soul and your being that you wouldnt be able to differentiate between your thoughts and the orders of your handlerspeople like you will never understand anything about life that is why i dont give two flying fucks about your patronizing jibberjabber or that of any other muricangtkeep blaming those evil americans for all of your problemsi never actually did that but then again it suits your selfcentered murican rhetoric

2597	1	hey great question its a litle bit more complex than that umbanda have diferent influences one of it is the influence os kardec spiritism we believe in reincarnation and that we live with lots of spirits together with us some of them are lost some of them are in low vibration and some of them are trying to evolve and there are also good evolved spirits that try to help mankingto work in umbanda the spirits have to work by the divine principles and the principal principle is charity to help others as a result of having love as a directionso there are diferent lineages of spirits in umbanda that we call falanges phalanges or phalanx for each lineage theres a line of work and esch work has a way of helping people so the pretos velhos phalange or lineage theyre know to be very wise spirits who suffered a lot while they where living people and they learned from the suffering and now they live in a very good place vibrating a very good energy very near from oxalá jesus christits important to notice that not necessarily the preto velho was a slave spirit some of them really was but not every one of the preto velho is a lineage of work and they put something like a spirit dressing to work by that lineage so some of them could have passed to other things in life not necessarily they were slaves but now they work as pretos velhos in diferent cultures they can assume diferent forms so this way they can be better understood by diferent cultures around the world thats why in brazil they assume the archetypal image of slaves i dont know if i am being clear but theres a good example of thiswhen umbanda was only being creates the first umbanda medium went to a kardec spiritism house in brazil rio de janeiro to ask for help because spirits was coming to him and they were wanting something that he couldnt understand so when he went to the kardec center people saw that he have two spiritual dressingswe call roupagem one was of a medieval priest and below that he was a caboclo indian this was diferent images from diferent encarnations that the spirit have in this earth this spirit was the caboclo from 7 crossroads the founder of umbandado having explained all that ze pelintra was true person he lived in pernambuco a state of brazil he was a malandro a typical figure of brazil and he lived in sin as many chatolic saints and his spirit became part of umbanda as he went indocrinated and learn t work with the divine spiritual side now he uses his knowledge from the human life to help people he is a exu that means in yoruba sphere why sphere the sphere is always moving always in movement exu is transformation exu takes lifes out of stagnationso ze pelintra founded a phalange a lineage theres lots of spirits that work in the lineage of ze pelintra because they work in the archetype of trickery and of knolodge of street life but not all spirits that work as ze pelintra name was the true ze pelintra in the spiritual world our human identities are not that important they can share knowlodge and they can work in diferent lineages as they evolvei hope i was clear and helped to dissipate myths thanks for the question

2632	1	gt  that has a whole fucking culture around ethnicity i never understand when people say this could you expound on what you meanwhy does anyone expect a first or second generation asianamerican to resemble a white or black american whose ancestors have lived in america for about 200 years my koreanamerican friend is just as american as i am with respect to work ethic and beliefs about education things we learned mostly in school but she doesnt cook the same food as me and doesnt really celebrate christmas or thanksgiving because her parents are from korea  my vietnameseamerican friend is just as american as i am but her family cooks different food than mine and my koreanamerican friend and also doesnt celebrate thanksgiving and christmas theyre not korean and vietnamese by citizenship and theyre not 100 korean and vietnamese culturally but theyre also not 100 culturally american either to ignore that is insensitiveour ways of interacting with our parents differ the language we use in the household differs views on marriage and childbearing differ and how these are negotiated in the family wildly differ expectations on what professions they should have differ not because of their race or ethnicity but uniquely because their parents didnt move an ocean away for their children to become poor artists the neighborhoods that we lived in as children differed the grocery stores and food we bought differed as wellthere are also different demographic advantages and disadvantages to be acknowledged my koreanamerican friends are almost always more economically well off than my vietnameseamerican friends because of the history behind why and how koreans and vietnamese people arrive in americawhenever latin americans talk about the us being this monolithic culture that is obsessed with ethnicity it makes me wonder just how much they must not understand how immigrant cultures work anywhere in the world with respect to integration and assimilation the number of asian americans whose ancestors have been here for more than a century is dwarfed by the amount of asian americans who are the first of their family to be born on us soilare we obsessed with ethnicity well only as obsessed as necessary to differentiate two elementary schoolers with histories lifestyles and cultures that were probably worlds different just a generation ago by way of their parents

2641	1	gtwhy is so hard for you to understand that being democratically elected is not the same than being democraticfirst of all being democratic literally means supporting democracy and its principles chavez did that multiple times by allowing reelections allende also did that and made no moves to make the country less democratic so in that sense allende was 100 democratic and so is chavez youre so offbase its not even funny anymore dudeyou know what isnt respectful of democracy and its principles killing democratically elected leaders of other countries and replacing them with nondemocratic dictators thats not democratic at all the only reason allendes government struggled financially was sanctions that choked the country into stagnation by the nixon administration even with those sanctions chile under allende was doing better economically httpsenmwikipediaorgwikicrisis_of_1982 lt the largest economic crisis experienced in chile happened under your favorite dictatorial maniac  augusto pinochet this was actually fucking catastrophic to the chilean economy and anything allende ever did is a fucking fraction of the disaster this wasgtare you marxist or whatno im a socialist i dont need to ask if youre a fascist i got my answer when you endorsed the killings of democratically elected officialsgtwe have dozens of marxist governments in the human history and none of them workedyup they didnt work based off of their own merits and not countries like the us literally invading them or backing coup detats to remove democratically elected leaders and subsequently replacing them something not working because of outside factors hindering it doesnt mean it doesnt workeuropeans in 1440  no country has ever functioned without feudalismamericans in 1860  no country has ever functioned without feudalismamericans in 2018  no country has ever functioned without capitalismsee how nonsensical these arguments areif you look at history this myopically and analyze events by only happened and very conveniently ignore the context that lead to these events and how they relate to todays reality youre going to get embarassed in every conversation you have by an 18 year old with only a basic understanding of marxist history you wouldnt look at a billboard thats two feet infront of you with a magnifying glass take a few steps back and actually listen to what youre saying you might get something out of actually knowing what youre talking about its nice

2644	1	no he shouldnt have because as much as youre arguing in english you were able to identify which country he was from the demonym works because it is not regardless of the language it is language dependent and as a speaker of 2 languages you know that american in english estadounidense in spanish and something totally different in chineseamerican as a demonym for all people in the americas is unintelligible and incorrect  in englishand i dont understand why this demonym is so hot to you when this subreddit refuses regional and cultural identifiers latin american means nothing were so diverse south american no were all different but american now that is one i can get behind i am also american
2645	1	i wouldnt say that youre wrong per se i just think that youre overstating the affects of assimilation even though legal segregation has ended the us never really took wide spread measures to reverse segregation american schools are just as segregated now as they were during jim crowe it is just economic forces instead of legal ones causing the separation

2662	1	why would the day of the dead parade be offensive it made it look pretty cool
2663	1	gt the average black american and white american for example even if they live in the same city and are of the same economic class will probably not have quite the same interests there is a reason certain activities are known as white people things there are things that black people do that white people dont do certain shows and music are favored depending on the group etc someone like taylor swift is not going to be popular amongst middle class or any class really black people as rap music is heavily favored by black people regardless of class though some of the artists black people listen to are not highly known outside of black peoplei dont 100 agree with you here since the mid to late 2000s mainstream music and general activities have become increasingly shared between ethnic and racial groups in urban areas and urbanization has also been increasing in the us i think these facts would have been most true in the 70 is90 is but just like immigrant assimilation and integration the difference between white and black america socially is decreasing as were now 23 generations removed from segregationi am not commenting on the closing of educational and economic gaps that is more complicated what i do think is that you cant really call hiphop and rap black music anymore it is heavily consumed by everyone and has been adopted into all genres

2754	1	gtcumulative and linear and then youd be missing time factors in there but its percentileim not sure what you mean by that all i know is that you keep posting about  growth rate possibly out of its correct context i just applied its formula to an analogy to show you that  growth rate is vacuous and statistically misleading without contextall a  growth rate tells us is how the country is doing in relation to itself at some previous point in time maybe though not well it can tell us how it is growing in relation to a very similar country what it isnt telling us are all of the important details of that growth how did it happen is it sustainable will the policies that led to it eventually dip is this the naturalbackground growth rate does that growth rate translate to a lessening of inequality there is a lot of interpretation

2756	1	the concept of noble savage isnt what im talking about kadiweu dont have a word for lie as well they dont have one for sea because they never have had contact with this things it doesnt means they are noble they conquer other tribes and was a civilization based upon war in the specific case of kadiweu theirs belic way of life kept them safe from the portuguese menace therefore they are the opposite of noble and killed all the portugueses that tried to reach the kadiweu land and i have to be team kadiweu on thismeanwhile portugueses traded mirror for diamonds with all the other brazilian native people  which are dead or living poorly right nowso we should put the figure of the great conquer on his place they are actually the great genocide and his weapons was lies and germstheres a sad case of anhanguera that means spirit of evil in tupi which was a portuguese so bad that get into history when he put fire in a bottle of alcohol and told to all native people that hed do the same with the rivers if they refuse to give him all the diamonds and goldim pretty sure the jeitinho is one of the gifts from portugal to his beloved colony

2783	1	why is so hard for you to understand that being democratically elected is not the same than being democratic a tyrant can be democratically elected like chavez or allendewe have dozens of marxist governments in the human history none of them were democratic actually all them were highly authoritarian allende included whysomehow you are falling to see that marxism is inherently authoritarian all empiric evidence makes it extremely obviousare you marxist or whatand the char you posted is meaningless because allende didnt ruled from 1970 to 1980 he ruled from 1970 to 1973 basically you are trying to diguise the terrible performance of allende with the frist economic boom triggered by pinochet is economic reforms
2784	1	not surprised you want to keep on using fossil fuels
2785	1	no this is how adults think about racial and historic reality even if every single spaniard that came in the initial military invasions before the migrations was a rapist it is literally impossible for them to have caused the mestizaje in latin america god you even write like a child it is such idiocy to attribute migratory and sociological racial mixing to such a reductionist and myth littered concept it is incredibly relevant to the history of the region how spain is history as a mixture of so many peoples iberian tribes romans celts germans moors africans carthage and such was influential in their capacity for assimilation and not having the racist extermination concepts the english had for example it is relevant to such a degree that it caused the marriage of spaniards to indigenous noble women and the proud acceptance of the local heritage something that did not happen with the english and french read primary documents for example of bartolomé de las casas even in his anti spanish writings of the cruel treatment of the natives he doesnt go to that degree or el inca garcilaso de la vega actually read something instead of using uneducated ignorant myths there is an enormous amount of literature about the colony period in the latino countries the spanish system of founding towns and the integration to the local encomienda next thing youll tell me the pyramids of egypt were built by slaves it is not sad it is bloody realistic it is not even mathematically possible and there is not only no evidence to support the notion but there is evidence to support the opposite notion which is the mestizaje that occurred in the region was in it is majority not caused by rape but instead by the integration caused by indirectdecentralized colonization in a region which for a long time was only spanish in name bloody read how does one get so much confidence to speak about something that you have clearly never studied even at a bare minimum level it is as if i walked into a room of nuclear engineers to tell them they are wrong without having read anything on the subject just on pure arrogance and confidence

2799	1	eh it is a good index to compare developing countries its simplicity means they can calculate the development of even wartorn regions with very little data available like eastern congoi dont think it is so good when comparing developed countries either that or there are diminishing returns the difference between a country with a 0650 score vs one with a 0700 are huge and you can clearly tell which is more developed but it is difficult when it is between 0900 and 0950it also seems better if you simply separate developed and developing countries because according to the hdi argentina is as developed as portugal but when you actually visit both countries you can tell it really isnt

2877	1	agree its kind of a scale im brazilian from an italian family living in new york and it required a certain adaptation to deal with the lack of warmth and closeness in my experience in ny people are generally more civil and respectful but distant and colder feels a tad more formal while back home everything is pure spontaneity for example the microrelationships here those less intimate everyday contacts such as work colleagues or people you meet on the street naturally have a level of distance and mindfulness of limits and of other peoples space while in brazil there are no spaces  intimacy and closeness are given on any relationship be it your boyfriend or the bank clerk i love this brazilian trait i miss it lot but i also love how civil and respectful people are here in general and also having space feels goodbut im sure that inside the us you have very different cultures in this sense that ny tends to me more distant and individual while other regions are much warmer just like in europe you can find both behaviors makes senseif id have to make a scale from what i lived and people ive met in the three continents i would believe that in general latam tends to be warmer and europe tends to be less with us in the middle hope it doesnt sound prejudicial to anyone im actually curious to see other peoples opinions

2926	1	only about 10 to 15 of taiwans population is descended from the chinese dictators followers who arrived after wwii the large majority of taiwanese are descendants of taiwanese are descendants of chinese settlers who began arriving in the 1600s after the dutch created a fort there taiwan was more like south america than north america in that there was a lot of intermarriage with and assimilation of the aboriginal population as compared to north america where the aborigines were more often driven out or eliminated

2950	1	what i find funny is that people are offended when americans or nonlatinos use the giant sombrero and poncho when that is actually part of mexican culture but somehow portraying us as all brown with thick accents is just representation if you actually live in mexico you know that on september 15th everyone wears the same over the top sombrero and fake mustache no matter how dark or how white they are the mustache is a grey area it is not inherently part of mexican culture but i guess it is just iconic

3030	1	you literally said thisthey raped the women which produced mestizosin response to me saying that the spanish and natives resulted in mestizos so you literally implied that mestizaje is a result mostly of the spanish raping the natives that is how argumentation works yes the spanish raped a bunch of natives the natives raped a bunch of people rape hasnt exactly been eradicated from the region so clearly that was not your intent to say there were some cases of rape but just as a stand alone point your implication as a counter argument to my saying that the spanish were better in the fact that mestizos exist was that the intermixing was mostly rape dont be disingenuous at least have the courage to stick to your position or concede it dont try to hide it cortez did the same in mexico but that doesnt mean most mestizaje came from that in fact if we read the primary documents and the literature on the subject we get that the vast majority of mestizaje wasnt because of rape the hispaniola case is irrelevant since it is not indicative of general pattern
3031	1	yeah but you also come from an incredibly homogenous country the united states has had large waves of immigration by so many different people groups that usually end up in isolated communities separated by the usual looking down on because theyre immigrants think bolivians in argentina but way more groups people want to identify and if the place where they are staying wont let themthen it gets displaced man  edit the problem is that immigrants are nothing they are no longer truly from their home and they are never fully accepted to be from where they live
3032	1	they do down in chiapas in some parts
3033	1	this is not inconsistent with anything i said it made the argument that differences have shifted not that theyve disappeared but it also said that the main determinants of those shifts are economic ergogti am not commenting on the closing of educational and economic gaps that is more complicatedbut holding all things constant in terms of economic status you know these gaps decrease it is exactly why there is economic friction between all economic strata of black people and why there is cultural resentment and a sense of betrayal between the poorest and the richest black people
3034	1	youre misunderstanding his friend is not retarded
3035	1	true everyone has saving accounts in dollars
3036	1	i am mexican and even for me is difficult to understand spanish from spain
3037	1	no it is not true creole is almost a different language many french speaking people cannot understand when a haitians speak creole on the other side chilean spanish is just spanish with a weird accent and some indigenous or slang words mixed the problem with chileans is that theywe tend to speak with more slang when speaking
3038	1	im talking more in terms of language like i said i dont doubt canadians and brits love australians but they do joke a lot on how they are very ye you fuckface let is go with the other cunt for some drinks
3039	1	finland and sweden were much poorer then western europe and parts of latin america for a long time their economic growth was post 50s plus they didnt have the disadvantage of engrained inefficient institutions since they are not ex colonies
3040	1	yess thats exactly what i feel  theyll be nice and start small talk but they dont intent be friends
3041	1	what happens is that wealth disparity is real ampx200bi make 30k pesos a month a lot of mexicans dont and i still feel i have a bad salary
3042	1	yeah but that is different to what happened with bolivia colombia gave you part of the amazon voluntarily chile got it in a warfare
3043	1	you should definitely come i think youll definitely have a good time plus since youre picking up a bit of spanish that will make you a big hit
3044	1	i see people spitting on the ground every day not even a trash can
3045	1	well we dont refer to ourselves as american because we have a nationality i dont know anyone who identifies themselves by the continent from which they are fromif america were a country then latin america would be the latin portion of that country not very logical the continent is named after amerigo vespucci and the first cartographer german to name the continent america was actually referring to what today is considered south america so yes its a product of us isolationism and geocentrism

3051	1	why do cs gotta be pronounced like th
3052	1	in the sitcom my wife and kids they had a colombian play as a brazilian in one episode lol
3053	1	ive seen you make this point a few times as a rebuttal which is fine but i just want to make sure you understand what is being said fastest growing doesnt really mean anything if it is not compared to countries of equal economic standinglet is say bolivia has an economy of 1 and chile has an economy of 8 let is say they both increase their economy by 1 bolivia is economy is now 2 and chile is economy is now 9 that means bolivia grew by 100 whereas chile only grew by 12 growth rate wise bolivia looks super impressive yet bolivia and chile is growth was exactly the same
3054	1	well there are definitely parts of brasil that are conservative but prostitution is much less looked down upon in brasil starting with the fact that it is legal drug consumption is similar in that sense so what i would imply is that the large scale consumption is also mirrored in the brazilian case to a lesser scale but the aversion to the two topics is also less still brasil is amongst the more conservative countries of south america more then the andean north or the southern cone so it does make some sense
3055	1	some of them are muslims specially the newer immigrants in patronato you can see some women wearing the hijab while working

3105	1	argentina venezuela cuba and chile are that way now because of the interventions in all cases venezuela wouldnt have given such power to chavez if the us had not supported and financed the 2002 coup detat which failed against chavezargentina wouldnt have followed a similar path without the militaristic coup which the us supported peronism would probably be seen in a different light if it hadnt been removedcuba is that way because the us waged war to control cuba imposed a sadistic dictator which kept openly racist policies and converted the island into a paradise for foreigners while oppressing the opposition and the poor in the island cuba would have probably havent gone that far in their communist approach if the us had been more welcoming towards fidel when he requested help from the us and showed admiration towards some previous us leaders chile with the access it has to some of the most demanded minerals in the world plus the access to the sea would have probably reached a similar level of development without the fascist dictatorship which disappeared tens of thousands which governments did better the us intervened in all of them there is no counterfactual

3119	1	youre quiet honestly comparable to those latinos from the us you know the ones the ones that post on rasklatinamerica asking about whether they are considered latin american and then when people respond that they arent generally considered latin american they say that they never cared because latin america is a backwards continent and that the us considers latin america irrelevant thats essentially you with europe you mention it a lot particularly to americans you enjoy pretending your closer to europe than americans are eh its embarrassing yes i spent five minutes reading your history five in the morning on the bus home from town i had plenty of time and if what youd said was true it would have mattered anyway it bothers you because it wasnt true was it i was curious whether europe was actually irrelevant and obviously it isnt you mention it a lot a lot  which is the point i was making its ridiculous to have a joke that mocks the stupidity of the spanish and then turn around and say how spanish you are surely you understand that

3169	1	ive to admit you got me there words like alberca platicar and so on are used nationwide however words like torta are exclusive to the centre here in the north we call them lonches from the english word lunchhowever the enormous majority of words used in mexican media as well in the song chilanga banda which only uses slang common in mexico city come from the caló which is an official dialectthe caló is a deformed variation of the spanish that includes a lot of nahuatlisms anglicisms and galicisms it also uses a lot of rhetorical figures and albur double meaning and there are also two calós the formal caló popularly known as acento fresa and the vulgar or popular one your típico acento chilango that clearly reflects the socioeconomical division in the megalopolisthe only case in latam where people from the national capital developed a complete different dialect besides mexico city are bonaerenses with their lunfardo
3170	1	amlo
3171	1	you dont have to eat them to like them as living beings
3172	1	gtcaribbean influencedmaybe because were also caribbeans
3173	1	but thats the small village  grouping of shacks
3174	1	yes im sure you dont want to be directing at a person the sign of horns unless its obviously a joke what context do you think im omitting
3175	1	by the time people stop talking about us imperialism latin americans and their governments will have been dooped hoodwinked and bamboozled by 2 to 3 more subsequent nationspeople must really get with the times if they hope to seize the future
3176	1	the mexican empire will rise again
3177	1	maybe méxico we watch their soup operas and chavo del 8
3178	1	thats a good point thanks for sharing
3179	1	its a hard world headeating capitalism all around
3180	1	mmm maybe its just that so few people live in uruguay that there really isnt a huge variety of accentsi can tell when someones from the border with brazil or the interior but thats about it
3181	1	the poor are poor because they dont work hard enough lulz
3182	1	awesome around what year was this
3183	1	interesting i understand to clarify uruguayans maintain no perception of europe or europeans at all except obviously as an integral cultural influence almost as influential as the culture of the indigenous peoples
3184	1	i was watching clips from the new hitman game ive just realized i dont think ive ever seen colombia represented as anything other than small towns in the middle of a tropical jungle cartels are optional
3185	1	this graph exposes the fallacy in your charthttpsmimgurcom2wpnj89it shows the disastrous consecuences of the allende is economic policies and shows the economic boom 19751980 thanks to the economic liberalism propossed by the chicago boys you cant give credit to allende for those 5 years
3186	1	some of my argentinian and brazilian friends have gotten mad at me for saying im american i mean nothing by it but everyone in the world knows what people mean when they say american
3187	1	actually i never paid attention to this good question i personally dont consciously choose one side but i think the majority of the people i know my relatives and i usually kiss the right side twice  but i dont think there is any particular reason for this i guess people just got used to this and now do it on autopilot
3188	1	louco no colonialismo
3189	1	live in mass now mother is from central america ive planning on moving to l america to teach english because i hate how conservative this country is among other reasons
3190	1	what how ask anyone else in this subreddit how they see racism in the us in comparison to our region the us is so much more racist it literally institutionalized it they also took longer to legalize gay marriage then many of us i think you are taking the whole picture of mexico and our countries and comparing it to the major city you went to on the east or west coast homophobia in the us is far worse in general go to the towns or to the interior notice how i dont even need to strawman with the deep south since i know you could pull up central america as our counter example even though the deep south has more people in a country that has less people then our region drugs being more frowned upon here the us has more people imprisoned due to drugs then the entirety of latin americawith half the population try talking to someone about drugs away from the liberal cities that is the big difference really drugs are decriminalized or at least the basic ones in various latino countries the us has a far larger rural population as a percentage then most major countries in latin america look at argentina 8590 urban colombia 70 so you think oh new york is quite liberal so the us is liberal no new york has with it is metro area 75 of the population buenos aires has almost 50 bogotá has 25 of colombia el df almost 25 if you sum up the major urban areas in the major countries of latin america they are as liberal as the major us cities even more at times plus they are more representative of the latin american population the us is waaaay more religious outside the major liberal cities 76 of the us population identifies as religious which is the same as latin america in fact again our major countries are less religious then there is the nature of religion protestantism and evangelism surged because the catholic church was perceived as corrupted and immoral as in too liberal those subsets of christianity literally surged as fundamentalist catholism is waaaay more liberal in every way but economically so much so that weber wrote a book on how catholism was corrupting and not as moral as he economically and laboriously correct protestantism the us drinks more because the top ten percent of drinkers in the us drink half the consumption of the country in typical us fashion there is enormous abuse of the drug like all other drugs since the us is the largest consumer per capita of the 5 most consumed drugs except for cocaine in which it is second this doesnt make them accepted since cocaine isnt exactly accepted anywhere neither are any of the hard drugs so there is a clandestine binge consumption which is usually indicative of repression muslims are more accepted in the us that is true dude as you say have you been to the hotter parts of our countries they dress the same in fact clothing comparison doesnt make sense in that category since you can go to a crappy neighborhood in any latino country and people especially women dont wear almost any clothes that is not a problematic thing or what i was referring to let is exclude that from argument since it is far more anecdotal and we could fight all day about it without any concrete arguments what are you talking about not thinking latin america is more conservative because of not seeing it on tv i bloody live in bogotá ive lived in latin america the majority of my life with an exception of ten years in the us and a couple between france and italy ive traveled my country extensively and brasil quite a bit too ive been to every country in latin america although of course they ones i know best are my country colombia brasil and between argentina and chile third western europe is more liberal then us the us not even close cant even sit next to someone on the bus in the us without it being a big deal
3191	1	the main problem for me is we are obligated to pay the government social security it could be obligatory for the company to pay it and up to the worker to choose which one he wants the governmental plan sucks
3192	1	all is not but taking into account the northern coast is about 3537 of the territory i woud say you cant affirm the contrary either
3193	1	frat boys always wear polo though
3194	1	gt hydrocarbons were nationalized not because that is inherently badwhy is it inherently bad brasil canada argentina and mexico have nationalized oil and gas industriesgt this is the right way to nationalize a natural resourcewhy is this the right waygt bolivia looks to be heading to a dictatorshipwhy you didnt address that are the elections going to be rigged
3195	1	mmm yeah most people dont even have an ideea of a realistic meaning of the word probably
3196	1	thats an oddly specific word
3197	1	i think the street layout and the height of the buildings make it visually more similar to a smaller new york or other american city or moscow maybe
3198	1	im not sure where you get that actual issues just get dismissed in canada americans go around believing its your right to criticize and impose your values on others because americans handle very well their actual issues and agreed canadians really have been extremely horrible with indigenous rights however i dont think there are many colonized countries in the americas that have treated their indigenous people exceptionally wellbut back to the actual question of this post i dont think canadians are as obsessed with race in comparison to americans based on what ive heard
3199	1	i read this and now im craving buñuelos
3200	1	gt the us state department has stated that us assistance programs provided training institution building and other support to individuals and organizations understood to be actively involved in the brief ouster of the chavez government the cia has released documents showing that the bush administration had advance knowledge of the coup but the white house and state department lied about the events claiming it was not a coup at all in an effort to help it succeedthe bush administration claims that it is not currently funding efforts to topple venezuelas government but it is pouring millions of dollars into organizations within the country and wont divulge where this money is goinghttpswwwhuffingtonpostcommarkweisbrotandrobertnaimancorrectthefactsonusve_b_31612htmlyou are still ignoring the support of the previous coup in the 50s which led to dictatorship which supported the systematic abuse of human rights plus the following us support of ithttpswwwhuffingtonpostcommarkweisbrotandrobertnaimancorrectthefactsonusve_b_31612htmlgt a third member of the latin american triangle in us policymaking is john negroponte now ambassador to the united nations he was reagan is ambassador to honduras from 1981 to 1985 when a ustrained death squad battalion 316 tortured and murdered scores of activists a diplomatic source said negroponte had been informed that there might be some movement in venezuela on chavez at the beginning of the yearthe most reactionary sectors in the united states were also implicated in the conspiracy he saidhttpswwwtheguardiancomworld2002apr21usavenezuelagt besides recognitioneven if it was only that instant recognition of a coup which lasted less than a week pretty much means that the us supported another toppling of a democratically elected government in favour of certain elites
3201	1	ok of you say so im from argentina my income was 1700 dollars per month in 2016 now it is 300 and going down i prefer chile all the way

3203	1	what a weird bot
3204	1	seriously check out the link though if youre curious i think its my favourite divinyls song lt3
3205	1	no i disagree im not particularly familiar with uruguay and the relationship between uruguay and europe however that uruguayans are entirely apathetic to europe is ridiculous the notion itself is absolutely undermined by previous comments of yoursgt but ny is barely italian to begin with hahaha go to buenos aires montevideo or sao paulo for italian culture outside of italythere are italians that would disagree although why would you even caregt many americans here are asking questions related to how foreigners view their country instead of learning about european countries and their cultures expand your horizons just an observationwhy would you care it was a discussion between americans and europeans regardless europeans  often ask similar questions on raskanamericangt well not related to chocolate but in uruguay every 29th of every month we eat gnocchi and put money under the plate for good luck lol i guess thats due to italian immigrationtotally disinterested i seegt sure but that does not apply to every countryif you look at uruguay 90 of people are of european descent not mixed but entirely european similar to argentina chile as well as parts of brazil and cubacome on mate any pretense of indifference is well and truly obliterated at this stagethis comment was admittedly quite odd toogt first off negro is referring to the poor uneducated person not the person with black skinsecond by  uruguay is whiterwhy is the fact that uruguay is whiter relevant it isntafter all that the joke is that the spanish europeans are idiots except that uruguayans are apparently the most spanish european latin american country the whitest the most european and therefore idiots as well im sorry mate i dont get the joke its counter intuitive
3206	1	america doesnt refer to the continent in english in english speaking countries schools use a model that has north america and south america as two continents thats why youll often hear english speaker regardless of where theyre from refer to the americas as a plural
3207	1	im not sure what you are trying to say
3208	1	well sure but geography has been a determinant in that i mean the colombian north coast is more similar to pr dr cuba and venezuela then to the rest of the country the gaucho populated part of the argentine pampa is more similar to southern brasil the llanos of colombia and venezuela and such then to jujuy and rosario minas gérais and parts of central brasil are more similar to andean colombia then to the northeast so it is kind of hard to have every country equated when we arent even homogenous from within
3209	1	oh do you want to swap here in germany you are basicaly forced to read the sorrows of young werther in school a book about a guy in puperty moaning through a whole book that he cant get that one girl and than he dies
3210	1	i agree with you i dont think we should be trying to actively cooperate anymore but what im saying is that cutting all ties will only backfire to us and they will bother us more
3211	1	you have to be viralatista level ignorant like most people in the region people are capable of understanding avances mathematics and software but cant understand price differences and economic realities so you get people most people basically that think over there you earn 24 times as much which is true but that prices are like 10 more then here which is false most people who can migrate will live a life that is basically the same as here slightly better or slightly worse but when most of what you know of life in canada the us or europe is what youve seen in television or movies or that one time you went on vacation it is not surprising they go to the best neighborhoods because they are on vacation they are there to spend money and see the best things and think everyone lives like that all the time canada is nice life on average at least economically is better then colombia my country but colombians go and think wow look a salary of 100 thousand a year if i made that in colombia i wouldnt have to worry about anything again but again price differences still though visiting is nice plus canadians are kind in general
3212	1	the fact the us doubled their oil production within 23 years is not a natural order of things especially considering us allies such as the saudi arabia skyrocketed their production in the same periodso the china is debt trap of venezuela is most definitely a thing to be blamed on their politicians for signing such a loan but wouldnt have happened if the usa didnt lower the oil prices for its geopolitical gains
3213	1	cuba literacy rate before castro 60cuba literacy rate with castro 96us life expectancy rate 79 years oldcuba life expectancy rate 80 years oldeducation is free healthcare is free
3214	1	the history of europe is interconnected with the history of the americas and the other continents you cannot say that the americas would not have developed since there is no way to know by certainty

3224	1	i think youre reaching youll need to provide lexical evidence of american in various languages over time proving a distinct change around the 1900s when the united states started projecting regional power and asserting hegemonyto me it is a matter of linguistic development over time and not some socialcommentary on the us is hegemony the country received it is sovereignty first it named itself something rather generic a bunch of states that united on the continent of america and the demonym just took hold from there as other countries also took their sovereignty and named themselves things they took on demonym that werent americanedit this also sounds like the time for me to turn the tables and say what latin americans always say on this subreddit it is a word calm down everyone knows that context matters and in this context it just refers to us nationality first world problems god this is what happens when you dont have actual problems to solve s
3225	1	gtit definitely does not work that waywell it does we use offensive slurs and pass them as banter whether you like it or not thats a factgtinstead of improving your race you should improve your social circleno need to make it personal go ahead and change the whole of venezuelan society your ignorance nor your denying doesnt matter people say it face realitygtit is widely known that white people cannot be victims of racismyou do know that racism can be done by any color against any color your views are skewed racism against whites happen what is happening in sa is no other thing than plain racism first it was whites against others now whites are the target reverseracism is just pc racism no need for sarcasm ive explained the situation in sa to people and they understood it perfectly the problem is media coverage and the use of racism as a political toolgtlet is take a look at this quote from the archived wikipedia linkyou can deny it but the whole thread spawned because of one study saying so go check op for that its not the firstgtthe only real exceptions were oilrich venezuela where income inequality sometimes breaks along racial linesyou can cherry pick all you want you can try to resume the outcome of the study to a single line and it even uses sometimes ffs that fits your narrative rural migration to the cities is one of the reasons why the peripheries are darker than the center but that topic enters the realm of venezuelas history and i dont really want to dive that deep slavery and the casta system left a scar your mi negro theory comes from that and racial correlation between poorcrime also steems from it as i said we as a society hold whiteness over brown or black your feelingsbeliefssocial circle doesnt matter and as proof of that you can look at the backslash from the recent coronation of the petare beauty queen
3226	1	no it is venezuela that left under chavez
3227	1	off the top of my head here are some chileans of croat descentbaldo prokurica alejandro jadresic edmundo pérezzujovic igor garafulic pedro vuskovic radomiro tomic gabriel boric carolina goic borojevic all of them held political positions several of them were state ministers if im not mistaken the former argentinean president nestor kirchner is the son of a chileancroat mother but i may be wrong there are quite a few sportspeople of croat descent as well luka tudor nicolás peric milovan mirosevic marko biskupovic ivo basay hatibovic another croat who left his mark in the country was the great man himself mirko jozic who lead colo colo to win the 1991 copa libertadores the countrys only so far oh and probably the richest man in chile andrónico luksic is also of croat descent there must be more prominent ones but those are the ones i can remember now
3228	1	youre now moderator of rvenezuela
3229	1	i agree as an american ive always been a little annoyed how total strangers act too familiar with each other ive always wondered ifhow the quality of this is different in latin american countries though
3230	1	there are also informal regions north south etc defined by cultural and historical reasons but is mostly used in geographythe government has tried to give some degree of  well integration within them by making a mostly failed attemp to run regional parliaments and concils the governors would meet and try to orgazine laws and etc but since each state has its own interest it was mostly about making politicswhat happened is that some development companies were born like regional banks and state companies so well these regions are quite irrelevant to politics when compared to states but have their own state companies and also join forces to pass legislation try to receive funds from the union engage tax war with other states and regionssome times you see news like governors and congressmen from region x unite to pass law y or  try to receive funding for something obviously lay y would benefit states from said region everyone is trying to take its share of the federal budget
3231	1	again the us would replace chavez with a far right dictator who would run on corporatism and make the country just as bad as it is today i have no qualms with your assertion that both chavez and maduro are horrible people i just dont think the us would help when it comes to getting rid of dictators putting your hands up and waiting for an imperialistic power is historically a horrible idea i dont know how many examples of something like this happening and going wrong for the subject countrys populace it takesthe us does not care about the venezuelan people most americans cannot point out venezuela on a map careful what you wish for
3232	1	gtthe same goes for the us backed dictatorship in brazil the military started an hiperinflation that lasted about 20 yearsi dont think the tabloids the spaniard has been reading go that far back in time
3233	1	im mostly familiar with the northern regions of colombia so thats my opinion based on the little i know about the central american or caribbean cultures  in your experience colombia seems more culturally similar to honduras or el salvador
3234	1	bolivia poverty rate2005 before socialist president 64 bolivia poverty rate 2017 with socialist president 38  httpsesmwikipediaorgwikianexopac3adses_por_porcentaje_de_pobreza_en_latinoamc3a9rica
3235	1	because it is an artificial buzzword created by napoleon and most people mean iberianamerica when they said latinamerica which is wrong haitians probably identify more with the caribbean
3236	1	yes because no one consumed drugs in latin america what government cooperation with the cartels there are corrupt officials who have been bought but most in the national government are absolutely not bought and much less cooperative the traditional oligarchy hates cartels as a threat to their traditional economic and political hegemony so of course the government which is in general in the pocket of the oligarchy would be against the cartels
3237	1	nothat is a statistic from fox news and the statistic says if i remember correctly that 70 of the production of the country comes from the private sector because spoiler alert public sector is inefficient as fuck
3238	1	even 31 minutos
3239	1	i did not get the reference do you mean that mexicans cannot easily move and work in another country in the americas compared to all other nations in america
3240	1	i might suggest that latino in an us context might be different that in chile  i think part of this issue is that it has a us census definitionhttpswwwcensusgovprodcen2010briefsc2010br02pdf which is different that latino in portuguese for me and i assume spanish  ive often wondered if my brazilian family would be considered latino in the us or not  certainly they wouldnt consider haitian by this definition but what about guyana or french guyana or suriname
3241	1	yes some argentinan people on the internet are horrible specially if they are english speakers it is people with superiority complex for the rest idk man i lived here all my life and im telling it how i feel it is shitty people are everywhere we are latin americans this country was built from people from all places our borders are open anyone can come in live here and it doesnt have to explain a thing to anyone
3242	1	wow i guess this kind of questions can only be answered by personal opinion i believe that our biggest success was legalization of abortion in three cases and i agree with you with about the murder of camilo catrillanca
3243	1	i actually thought that episode was funny to be honest and im more inclined to forgive the simpsons because theyre constantly making fun of the us
3244	1	my bad i thought amoedo was the candidate for novo in the last election
3245	1	ive tried no subtitles
3246	1	dude just pay attention to the trends on your hollywood movies and the ones that already got really famous most of the time are them that consummate the stereotypes moviesseries and now internet the last one not so sure haha
3247	1	yeah but i think the heterogeneity is part of what makes latin american for example in the us the fact that the west coast being so far from the east coast but being similar in liberalconservative terms or northwest to other regions the logic being if it is one country and one people then there will be long distance similarities and not just similarities because you are close or else those close subregions that are similar would be more like sub countries and therefore could stand on their own which could imply they should be their own country in terms of conservatism youre like chileans but there are many other things that make you more like colombia which is why im pro latino identity in a loose fashion at the minimum like ten times people have posted here what country do you feel closest too in the region and ive seen mexicans say colombiaive seen brazilians say colombia ive heard chileans say colombia but ive also seen brazilians say argentina mexicans argentina chileans argentina so the point is it depends on what you give emphasis to and so we all share something with the other major countries in the region and therefore there is at least a basic pan latino linkage for example in colombia when tango exploded in argentina it hit hard here especially medellín when salsa hit it became very popular especially in cali ranchera the same and in the coast and the llanos reggaeton also were the second largest producer and medellín is the fortress you can find similarities like that with every country and the others with strange combinations like bolivia in food is more similar in some ways to argentina then to peru
3248	1	a country in the balkans its like a peninsula next to italy where croatia and serbia and other countries are
3249	1	no but spain france and britain never colonized brazil it was the portugese sure spain had mexico but mexico was not spanish soil it was a colony meaning that the king of spain did not live in mexico unlike the queen of porgugal did live in brazil plus mexico city was never the capital of spain plus the majority of mexicans at the time were mostly meztisto meaning they were not allowed to travel back to spain unlike the large pennisulare population of brazil who could travel back and forth from brazil to portugal
3250	1	oh we have food and clothes higher salaries and less corruption would be nice also tourism bring development you will need to develop infrastructure built things actually and in serbia most developed region and most visited is belgrade the capital
3251	1	this is so true
3252	1	gt didnt wanted
3253	1	i thought the same thing but im colombian american so i didnt know that it had a meaning in colombia since its not like your everyday type of thing i looked it up on google and in italy spain france greece portugal brazil cuba argentina uruguay mexico peru chile colombia venezuela and ecuador this is an offensive gesture
3254	1	i think op said the misconception was about him fleeing cartels nothing about calling him a criminal unless i read it wrong if they did then yeah that goes too far and anyone would be rightly upset imo i think people in america tend to just assume what they hear about mexico or central america whether right or wrong applies to the rest of latin america which is obviously ignorant just gotta try and educate people in that case a lot of the times it isnt intentionally malicious
3255	1	nah im from the us i just lurk here to help improve my spanish and portuguese i gotta say though also not a fan of portuguese as it is in portugal compared to brazilian portuguese
3256	1	fucking accents from spain sound stupid man thats why
3257	1	i think it because we forget quickly
3258	1	brazil is a lot more conservative than the us though
3259	1	pr is spanish speaking catholic and economic collosping guyana is english protestant and full of untapped oil
3260	1	a noble savage is a literary stock character who embodies the concept of the indigene outsider wild human an other who has not been corrupted by civilization and therefore symbolizes humanity is innate goodness
3261	1	no although i plan on it eventually although another european commenter that has been to buenos aires literally said it didnt remind him of european cities at all the majority of photos appear to be of puerto madero but even the ones that arent to me look like san francisco or somethinghttpsmediabizjusviewimg10755112sanfranciscohousing1750xx373020980251jpghttpsencryptedtbn0gstaticcomimagesqtbn3aand9gcsclgsbl73ioxwqpczqizlyspia3iv9_rjcxvv44qt1guxw6eorhttpswwwgooverseascomsitesdefaultfilesstyles1014xpublicimages20180417buenos20aires20pixabay_0jpgitokwzxdrnmqi mean i understand what youre saying parts of the city do look european but its not parts of the city were talking about its the whole city  parts of new york look european too in fact they look like buenos aireshttpswwwsolsalutecomwpcontentuploads201808plazademayo29683x1024jpghttpsc8alamycomcompakk107newyorkcityfederalcourthouselowermanhattannycakk107jpghttpsargentinatravelblogsayhuequecomwpcontentuploads201308avenidademayojpghttpsipinimgcom236x9e40df9e40df8844b91226106c896cb48fe0aemanhattannewyorkapartmentsjpghttpsi0wpcomwwwsolsalutecomwpcontentuploads201808avenidademayo76jpgssl1httpsseraphinacorazzafileswordpresscom201212nycgreenwichvillagerooftops001finaljpgw800i think aerial view actually provided quite a good example  buenos aires looks nothing like torinohttpsthumbsdreamstimecomzbuenosairessmokeaerialphotopanoramaargentinacitymostpollutedworldnexttohongkong34161574jpgit looks like san franciscohttpscompscanstockphotocomaerialviewofsanfranciscostockimages_csp48527550jpgnot torinohttpl7alamycomzoomsb2f5031eec244fd7885ff939d972283dturintorinopiedmontitalyaerialviewitalyrooftorinoturintownbmmj7mjpgmaybe ill change my mind when i see it in person even though the other guy didnt but at the moment it doesnt really as european as it does american to me nothing wrong with that i like american cities at time maybe close to parts of madrid but overall thishttpspreviews123rfcomimagesdanflcreativodanflcreativo1703danflcreativo17030014674535669windowplaneshotaerialviewofbuenosairesargentinajpgdoesnt strike me as european not anymore than certain canadian american cities
3262	1	that is fair the rhythms just feel very unique and brazil almost seems to be it is own self contained musical world as opposed to central and south american music which have a lot more commonalities
3263	1	dude an accent is just intonation this is literally words that nobody says i mean we are familiar with some words due the mexican dubs but they are still never used outside of mexico i have never see a nonmexican saying platicar nor alberca nobody talks about cutters to call an exacto knife and a camellón y a huge camel for us not a piece of concrete between an avenue we were confused with the tortas de jamon from el chavo since nobody calls a sandwich a torta besides mexico
3264	1	oh equatorial guinea the long forgotten cousinchildren i wish we were closer doesnt sound that weird to me though it is just like an african person speaking peninsular spanish i can see how to latin americans it can sound pretty weird though
3265	1	i think pinche and puñetero are the pejorative words
3266	1	those belgians surely brought a lot of progress to congo s
3267	1	well they are culturally similar to rest of balkans but geographicly they are not balkans maybe small southern part of the country
3268	1	we do the same thing in argentina
3269	1	yeah thats what i think as well for eastwrn europeans americans must be friendly i hear eastern europeans are one of the coldest people
3270	1	im actually looking to teach english in colombia i had a two week vacation in barcelona and found i got along with colombians really well ive also heard the english teaching market there is growing there doing my applications now since ive been told the best time to get hired is february biasedwise im more inclined to hold my country accountable for its sins and weirdness i always say america has really only given 3 great gifts to the world  jazz peanut butter and hiphop and national parks which are beautiful

3275	1	yeah no doubt you have your own growing industries but what i was refering to was if the feelings towards more foreign presenceproducts would be well received a couple of days ago i found out a can of corn that we used for lunch was actually from china like dont we have corn in this country we have if you start seeing more clothes food and investment made from foreign companies from the eu and outside would that be moreso welcomed

3288	1	literally two lines in a wikipedia article linking to another article that makes it is own interpretation of a study done by sweedish economists the objective of the original study was to measure the impact of economic freedom on tolerance here is the summary of the original studytolerance has the potential to affect both economic growth and wellbeing it is therefore important to discern its determinants we contribute to the literature by investigating whether the degree to which economic institutions and policies are marketoriented is related to different measures of tolerance crosssectional and firstdifference regression analysis of up to 69 countries reveals that economic freedom is positively related to tolerance towards homosexuals especially in the longer run while tolerance towards people of a different race and a willingness to teach kids tolerance are not strongly affected by how free markets are stable monetary policy and outcomes is the area of economic freedom most consistently associated with greater tolerance but the quality of the legal system seems to matter as well through instrumental variables and firstdifference results we find indications of a causal relationshipampx200bthe author of the article linked in wikipedia makes quite a leap from the original study taking the number of people who picked people from another race when asked to pick from groups of people they would not want as neighbors and makes this statementif we treat this data as indicative of racial tolerance then we might conclude that people in the bluer countries are the least likely to express racist attitudes while the people in red countries are the most likelythis is a very simplistic view of the original research paper and without establishing a baseline is pretty much useless as an indicator of racism you can say for example that people in venezuela are less tolerant to other races than people in argentina but what does this mean exactly are they white people who didnt want black neighbors  black people who didnt want white neighbors  what is the racial demographic of the people interviewed for the original research paper these are all very important questions that are completely ignored by the author of the article who seems to be merely interested in clicks and not in achieving any kind of accurate resultit might just be me but i would take any article that has more updates and corrections than original text with a grain of salt
3289	1	how integrated is chile can chileans live and work indefinitely among the core mercosul countries also doesnt this result in large influx of migrants overwhelming an economy for example what prevents someone from paraguay argentina from moving to say brazil in large numbers

3295	1	ive never been to santiago id love to btw ive been told santiago is more europelike  downtown bogotá has some cool colonial spainstyle streets the rest of the city is pretty but not picturesque like for tourists if you wanted to feel like in the third world you would have to go to dangerous places for tourists where you can get mugged or murdered so dont do itthe weather is falllike with a lot of rain even when it is hot

3299	1	pleno empleo less than 5 unemployment i dont know how you say that in englishargentina doesnt have a stable economy since 1955 only between 19902008 had low inflation and fiscal deficit has more than 100 years the crisis of argentina is not deep like venezuela but is decadency a long onehad a living standard like france in 1930 to had less gdp per capita than chile means decadencethis is the explanation httpsyoutubeseexkqao9c
3300	1	correct federal discretionary spending where education agriculture environment and science fall under the us spends more on military then all of those categories combined and others which i have not mentionedwhen you take into account mandatory and discretionary spending its 16 of the total budget think about that for every 5 dollars the government spends 1 dollar goes towards the militarythe us spends more on military than the next 8 countries combined
3301	1	whats exactly the mission here
3302	1	gtamong other things its a product of not having a dictatorshipnah it is mainly a product of brainwashing funded by the soft dictatorship of us govt and the militaryindustrial complex no need to sugar coat it
3303	1	decís que estamos pasando una tormenta pero haciendo lo que hay que hacer ese recursodiscurso ya lo quemaron déjenlo morir
3304	1	i found paris and barcelona to be similarly quilomberas as you say havent been to italy so cant speak on that genoa might be a good shout too
3305	1	that is literally what the other guy said only with china and the usa replacedand of course i dont think that china russia iran or even the usa are shining examples of human rights they all suck and theyre all imperialistic with the exception of maybe iran and they all use third world countries as proxies in their disputesbut unfortunately there is something called geopolitics and because of it no country who is a global power can allow the development of a regional power that close so it brings me back to my original point it would be better for latin america if the axis mundis moved literally anywhere other than the usa
3306	1	gt son gringospreachmexicanamerican italianamerican polishamerican irishamerican are all terms boring americans use to try to stand appart from the rest they use their heritage like we use football teams theyre all yankis from down here

3309	1	why do you say portugal and spain are such lame countries
3310	1	there is no evidence to support the electoral fraud narrative brazilian elections run a lot more smoothly than american ones tbh
3311	1	it is not that it is unthinkable it is that there is evidence supporting gender symmetry in intimate partner violence although the issue is very nuanced and it depends a lot in what kind of violence were talking aboutin any case if you want to use homosexuals as some sort of control group youll find that intimate partner violence is more prevalent in lesbians than in heterosexual couples how does that work with explaining ipv through the patriarchy lenses
3312	1	no we arent
3313	1	gtargentina is also allied to the rest of the western world even if they lose their first battles us is probably going to sell them some f16s on a discount right awaywe cant pay for them and the usa wouldnt sell amraams so even if they somehow get in range with venezuelan fighters the venezuelan flankers would eat them for breakfast
3314	1	it is possible but not easy the passenger boat from iquitos to santa rosa in the border leaves once a day and takes 10 hours then you need to cross to brazil tabatinga am and take another boat to manaus this line leaves twice a day and takes 3 to 4 days to get to the destination from manaus to belém near the atlantic ocean the trip takes 5 days but it is much more frequent because there are boats that carry both passengers and express cargo you could also get on a cruise ship and keep going along the brazilian coastgoing from iquitos to the mouth of the river is easier than the other way if you wanna try boats take almost twice the time to go up the riverin manaus there is a lot of tourist infrastructure especially to receive cruise ships only certain destinations within the amazon have structure to receive tourists well almost everywhere else it is just a poor region with almost no infrastructure whatsoever let alone for tourists
3315	1	sorry for not hitting all of your points and i think you are right to a certain point but idk for colombia where youre from but all in all i agree with the poster above mexico is far more conservative on a host of issues than the states and this is from someone who has lived in several cities within mexicothe us and europe with the exception of mexico city mexico is highly highly conservative   you cite a lot of facts regarding rurality in comparison to mexico and the states some of the greatest concentrations of conservatism and religion is in the biggest cities monterrey queretaro guadalajara are strongly conservative in attitudes to drugs sex religion etc the things you hear in monterrey wouldnt be heard in montana unless drunk racism in the us can be bad but you need to spend time in mexico especially in the north if you think it is even half
3316	1	gt make more money relative to prices have less work hours and more vacations those are some big reasons why i left mexico to live in the netherlands funny how it can work the other way around in colombia
3317	1	i need to prove it thats for sure i dont have that time unfortunatelythe country being called united states of america is enough thoughregardless of language if hes an american so i am the language we are typing in english implies your country itself is a bunch of states located in america what is america a continent you can divide it as you wish and call it the americas but there will always be at least two countries within such subdivision canadians mexicans brazilians all of them americans so op should have specified
3318	1	i understand how integration works in the us im saying that 1 you cant call us incredibly homogenous countries and 2 that countries that receive immigration will necessarily end up with the same integration environment and as an example you have latin american countries which for x or y reason managed to create a different modeli personally dont like this double identity that migrant groups in the us end up creating for themselves i think it ends up reinforcing certain race obsessions and us vs them mentality i like to think of myself with regards to only myself and not my ancestors who ive never met but this is a personal opinion i am not qualified to say its objectively better just that it is obvious to me that a mexicanamerican is not a mexican and only shares superficial traits
3319	1	yeah i know there are a few with little parking space but that still is imo the one thing that sets american urban planning apart it doesnt have to be universal to be representativethat being said the only one from those cities that i can maybe see a semblance of in buenos aires is ny san francisco and boston are different between each other let alone with bs as seattle is not in the slightest bit similar to bs as either
3320	1	i dont like it but it is not like there is any options the other side does the same to the dictatorship we had in 1937both fhc and lula praised getúlio vargas in his most important biography
3321	1	i dont think anyone other than him would support an idiot like bolsonaro
3322	1	is it i remember it but i guess false memories form
3323	1	i dont get the link from college student ro mice in the house
3324	1	depends on how you look at itand no natives are not considered black if they hide their ancestry they pass as white in brazil i think
3325	1	yeah you are right
3326	1	colombia venezuela and equador together are still smaller than brazil or is there another country involved that i dont know about
3327	1	the economy minister is promising to shrink inequality he is in favor of universal basic income evenyou may not believe him but that is what he is promising
3328	1	the cuban government is slowly opening up the economy things should get better
3329	1	the abridged version lmao
3330	1	nah puerto madero is the least representative area of the city it is true that it looks more like the examples you mention but it is a small new and nonrepresentative area especially in comparison to the rest of the city which definitely looks more europeanit is like saying that london looks like an american city because of canary wharfhttpwwwenergysavingtrustorguksitesdefaultfilesstylesfree_croppublicblogimagescanarywharfjpgitok_hybqgq0the 9 de julio is actually more in line with the futurist projects of italian fascism although most of them were not actually completed and neither was the 9 de julioalso the fact that american cities are car centric does absolutely affect their appearance nowhere else in the world to my knowledge do you get city centres that are mostly parking lots and free standing buildings one of the things that defines the cityscape of buenos aires is the medianera party wall dividing wall for better or worseregarding the aerial view i dont see much of a semblance between your aerial shot of bs as which isnt even close to the city centre and the others especially chicago looks completely different as for the grid plans look up the eixample in barcelona or torinoi have to ask though have you ever been here because this is literally the first time i hear or read of anyone ever thinking buenos aires looks us american meanwhile ive heard countless of times that the city looks and feels very european it is not nicknamed paris of the south for nothing look up plaza de mayo avenida de mayo recoleta instead of puerto madero
3331	1	you cant talk about rock in brazil imo without talking about raul seixashttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvet5xtt3bfva the guy who really popularized rock in brazil during the 70 is ive linked a collection my personal favourite is the 10th songbut there was rock in brazil before him during the 60 is we had the jovem guarda new school movement whose most famous figure was roberto carloshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgdoiywxhew who became a romantic singer in later years somewhat like elvis although the best analogy would be michael bolton i guess they were young brazilians living the american dream so to say erasmo carloshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvacp8fn_bwak no relation to roberto and wanderléa httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzuhief7rhtc make up the holy trinity of jovem guarda other names

fevershttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv0movaumbuha among othersweve also had a big movement during the 60 is called tropicália no translation that aimed to mix brazilian traditional music with american pop culture they were the brazilian equivalent of the hippie movement their manifestos were two albums the collective album tropicália ou panis et circensishttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkiiwbhqtb7w and caetano veloso is tropicáliahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhwfbszadfto if you pay attention to the first album ive linked youll see that a lot of different artists sing songs all members of the tropicália movement such as the aforementioned caetano velosohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvckydg29xwuu gilberto gilhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnw0pqe4gxvg tom zéhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvseqavawxm6m and os mutanteshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsepsfoibjho after the movement ended some went towards a more samba oriented career like caetano and gil while some kept on rocking like tom zé who became known as the brazilian johnny cash and half of the mutantes their lead singer rita leehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxpydwtxdgmq had a really successful solo career being considered by many myself included the queen of brazilian rock tropicália also had branches in cinema theatre and painting but that is another discussionassociated with tropicália but imo distinct from it were the samba rock most people would only know jorge ben jorhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchve6wadhwxqpa formerly jorge ben and novos baianoshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv0fvpqzkw9bk but i really like banda black riohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtlafnzyboc0 too some people would include tim maiahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvw5zcxhbh28k as well but to me he is more of an rampb guythe 70 is were somewhat dead in terms of rock n roll in brazil we only had minor underground artists like casa das máquinashttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzb02zia8dm and a chavehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9w7amgkfok0 the first rock band from my city but in the 80 is we had a huge boom in rock bands we had punk rock bands like ratos de porãohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwvujozkhwmg garotos podreshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjddlltzfgno os replicanteshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvypwlvwbqkf4 and inocenteshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrjzt7s_1u we had bands experimenting with what it meant to be a brazilian rock band like titãshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrvjwq_jym paralamas do sucessohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvybrpqqhl_o blitzhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlqi9678jlei camisa de vênushttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvv5iikomu4rs and karnakhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdwbqraj4lpw you had bands

that now metal bands such as sepulturahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvf_6ijeprfes angrahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvytotgk6yq40 sarcófagohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvai1itxx3qv0 and dr sinhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjzuoztctysi were mainstreamrock lost airwave space during the 90 is to genres such as pagode and sertanejo and the 00 is were a really sad time for brazilian rock bands with the successful ones being emo boy bands which i shall not link and imo soandso bands like pittyhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvx7whlo5tmo and charlie brown jrhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkgazwxqk7ac we also had indie bands like cachorro grandehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlz4dkw3ufia and autoramashttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcbbmmmvsxuonowadays rock is pretty much dead in brazil as it is in the rest of the world we have some englishsinging indie bands such as watch out for the houndshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnnj1e2sjlo black drawing chalkshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvaqbveuyeewq audachttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvz4hgeogduyi

that ive only namedropped a few bands tropicalismo and jovem guarda for example are extremely intertwined with brazilian history which could easily take weeks just to give the context
3332	1	my personal favourite is the one with the heart as an ashtray it is just so artistic
3333	1	why would russiachina get involved especially if we allow to sell them the lithium at a lower value than bolivia would
3334	1	gdp per capita not adjusted by ppp

3336	1	ive met a few people with that surname but not super common
3337	1	when why could it be that he actually meant algeria but selected the wrong country in the dropdown box for some reason
3338	1	do you think the us give a shit about taiwanese people starving they support saudi arabia and uae theyve thrown coups and implemented bloody dictators all over the world including in latin america supported dictators like papa amp baby doc and even pol pot a fucking communist for geopolitical reasonsand yeah the us didnt invent taiwan but it is been part of china since the 17th century to claim it is a country of its own just because the leaders of the kuomintang fled there after the communist revolution is ridiculous do you think the usa wouldve recognized it as the true china until 71 if not for geopolitical reasons or anyone reallyand why do you think we hear about taiwan and tibet all the time in the media but never about western sahara in moroccos okinawa in japan or hawaii in the us why wasnt this question about the independence of the anglophone parts of cameroon

3345	1	there is a big list of vocabulary grammar and pronunciation differences between your dialect and mine and the same applies to many other dialects
3346	1	i was making a generalization on purpose just like op in his question
3347	1	as it should be although most college students get cats

3350	1	yes doctors
3351	1	you already said that once before that san telmo reminds you of the french quarter safadinho who is an american living here so he is not lacking in authority and i asked you to expand on it because we didnt see it would you explain from what i always see in movies photos and google streetview i dont see it the houses have a beautiful unique style that i dont see here with ornate iron balconies and exposed brickwork lots of colour even a few palm trees and then those southern wooden houses the architecture is just completely different from the french quarter from what i can see

3364	1	1st im not blind we just have 0 contact with them i bet most brazilians dont even know the difference between bolivia and colombia the only ones people talk about are cuba and venezuela and just because they are communists2nd i may have expressed myself a little badly i dont mean they all have similar phenotypes i meant they look the same culturally to us they are just a bunch of spanish speakers and we generalise mexican culture to engulf all latins i know it is the same things the muricans do but what can i say most brazilians arent exactly well educated and even the ones who are tend to research more about europe than about latin america our media doesnt cover latin american news except for the ones relevant to us latin music doesnt ever reach us unless it becomes big in the us and europe too latin soap operas and tv shows such as chaves get dubbed and many people dont even realise that it isnt a brazilian show i honestly had no idea there was a difference in accent from chileans to argentinians before i joined this sub which has taught me a lot about our neighbours
3365	1	they demand less attention are cleaner you dont have to take them for walks are smaller than dogs they are quiet and you can keep them in a small apartment with no problems considering most students live alone in small apartments with neighbours around them and are generally away for hours it makes more sense

3372	1	so we use the language barrier as an excuse for a poorly defined demonymhow is it unintelligible in english explain it to mebecause as i have already told you if we dig deep enough in your own language a canadian is as american as someone from the usa its hot to us because it doesnt make any sense as a demonym we are very different to each other but we all live in the same continent you can deny cultural similarities you cant deny your country being part of a continent why is it so hard to understand
3373	1	meh ive studied too much journalism theory to believe in  or even support  unbiased news two of the best news outlets in brazil are intercept and antagonista both with clear biasesfolha is still the highest quality journalism made in brazil if youre looking for general news dont mean much i know anyone who says otherwise is fooling themselves
3374	1	yeah the point of view that this country funding training and backing several dictatorships that were responsible for the slaughter of masses of civilians has been a huge success isnt very welcome    i personally doubt that is because the  isub is very leftist
3375	1	thing is that they are not saying the character of santa should be female or gender neutral they are talking about a woman taking the rol of santa in a parade its not the same i personally have no problem with it changing the characters gender however would be pointless in my opinion
3376	1	iran is arab
3377	1	wait are you saying that they should have been preemptively killed in a kill baby hitler kind of way or that they should have faced a trial because of crimes they commited possibly being sentenced to death i am not at all familiar with prechávez venezuelan history
3378	1	gtmen dont usually get killed for reasons associatioed with their condition as a manneither do women otherwise youd have shooters like in the usa but targeting women at the end of any femalecentric event instead of random peoplethat doesnt happen people kill people due intimate partner violence since most men are stronger than most women most of these deaths are men killing their spousegirlfriendloverexetc but they arent killed because they are women as would be the case with the kkk killing blacks or nazis killing jews but due their romantic relationship
3379	1	colonialism is bad doesnt matter who is promoting it
3380	1	you cant easily industrialize with a low population low population density and the lack of easily accessible mineral deposits yeah no steel was produced in argentina until 1945 but could it have been produced a lot earlier than that
3381	1	i like it we should take it chile has taken their access to the sea already anyway why wouldnt we be able to take all this lithium
3382	1	but what about the war between salsacia and conservia
3383	1	same thing with spanish here i had spanish classes in high school but my teacher was both a bad teacher and a bad person i have a conversation spanish but the only things i remember learning in school are todavia  ainda el before words that start with a but remember that arbol is masculine amp the verb gustar is conjugated with the objectand it is a shame we miss so much because of that just to give the stupidest of examples our radios could be playing natalia lafourcade or bomba estereo
3384	1	we love you guysplease come back
3385	1	not quite women can be possesive and believe they own their boyfriendhusband and react violently as well the difference is that due the physical differences women are unlikely to end up killing their so
3386	1	was that supposed to be ironic because until that last sentence i was like yes this guy gets it
3387	1	is voseo in argentina slang vosotros in spain words like palta frutilla and so on are the standard here and used in every single context anything else would be considered foreign or even unknown and opposite is true for other countries also is distinción slang if not is seseo slang thenthere is clearly many different dialects
3388	1	pardo are also white preto is black prieto isnt portuguese
3389	1	pa
3390	1	im saving money to go to bogotá for the exact reasons you listed i love colombian music and i want to experience it first hand i dream of dancing bomba estereo in a club
3391	1	start learning portuguese
3392	1	i dont think he is referring to development ive heard american latinos call people too white for not being able to dance or not liking spicy food or say that they prefer hot weather or that theyre not shy because theyre latinos stuff like that makes chileans feel disconnected from them as we dont relate at all to any of thati dont think that makes us closer to the anglos specifically but those are definitely as strange to us as they are to the average nonhispanic american so i guess that makes us relate to them
3393	1	mc lan and livinho are funk but youre right i shouldve included some brega
3394	1	you think mexico is an incredibly homogenous country while not as much as the us it has had several waves of immigration chinese philipino lebanese african slaves iberian and other euros as well as the multitude of indigenous groups that are not a homogenous at all   brazil peru argentina etc are in the same situation there is something particular about the us wherein people really think they are defined by their ancestors that doesnt occur to the same degree or even in the same manner in other migrant heavy countries
3395	1	stray dogs i swear europeans and americans go crazy some even take them back to their countriesdifference is here stray dog does not equal to a neglected dog most of them are taken care by the neighborhood they live in
3396	1	so youd call the last dictatorship is economic policies socialist
3397	1	shit i wonder if the us would help us trump seems to love bolsonaro
3398	1	why are you so butthurt a hispanic surname and a darker skin color doesnt make you a mexican both of my paternal grandparents have italian surnames and my maternal grandmother has a german onei dont consider myself anything but a uruguayan
3399	1	there are plenty of differences but no enforced segregation
3400	1	gti think your aicraft figures are very inflated wikipedia says 23 su30 and 19 f16s those look to be the only modern fighters global firepower had total aircraft at 280yes now compare that with a literal handful of a4 with 1990s downgraded avionics some pampa light trainers and a dozen or two of pucara coin aircraft which would have been chewed up by the luftwaffe in 1943
3401	1	its sad because their main goal is to protect us
3402	1	eh bands from all over the world make songs about the crimes theyve commited kreator with fascism anthrax with the genocide against natives maiden with colonialsm
3403	1	american as in from the us ive heard comparisons between sao paulo and new york but for buenos aires and montevideo that is a first in what way would you say that they are americanlike because to me the single most distinguishable thing of us american cities are highways lots of parking space suburban sprawl and unwalkability often paired with a lack of public transport except ny and a few others like boston i guess which is not the case for either cities you mention
3404	1	well first and foremost that argentian is economy turned downhill in the mid 1970s not in 1946 or 1930 second that military coups dont equal recessions third that in the last 45 years only one political party handed over to their sucessors a better economy than the one theyve received there are plenty of others of course
3405	1	oh good you know paralamas ive forgotten to put them in the listhere is some more random bands i enjoy inesita barrosohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvx0aevibtmi8 milionário amp josé ricohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlbgjzwylvpu djavanhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlbrdzjuwksw zeca baleirohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbss92kiguho zé ramalhohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxj2rgvep7wq karnakhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvf2ods0za7ac jair rodrigueshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv82drs2z6iqs wilson neveshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmr0zuetrnjk cartolahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvssegssu9tly dominguinhoshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv7sxrccu7o28 alceu valençahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxabq09zwmp0ill also throw some bands from my city curitiba anacrônicahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlnexu_iizrm pelebroi não seihttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvq0lvrv6qb10 relespúblicahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv6uroedpdgm dow raizhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvt_e5wrnzy faicheclereshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkinvwr62xko crocodillahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvc0dqyq6c9is
3406	1	our economy just went to hell in part because of a major draught and the supposed recovery of next year hangs in the balance because we have el niño this season
3407	1	bolivia had access to sea chile took it from them now they are still butthurt
3408	1	there is obvious cause and effect between economic crisis and political crisis but i dont see any correlation let alone causality in the reversethe economy grew during the 1930s despite the lack of democracy even though it didnt reach the 1929 levels most of the world didnt either iirc then between 19491974 we have the greatest period of economic growth in argentine history overall the world was growing even though that was the most politically unstable time since the battle of pavón we had military uprisings coups inflation no true democracy yet gdp per capita grew more than 50we have political stability well mostly 1989 and 2001 were politically unstable due the economic crisis since 1976 and that is when economic decadence takes hold
3409	1	that sounds great how difficult would it be for example to go from iquitos in peru all the way to the atlantic using these boats is there a lot of tourist infrastructure in the amazon towns to go trekking and birdwatching for example
3410	1	simple geopolitics the usa simply cannot afford the luxury of letting a regional power develop in latam because it undermines their influence on their own very yard unless it is a latin american israel a role that could only be played by chile or uruguay but these countries would need stronger armies to do so but brazil andor argentina could never be a developed country at the same time than the uson the other hand the development of latam is good for china for the very same reason the shift of power from the us to china would probably make life better in latam and worse in eastern asia eg in a world controlled by china japan would become brazil
3411	1	if never heard of an argentine eating horse meat maybe mortadella was made with horse meat at first but no longer i think it is all for export we do probably have the best horses for polo and racing it is not a stretch that the same goes for horse meat i guess
3412	1	sadly when a headlining band comes to south america they dont tour with other big european or american bands that said kreator did come a few weeks ago as a supporting band for helloween i couldnt go the show would have ended too late at night and i would have had to wait at 2am alone for the bus from buenos aires to la plata sabatonkreator maidenghost and other tours like that must have been awesomei hope i can catch them next time they comeedit as for songs check out the whole gods of violence album i particularly like satan is real hail to the hordes lion with eagle wings and side by side from that album  hordes of chaos is a classic as well
3413	1	anyone who is seen me here knows i hate the us as much as the next latin but i dont think they had anything to do with this one
3414	1	im just saying i have never in my life heard an actual american say usamerican and the fact that you used an instead of a tells me something
3415	1	actually 854 of brazil is energy is renewable
3416	1	depends on the context
3417	1	sobs in argentinean
3418	1	what about the opposite 70 of crimeans wanted to be russia not ukraine but russia is annexation of crimea has been widely condemned by the west
3419	1	now any attempt of a coup or a revolution will be destroyed not only by venezuela but by russia too
3420	1	that is why the ones that came to brazil needed emergency training to treat simple colds and diarrhea
3421	1	gta first step to being a developed nation would be to follow policies that put us back on track to being a developed nation wow give this man a nobel prizewell let is face it it wouldnt work either as the world is differentgt sure talking about the dictatorship some more will make us rich again no but centering the public discourse in argentine history on wildly inaccurate information will only hurt the development of efficient public policiesin some ways i believe argentina is currently suffering from epoch dysphoria  a political pseudointellectual and communication elite believes returning to the old agrarian export model with an emphasis on laisse fairez politics and sticking to 1960s economic knowledge is the way to go osvaldo bayer once said the current administration is a return to the 1930s but i think if general justo was darth vader these guys are kylo ren even in the 1930s the children of the generation of the 80s knew the agrarian export model was limited worse these kylo rens want to return to it despite the weather being vastly different now than in 1880  and it is only going to get worse
3422	1	what is melon the fruit
3423	1	dude just my little town in brazil had at least 13 different immigrant waves from the ones i can remember italian german polish japanese spanish portuguese lebanese netherlands latvia russian austrian ukranian swedish rio grande do sul alone has pockets where only italian german russian or polish is spoken other states have different immigrant pockets stop your bullshit
3424	1	good point although in this specific case i am thankful for the existence of disposable kleenex as someone who has suffered from many childhood allergies i wouldve needed dozens of handkerchiefs per day sometimes and when people are sick disposing of used handkerchiefs makes sense to reduce the risk of transmitting it to someone else
3425	1	that seems random lol is it like that throughout the country or just regional
3426	1	companies will stop leaving brazil for paraguay if the new government is successful in implementing a better economic environment like you guys have maybe some will even come backon the other hand brazilian growth is good for everyone in mercosur just not 7 good
3427	1	você tá desconsiderando a parte mais importante a gnt tá falando de renda de 11k mensal por pessoa   11k da pra viver apertado em 4 em sampa mas 11k por pessoa significa que essa mesma família tem 44k pra viver
3428	1	well tell him to go to a place now renamed as neighborhood 11114 and if he goes there showing off money he gets to do adventure tourism for free the thrill of it
3429	1	cool one australian artist that is very popular here is tame impala people tell me that i look like kevin parker pretty often not really imo but whatever
3430	1	like i would pass the ideological screening
3431	1	i know i just dont have many reasons to brag about my country so when i find an opportunity i take it
3432	1	but i have been to europe many times i speak from experience when i say that the feel of for example barcelona reminds me of buenos aires i havent been to italy which as far as i know has the most similar culture to here i did say that i havent been to the usstill im not saying buenos aires is a european city or that it is literally paris it is its own thing but we were arguing if it is more similar to a us american city or a european citythe fact that people might challenge your views in a discussion forum shouldnt be surprising either especially when your claims are so bold and well practically unprecedented to tell you the truthanyway i hope you have a good time here when and if you visit
3433	1	usa was the first to become independent
3434	1	oh that is true i thought we got acre from colombia but it was in fact from boliviaah there is nothing there anyway they can have it back if they want to
3435	1	stuff like computer science electronic engineering etc are sausage parties but in my experience at uba at least maths industrial or civil engineering have a sizeable presence of women and many natural sciences like biology and chemistry are even female majority i think
3436	1	femicide does exist in chile i think its applied in the same way as in argentina
3437	1	to further explain while pronominal voseo the word vos has a stigma verbal voseo the conjugation of verbs as in querís instead of quieres while still using the word tú is completely widespread and accepted even expected in most contexts no matter the person is socioeconomic status especially by people under 50 or sothough chilean voseo conjugations are a bit different from the ones used in other countries
3438	1	they dont
3439	1	gt the imf isnt the usa most of the imf directors are europeani know but the usa is the most important board member
3440	1	all of our free trade agreements were signed under centreleft governments what are you talking about as far as i know the centreleft in uruguay is similar to the one of chile
3441	1	isnt mexico in america
3442	1	the other way around
3443	1	yeah sometimes i imagine how our country would be like politically if we had had the opportunity to develop a stable democracy all the way from 1945 till today
3444	1	hacer a argentina grande de vuelta
3445	1	thats the most ridiculous thing i have ever heardfirst  off the americans dont want to help your country they are pulling a debt trap like they have done in brazil argentina mexico ghana philippines and more recently greecesecond  i would prefer a world where the chinese the russians or even the  fucking iranians rule the world before fucking usathat place is a country that places people different to them in concentration campshttpseditioncnncom20181001opinions13000migrantchildrenhorrifyingrealitydriverindexhtml literally separating latino children from their parents and forcing them to clean the placeyeah i pass bring in the chop suey and sweetandsour sauce and take the burgers with youabout the debt trap its well known around the world   httpswwwpublicfinanceinternationalorgnews201808imfloanscanbedebttraphttpswwwpublicfinanceinternationalorgnews201808imfloanscanbedebttrap httpsenwikipediaorgwikilatin_american_debt_crisishttpsenwikipediaorgwikilatin_american_debt_crisis httptribunenetphindexphp20180926usimfdebttrapvschinawinwinhttptribunenetphindexphp20180926usimfdebttrapvschinawinwin httpswwwglobalvillagespacecomimfsdebttrapvschinesedebtpeonagehttpswwwglobalvillagespacecomimfsdebttrapvschinesedebtpeonagelmfao dude
3446	1	i mean our first colonizer was actually portugal
3447	1	tbh few exceptions aside like rapa nui chile is an incredibly homogeneous country for international standards
3448	1	theres hidden racism nobody is gonna call you names if you are black yet the average father would rather her daughters boyfriend to be white for example there are certain privilegespreferences left by the colonial era
3449	1	im seeing a lot of indians lately too lol
3450	1	because they say it too and ive never been called out on it the word negro doesnt have the same weight it does in america
3451	1	like what i know we both peruvians and chileans use huevón and weon but i never heard any unique chilean slang being said by a peruvian in a casual context
3452	1	we peruvians do it a lot as well
3453	1	they came with political training but no medical training
3454	1	no pero se tinderizó un poco
3455	1	gtbrazil could probably beat either countryhell yeah we could brazil fuck yeah
3456	1	the other user said buenos aires didnt feel that european to him as he had expected because it is a diamond in the rough as he puts it and quilombera which means something like rowdy he never draws any comparison to us american cities in fact i dont think he is even speaking of appearance and layout as we are but of the feel of the city and general experience of being here a rowdiness which btw i feel comparable to barcelona or paris and probably much of italy but i cant speak from experience theremeanwhile on a recent thread in askeurope most people seem to disagree with youhttpswwwredditcomraskeuropecommentsa19qomwhat_noneuropean_country_have_you_visited_thateanw8de there is even a usamerican user saying that bs as looks and feels like europe to himnew york is the one that i see the parallelisms with ill give you that but isnt ny the most europeanlike big city in the us anyway maybe with boston or dc it is true that many parts of buenos aires look like new york but many also look like paris or madrid in terms of the architecture of houses not apartment buildings the style that dominates is often called criollo italiano which draws influence from primarily genovese facade decor if my memory serves me right also many english style houses all of this you can only really see at street levelapart from that i dont see why you insist on showing me aerial pictures of cities i mentioned torino because it has a grid i know it will look nothing like bs as because torino has a set height for buildings you should look at streetview instead i dropped down in a random street in torino and things looked quite familiar not so in san francisco much less in chicago let alone los angeles new york again i can see it a bit but the amazing heights of ny in a such a dense grid are rare here also the architecture is just different for the most part although much of the art deco stuff wouldnt look out of place here either it is relatable yes especially in comparison to the other american cities but not as similar as madrid paris or even barcelona altough ill admit i havent visited new york it is very high on my to do listeither way were arguing on quicksand because i havent been to the us and you havent been here you seem to have a very strong opinion on this to argue with a localand one tip if you dont mind when you link to pictures or a video or a different webpage it is better to use    with text in the square brackets and the link in the round brackets that way the link will be hidden as part of the text highlighted in blue it helps to make comments less cluttered
3457	1	it is technically possible but regular people cant pay the ransom and only by plane not by boat
3458	1	gtmost people my age also remember that it happened during the exhibition of dbz specifically the episode where goku goes ss3 for the first time then the episode got cut and they didnt show it again the next daythat is a myth
3459	1	i dont get it people arent hiveminds you know that
3460	1	i completely agree it is one of the main reasons i cant get behind the feeling of latin american the region is too heterogenous ive met a lot of brazilians and colombians and their always seems to be some disconnect regarding liberalconservative behavior ive gotten quite a few comments that in comparison were a lot more stiff upper lip and reserved  which we probably would never get from anyone else in the world  i felt more in tune with the chileans ive met
3461	1	first of all america being a heterogeneous country doesnt change the fact that theyre all americans and use their heritage to appear more important than they aresecond of all i dont know if you saw my flair but im from argentina in elementary school they teach us about our country being a melting pot of races if we were as dense as americans are id be welshargentine and many of my friends and family would call themselves italianargentine basqueargentine catalanargentine frenchargentine irishargentine sicilianargentine polishargentine germanargentine turkishargentine africanargentine arabargentine jewishargentine nativeargentine slavargentine and so many more im probably forgetting not to mention the other south american countries so before you start talking about my country id suggest you at least open up wikipediathat said all of that is beside the point my main point is that i dont see how those experiences of the original immigrants have anything to do with the experiences of americans who happen to be the greatgreatgrandson of an italian immigrantthose mexicanamericans for example dont even speak spanish so i dont see how america would be a place where they are staying and mexico their home if america is the place where they were born and theyve never been to mexico as ugatogallo said theyre mexicans in america and americans in mexico that comes from the fact that they want to feel special so theyll go with whatever narrative makes them feel better which means they dont care about the pains their ancestors went through they just want to stand appart from the other americans
3462	1	evidently
3463	1	gt chart that as percentage of the worlds average pbi per capita you can do that yourself the result will be similar the sharp decline begins in 1975 not 1946
3464	1	i think it varies a lot even within france one kiss is common in brittany two is the norm in paris and the rest of the regions varies between two and even five for some people in corsica i saw a map about it not too long ago on reddit probably on rmapporn
3465	1	there is always one
3466	1	why would that be a problem it is not like bolivia has a big relevance internationally anyway
3467	1	i never understood the point of nondisposable handkerchiefs as opposed to kleenex or something like that but putting them in your pocket once theyre used or half used is normal id say not really disgusting
3468	1	do you realize how big south america is
3469	1	negro isnt the same as negro de mierda negro by itself can be another word for dude
3470	1	yes it does it is very easy to immigrate to chile from brazil because of that doesnt even need to know spanish
3471	1	parrillada
3472	1	not getting into fiscal deficit has always been priority 1 for every government so no chance of that happening in the near future
3473	1	and yet the decline doesnt happen until it abandons socialism and embraces neoliberalism whatever those words mean
3474	1	man sorry but what an ignorant asshole
3475	1	what country are you fromi dont think the part about striking up a conversation with strangers applies in argentina or at least buenos aires it is typical of crazy or old people also arent us americans supposed to talk a lot with strangers
3476	1	lots of drinking
3477	1	argentina had entered a recession in 1998 and sought assistance from the imf by the start of 2001 with the recession already a depression a double program was enacted to prevent default private debt would be refinanced at higher rates but for longer years so the short term payments were reduced and the imf would provide money through a loan each month to pay the private debt interests in exchange the imf required a series of economic measures which deepened the depression and some of which werent practicable for instance it required the federal government to privatize provincial owned banks which would be pretty much like asking obama to make texas enact gun control laws after the sitting president lost the midterms in part because of enacting part of the reforms asked by the imf the imf balked at the last payment thus precipitating the 2001 defaultso debt traps yeah weve been there we may be there now the people behind them the same people who now cry wolf for china is approach to latin america
3478	1	if congress approves the public pensions reform the prediction is 35 growth next year
3479	1	gt the cuban mentality is that we should not get involved in other people is relationshipthis used to be very true in brazil as well we even have an expression em briga de marido e mulher não se mete a colherbut today especially after the lei maria da penha this mentality is rapidly disappearing and people usually will intervene immediately if they see abuse at least in the big centersouth cities i really dont know about the countryside or the northnortheast
3480	1	life expectancy and years of schooling can tank during economic crisis  check russia is life expectancy during the 1990s
3481	1	gti believe that our biggest success was legalization of abortion in three cases wasnt it last year

3492	1	i know what an arrastão is and im not saying it doesnt happen im just stating my personal experience in the city of rio i guess you are from a not so big city in brasil its the same that happens in argentina the people from other parts of the country see buenos aires as an extremely unsafe city but actually if you ask tourists they all say its pretty safe for latinamerican standards while in copacaba i even went into the little favela at the end of rua santa clara to buy some weed and for real it felt a pretty safe humble neighborhood but again im from buenos aires so i might be a little biased edit the best salgados i had in rio were in that favela i dont remember the name of the nieghborhood though
3493	1	that happens a lot with people from the us they say things that sound extremely condescending but i dont think they always mean that
3494	1	you think china doesnt want international stability capitalism alone favours international stability i would love to continue this conversation but i have just sat at the pub and im about to order some beers sorry have a nice day
3495	1	huh really you went back to handshakes for men
3496	1	if i may id like to add a some more information on the space programas for observation satellites argentina has launched the sac series with varying levels of successthe first one sacb failed in the launch stage as far as i know the device worked correctly but couldnt be put in orbit it is objective was going to be to study the surface of the sunthen came saca which was a prototype for earth observation it worked correctly for about a year which was its calculated lifespanas saca was successful then came sacc which took images of the surface of the planet for 13 years with a designed lifespan of just 5 it was a great input for earth imagery at the time specially in the context of the failure of landsat 6 and 7 after that plus it had some experimental and secondary instruments that gave interesting resultsit was followed by sacdaquarius the platform and some instruments were done by argentina and the main instrument was nasa is aquarius which measured salinity in the oceans once calibrated it gave great results almost like measuring it in situ sadly it had some problems in the orbit calculations and only lasted about 3 yearsthe most recent one is saocom 1a which is the first one on the saocom series it is going to get radar images in the l band and to work in a constellation with saocom 1b which is scheduled to be launched in 2019 the idea is that once their lifespan is finished they are replaced with the saocom 2 series a and b as well with some improvements from thathowever before saocom 2 there is a scheduled joint program with brazil called sabiamar for coastal observation it is going to consist of 2 satellites one from each countryand in the future the idea is to implement a system of smaller satellites launched from argentina with specific instruments with a continuous launching cycle the sare program it is exciting because it has several advantages and it is seen as the future of satellite imagery
3497	1	i find it interesting and as a work of art id buy a clock like that however i think the political message is nonsensical
3498	1	its not usual at all but some people use it
3499	1	the economist says venezuela was the richest south american country between 1970 to 2001httpswwweconomistcomtheamericas20170128asvenezuelacrumblestheregimedigsin now it is amongst the poorest
3500	1	also we relied on exporting almost exclusively and didnt really begin to industrialize until yrigoyen was elected as in actually elected most prior elections were fraudulent and restrictive to deny the working class their vote but by then it was too late the great depression hit and we had our first coup in 1930 the first of many to follow which just underlines the fact that late 19th and early 20th century argentina was never economically or politically stable it was only pretending to be
3501	1	i seriously wouldnt trust an enologist that says that kind of things im sure he was jokingampx200b

3506	1	not the best sub to start a post by saying that lol
3507	1	the answer to the last question is the same as to what prevents people from spain moving in large numbers to germany for example and its not like you can move to another mercosur country and immediately start legally working there are some legalbureaucratic steps to follow
3508	1	x doubt
3509	1	you know what you are doing wrong generalizing he was talking specifically about texas being conservative now you are talking about the whole of latin america as if it was all the same
3510	1	out of all those countries only mexico is in north america under the latin american sixcontinent view

3522	1	cuil means código único de identificación laboral that is a kind of work id to legally work in argentina you have to get this id its really easy to get it but first you need to get the traditional national id and to get this you need to prove that you are not just a tourist how do you do this well by providing an address where you have permanent residence this has to be in argentina of course answering your 2nd question then the gov sends someone to check that you actually live there and thats it you are granted a provisory national id you still arent a full citizen but almost i dont know how this works in other countries
3523	1	yep i follow the same philosophy
3524	1	no one says united states for mexico or brazil not even them but you do
3525	1	this also in san juan

3537	1	what do you mean dont you drink mate inside your house we also bring mate to the parks you know
3538	1	of course you are going to need some paperwork but i would like to add that argentina has easily one of the most relaxed migratory policies of the world on paper but in addition a totally pretty corrupt and inefficient government that has 0 to none interest on regulating the migratory influx in reality
3539	1	totally the united states of the parana buenos aires entre rios santa fé uruguay rio grande do sul santa catarina and paraná should lead
3540	1	i dont know the true numbers but a recurrent joke in engineer careers is that its hard to see a woman there and bio yes it is very popular among women i thought it was the same in the us by what op said
3541	1	no comen vitel toné alla
3542	1	i dont think this directly correlational analysis is the right way to look at it argentina is problems are primarily cultural in nature in my opinion
3543	1	we dont say felices fiestas in order to not offend someone its just said that way to merge navidad and año nuevo together nothing more
3544	1	colombia bro

3550	1	calle 14 bomba estereo i never heard about those in my life
3551	1	ok then that is sad but i already made up my mind
3552	1	this current context you mean brazil in a political crisis and argentina in an economical one pacific countries have showed much more stability in both areas and integrating with two slow paced protectionist unstable giants would only make them slow down too thats my opinion and i might be wrong of course
3553	1	and that mission is please dont say world police or something along the lines of mantain peace
3554	1	basically argentina accepts every person thats reaches it no questions asked
3555	1	fuck fahrenheit give me celsius or ima go medieval on yo ass

3558	1	mbareté means force right
3559	1	think he is asking compared to other regions like central america
3560	1	se dice mid 90s
3561	1	what about south brazilian independent movement nowadays is kind of a joke but what if they grow big and influential what would you thinktawianese situation is way too different to this but i wanna know
3562	1	you merely adopted the crisis i was born in them molded by them i didnt see a stable economy until i was already a man
3563	1	you are totally wrong in the last part we know we are all latinamericans and some of us southamericans what we dont like is the use of the term latino in the sense people from the us doand besides that american in english is correct both meaning someone from the us and someone from the entire land mass of america sourcehttpsenoxforddictionariescomdefinitionamericangt 11 a native or inhabitant of any of the countries of north south or central america ampx200bampx200b
3564	1	i live in mar del plata and i think strangers will talk to each other as long as something triggers it like there is a demonstration in the street and someone mumbles something then whoever is next might add something or show support
3565	1	the soviets dont exist since early 90s but the us has for these last 30 years been involved in conflicts all over the world all along many of those conflicts directly or indirectly caused by the us
3566	1	also you only mentioned chile how did the rest of south america did after the interventions good or bad
3567	1	what i find racist in that context is that they label how an indio should look like thats why i asked what color is indio what are the other options if you are not indio color
3568	1	choo choo
3569	1	yeah the military bombing a goverment building and killing the president seems like a very violent response
3570	1	oh youre right sorry
3571	1	yes i had no idea i believe that was the only cab i took while i was there
3572	1	gt there are some things that the majority should not be able to do and those are codified as laws that is also the point of representative government but the people responsible of striking that balance are your representatives gt denying gay marriage is the same logic but with tax benefits and family issues instead of deathwhat youre doing here is an interpretation and a pretty extreme and bad one at that with all due respect im not sure what you mean by by the same logic because it is not the same logic murder is already a crime codified by law and based on a specific constitutional right i dont know where youre from but surely it has right to not be murdered it is not some abstract reasoning that counteracts the push of the majority but those specific legal lines of the constitutionas it happens constitutions are probably not worded to specifically provide for gay marriage so to some extent even if it is a law it is subject to the back and forth of politics murder is not because you need to amend constitution to legalize murder you are confusing a legal and political level of analysis with an ethical level of analysisdont get me wrong if you asked me should we amend the constitution to clearly allow for gay marriage my answer would be unquestionably yes but until it is a well established custom in a society protected by a solid set of law and institutional inertia it is our duty as citizens to keep fighting even if we already won a battle legalization for example as it can be a fickle thingbtw i just realized all of our debate is technically pointless in this thread because were talking about cuba and it is not a representative democracy lol
3573	1	i think he means liberal as in the english meaning of the term
3574	1	in 81 and 95 but were minor wars and we sold ecuador the weapons lol actually we sold them non functioning weapons if i recall correctly as we did with croatia argentine bussiness 101
3575	1	yeah its some kind of game we have insulting other people we actually expect the other to insult back the more inventive the insult the better
3576	1	gt said something about foreign bank accountsthat is me that that is the best way to do it doesnt mean that it is normal also it was a tip for expats who can surely keep a bank account in their country of origin
3577	1	haha yes they had funny looking lips now that i rememberthere were 4 main characters 2 siblings a guy with glasses aka the nerd and another boy i believe he was like the dumb one or the extrange one i dont really remember tbhthe girl was named reggie which sounds quite similar to riley
3578	1	in argentina it is not unusual to have cheektocheek greetings between men it usually happens when you already know they guy but sometimes it just happens maybe you arent paying attention and go for the cheek thing it is not a big deal this of course does not apply to a formal meeting
3579	1	lol what who do you think we are man thats not true at all surely there are people with overseas bank accounts but thats not usual
3580	1	do you really think everyone is able to buy dollars a lot of people has informal jobs so that is not true either
3581	1	well at least as far as i know macedonia was the only republic that got out of yugoslavia peacefully while the rest teared each other apart
3582	1	gt  people that fought the falklands war are highly respectedi see them more as victims and i feel sad for them the issue of the malvinas just cant be discussed freely unless you completely agree with the opinion of the majority anything else is highly frowned upon
3583	1	gt it is a man assassinating a woman because of her condition of womanhoodwhat this means is that the motivation for the crime is related directly to the person is condition as a woman this is to distinguish for example a mugging gone wrong that ends in murder from a woman being cornered in an alley and getting raped and beaten to death of course youre not gonna find discreet lines that separate a femicide from a regular homicide and there may be a lot of mixed situations but that is why we have judges
3584	1	in his examples he means straight up central america
3585	1	we use felices fiestas in argentina when we want to sum up merry christmas and a happy new year felices fiestas covers both of them
3586	1	as did many others it seems that it wasnt exclusive from their countries
3587	1	just to add we sometimes even kiss hello total strangers
3588	1	si totalmente es por un tema de comodidad tambien pero tecnicamente es una propina hay gente que le reclama hasta la ultima moneda que no esta mal hacerlo tampoco
3589	1	votan a olmedo
3590	1	it is mostly a football rivalry
3591	1	is there anyone who isnt going to be offended if you call them egocentric assholes
3592	1	and
3593	1	uruguays accent is pretty much the same as santa feentre rios accent thats why its a little different
3594	1	it wasnt completely a joke were just used to this kind of stuff so while we dont really solve those issues we just carry on
3595	1	clarifying that for mefyi
3596	1	villa crespo is the traditional jew neighborhood
3597	1	lol this is the perfect summary of all latin american people the one time our country does something good we go full throttle with that
3598	1	by context you mean depends if youre surrounded by white people or people youve heard saying negro de mierda beforeyou wouldnt say los negros de mierda or just los negros meaning something bad surrounded by poor brown people or in a bus or in an office or professional environment you wouldnt say it loudly in a restaurant you wouldnt say it around a brown person you just met you probably wouldnt say it around people youve just met in general for fear of being labeled a facho you probably wouldnt say in the university depends on which university i guess it would be frowned upon in the majority of situations actually except around your close friends and reddit
3599	1	well i dont think interventions are good coming from one side or another but historically speaking us interventions caused a lot more deaths than the soviet ones
3600	1	gt guilty of starving and killing dozens of millions of innocent peopleare you talking about capitalism feudalism socialism or slavery
3601	1	yeah youre right but there comes another funny thing all federal countries in america are actually united states of america too in the sense that they are all unions of semi autonomuos states situated in america yankeeland is better sedit and what should we call a hypothetical union organization of all american countries united states of america of course
3602	1	you didnt even watched the video that man even talks about that island
3603	1	yep living in mendoza can confirm but only between womanwoman and manwoman between manman is only one kiss as normal
3604	1	kelvin is fine never fahrenheit
3605	1	lol we have the same game in argentina that when you see a vw beetle the first to see it can punch the others we call it poncho
3606	1	yeah it depends for example i have heard mexicans saying simply los estados for the usa as in the states that would never be the case in argentina here the name of the country is always estados unidos not the states nor america
3607	1	gthttpsiimgurcom54abjknpngchart that as percentage of the worlds average pbi per capita or chart our pbi as percentage of the worlds pbi that graph doesnt say anything at all pbi has been increasing since millenia
3608	1	nice saying in argentina theres a similar but slightly different one el que no llora no mama
3609	1	not adjusted for inflation  ppp makes this a lot less useful
3610	1	hey hey dont give them ideas they chose chile so chile it is bad luck mate
3611	1	if the service is bad id leave the coin or bill of the lowest possible denomination the idea would be to send a message that you were not satisfied
3612	1	that is because people here and in most places in the world id imagine get their general knowledge of canada mostly from yankee entertainment and content if people grew up with infoman alongside the simpsons or canadians made up the majority of this site instead of yankees they might have a more nuanced view of our country than nicer us with cheaper healthcare
3613	1	gt yes in a direct democracyyou mean indirectgt there are certain rights that should be preservedyes the ones codified in the constitution and international pacts i was assuming that since that is pretty basic republican democracy yes there is a constitution that codifies basic inalienable rights as a countermajoritarian mechanism gay marriage is not one of themgt if every citizen is equal then they shouldnt get a say on people being able to marry or not because of their sexual orientationthis is an interpretation that a supreme court must make not even a law would be effective enough what is most effective is cultural pressure and institutional inertia after legalization actually but all that can be undone with a sharp consrevative turn in society as we are witnessinggt thats why many countries legalized samesex marriage through the supreme court or equivalentbut until that is not the case it is politically up for grabs that is a fact im not happy about it
3614	1	indeed they are
3615	1	left  communismisnt the 70 of the industry still in hands of private sector
3616	1	do you seriously belive that the violence was generated by the left groups instead of the military dictatorship
3617	1	yeah it pretty easy but first you gotta get your national id card cuil too in the case of argentina and for this you have to prove you dont have a criminal record in you country of origin and prove some kind of permanent residence
3618	1	by whom
3619	1	todo para decir que anda por nordelta s
3620	1	i think i could identify an uruguayan because they say tú a lot more than we do
3621	1	the usa has fuck to do with taiwan wtf thats some deep ass lefties conspiracy ya no shit of course the us will back the capitalist government that had to flee to taiwan and then prc starved half their country
3622	1	lmao
3623	1	you mean afganistán siria and iran or vietnam
3624	1	gt you could just walk away without looking like a terrible  shitheaddebatablewaiters at restaurants are tipped 10    waiters at bars are tipped 510    waiters at busy bars with mediocre attention are barely tipped 5   delivery drivers are tipped between 2 and 8 probably some combination of 5 10 or 20 peso bills for orders that are normally 200500 pesos and thankfully that is all the tips we do in argentina why would i tip a cab driver
3625	1	hmm european countries are quite a big set i dont think it is the same being colonized by the british like south africa was or being colonized by the spanish the french or the dutch
3626	1	smash your face with the keyboardueudhavsgdh
3627	1	you are right martínez de hoz was a socialist now his name makes sence
3628	1	yeah you chileans and you brazilians should start making proper toilets im tired of dropping the paper inside and then having to ask for a bucket of water to make it go through when travelling over there and man what the fuck are those electricity plugs you arent making it any easier for us to keep buying electronics from you
3629	1	gtstrong football leagueswait whaaaat
3630	1	gt if a socialist burocrat decidethen the relationships of production of the capitalist system remains the same the workers does not have control over what they produce
3631	1	yeah ok but i mean what color is indio kinda brownish that feels a lot more racist that just stating a race
3632	1	not really i watched the video because someone talked about it on this very subreddit and i found it hilarious
3633	1	not a military base
3634	1	ironically enough the only people i know whove had horse meat are all canadian
3635	1	depends in the buenos aires province that is not common but i know it happens frequently in mendoza
3636	1	no man thats only for tourists in normal shops all over the country they only accept pesos no dollars no reais no euros normal rents are always in pesos only tourism apartments are paid in dollars properties are sold and bought in dollars thats true
3637	1	for real

3639	1	si posta
3640	1	bananas everywhere we have a very limited fruit offer down here i was truly amazed when i went to brazil and saw all that kind of strange to me fruits being sold
3641	1	what if you were forced to choose

3646	1	went on vacation
3647	1	ive seen a couple of people from some province kiss twice i forget which province but it is certainly not the norm
3648	1	we have the exact same concept in argentina unfortunately they are called trapitos very similar name they wave a rag at you
3649	1	so much this
3650	1	yeah its more about respecting the home they obviously know the girl isnt virgin anymore
3651	1	i have been to rio and copacabana a couple of times and never saw anything strange actually felt quite safe even at night on the beach i felt much more danger in lapa at night
3652	1	and why not make mercosur active again dont get me wrong im not vouching for mercosur i dont care which name they choose to name the southamerican integration organization i just think that national policies first and foremost should be aimed towards southamerican integration if thats what we want if each country doesnt get that first then no organization will work and the problem is both brazil and argentina say they want free market but happen to always enforce protectionist policies so i think pacific alliance states would be better without argentina or brazil messing with it at least for now
3653	1	koreatown in flores as well
3654	1	in mendoza they do it twice at least the people i know
3655	1	no man when the independence revolution started in montevideo 1811 one year after buenos aires revolution backed by artigas in present day uruguay it was all part of the united provinces in 1815 still part of the united provinces banda oriental organized a federalist movement against buenos aires centralism supported by many argentine provinces the liga federal in 1816 the kingdom of brazil invaded the territory and it wasnt until 1822 that brazil got independence correct me if im wrong yes the portuguese did set a colony in colonia del sacramento before but brazil didnt even exist back then and the spanish founded montevideo so they did care about colonizing the territory
3656	1	gt  and its not like you can move to another mercosur country and immediately start legally working there are some legalbureaucratic steps to followactually it is pretty much like that
3657	1	lol you are completely right in everythingi had this discussion a few days agomira amiguito llevo toda mi vida viviendo en sudhttpswwwredditcomraskredditcommentsa6y2fawhat_lie_were_you_led_to_believe_until_growing_upec4necwutm_sourceredditandroid
3658	1	gtno one attempted to resolve the real issues behind ops threadobviously nobody gives a shit about soy luna and violeta lol
3659	1	i meant morally afaik according to your laws tips are officially part of the waiters salary so you could be easily causing them to receive less that the minimum in a way
3660	1	it was normal but now it is very rare my grandmother used to handkerchiefs but she is like 104 years old nownonblood related
3661	1	no its cultural not generational latin people living in us lose a lot of their original cultureedit i dont understand why they are downvoting you you just stated your opinion

3664	1	once i thought a chilean guy was from santiago del estero argentinian province so yeah we suck at accents
3665	1	surprised to see angra on that list love that band
3666	1	it is cutters in argentinahowever you just made me realize that the tortas de jamon were sandwiches all along so thank you
3667	1	not the case here really it is all about english italian and french
3668	1	i know a black argentine woman she says that kids were rather insensitive when she was a young girl probably because they had never seen another black person before and kids always pick on outliers this is my analysis  then as an adult she encounters some assholes but most people treat her like anybody else   her nickname predictably is la negra  im not sure how i would feel if my nickname were specifically my minority race but she doesnt seem to have a problem with it nor do most people nicknamed negro and negra
3669	1	thats extremely common and isnt offensive at all people will call you el gordo el flaco el negro el whatever its not done with bad intentions i believe you are judging us from a different culture with different historyand kids are unfortunately always insensitive and awful they will pick any trait in you and turn it into an insult if they dont like you
3670	1	i use this too and not in a derogatory way i find yanqui shorter than estadounidense and i dont like saying americano or norteamericano
3671	1	hace bastante más de 3 años que el peso se viene devaluando a niveles ridículos ver peso mn peso ley peso argentino austral peso convertible en total 13 ceros te pensás que es un problema de ahora

3673	1	oh so the us is atlas with the world on his shoulders yeah right lol
3674	1	wouldnt say ridiculous just different and funnyedit o flair diz argentina mas eu sou br
3675	1	i dont have anything against you i understand why you say american as in people from the usa in spanish theres a word you dont have in english estadounidense basically unitedstatian so its perfectly possible to differentiate between bothpeople normaly use americano meaning something from the continent of america remember we learn that the whole of america is only one continent not like you that learn that south and north are two different continents and its used to mean someone from the us too sometimes but its not so widespread because we have that beautiful word estadounidense and people that say americano meaning that are many times corrected by otherstldr yes we totally use american meaning people from every country in america
3676	1	it is a good analysis of the statistics but there is very very little information about the economic causes of those statisticsand even less about possible solutions the end is baffling it recommends ideological healing to ensure growthgt a first step would be to follow policies that would allow to go back to the share of the us gdppc that prevailed from 1945 to 1975a first step to being a developed nation would be to follow policies that put us back on track to being a developed nation wow give this man a nobel prize gt but to do that it would be wise to discard the hundredyeardecline myth with its longing for an argentine golden era that never wassure talking about the dictatorship some more will make us rich again
3677	1	that doesnt mean hes gonna get his ass kicked you need a strong oposition candidate first and there is none
3678	1	someone from the continent of america right
3679	1	that is just to show how little we know about the rest of the world we arent a shithole despite how much people think we all are also people here say that we are the best just to piss all of you off
3680	1	id call him a racist fucking moron but i guess ignorant does it
3681	1	gt the economy minister is promising to shrink inequalitywhat is he supposed to say that the rich will be richer and the poor poorer
3682	1	nono he isnt talking about youtubers lol luisito comunica is great he is talking about football commentators
3683	1	yeah in spanish too but its kinda slang un policia de paisano means a policeman without his uniform at least in argentina
3684	1	i never intended to say you dont know your own country im sorry if thats what you understood of course not i get what you are saying and of course its a violent city but a city that i personally would totally go back again as many times as i can until i get robbed of course p
3685	1	gt we let in involvement of religion in politics way too muchim not defending this but governments represent their people and if their people believe this stuff then it is only natural that progress doenst happen it is absolutely legitimate at the political level that a people is beliefs impact on their government is decision making that is the point of representative democracy to representnow if a silent majority gets shoved around by a vocal minority you can hardly blame the vocal minority for voicing their concern or the governments for preserving their political capital i blame the silent majority sitting at home it shouldnt be just gay people making this demand but everyone that agrees with itregarding the involvement of religion institutionally in politics literally every interest group lobbies governments that is why they are interest groups
3686	1	for the sake of the corporations
3687	1	depends from which part of cordoba she is the district accent is mostly from the provinces capital rest of the province varies

3691	1	that was a very interesting wellthought post

3693	1	no that is europe in general in europe if they kiss they kiss twice i think
3694	1	thats disrespectful to all kind of grilled meat of south america s
3695	1	i sometimes do that but i round up to the nearest 0 or 5 i consider it more of a change issue than a tip  it is much quicker and faster to tell them to keep the change but i dont take is as a tip partly because it is such a small amount for both parties involved
3696	1	i understand why it could be seen as attractive but i cant stop thinking of the chanclas my granma wore only a little higher
3697	1	coatíes are nice to look but total motherfuckers in reality
3698	1	the problem here is portugal didnt settle the eastern bank as a whole it settled one city not the whole of uruguays territory and that city was contested many times between portugal and spain way before argentina and brazil even exist as political entities if you want to avoid any misunderstanding you may have regarding your last paragraph you dont wanna talk about argentine internal problems but uruguays first autonomic gov and later independence comes directly from argentine internal struggles for independece and are deeply intertwined and i mean what the fuck man i really intended to have a nice conversation but bringing the falklands issue talking about whining you are just another riograndense with inferiority complex im sure
3699	1	the reason why the argentinean dictatorship fucked the economy was because unlike chile it increased government spending it didnt reduce it it was also protectionist af

3708	1	sorry but this is sort of against the facts in the late 1960s argentina had very low poverty measurements and the highest educated populace south of the rio grandei feel the oligarchy was greedy for power and control but not necessarily for money argentina made great investments during the 18501950 period in many areas to become a modernized state and you can witness this just walking around buenos aires and seeing the buildings and comparing that with other latin american citiesbuilding the uba for example is something the oligarchy didim not defending them by any stretch of the imagination but availability of education and poverty have only been real problems in argentina since 1986 give or take our problems were much more institutional an political in nature than demographical in my opinion

3737	1	gtthe overthrow of hugo chavez would not have us starving todayeh probably would have been the same but instead of a consequence of chavez it would have been the internal turmoil and power struggles that would have followed unless they managed to do a very clean and precise strike with people ready to step upand that kind of people would probably be those power hungry enough to be bad news

3755	1	america is the name of the country thoughit is like south africa it is not the only country in southern africa but is named after its location

3780	1	using enem the standardized university admission exam kinda like usa is sats as a metric60 of the candidates choose spanish the number goes from 50 southeast to 73 north however the average grade is 45 for english while spanish is only 34the thing is spanish seems very simple it has a similar root to portuguese and most brazilians can understand simple spanish texts simply because the vocabulary is quite similar to portuguese so people who know neither language well will choose spanishbut the number of people who actually speak spanish is much lower which explains why the grade is so bad since this is an exam that tests more specific language skills people who choose english tend to have a better grasp at the languageusing another example language schools are very common here in some cities youll see 2 or 3 language schools in the same neighborhood in these schools they usually teach english spanish french italian german japanese etc english is by far the most popular language with the biggest number of students
3781	1	lmao most homicides in those cases are made using guns or knivesregardless of that when we compare male partners being possessive and violent towards their female partners versus the opposite the difference is huge in statistics it is not only because of the physical capacity of being effectively violent but it also has a lot to do with feeling empowered to do so  which is a direct consequence of social constructi just want to understand why the sexist possibility sounds so unthinkable to you it feels like youre trying too hard to prove that gender roles and expectations dont play any importance here i just want to understand why that possibility bothers you so much i hope you are not more committed to your own beliefs for whatever reasons than to rational argumentation otherwise i will stop here

3794	1	gtall immigrants dont necessarily want to become americanized especially those from africa the middle east and south asia is there a similar phenomenon in brasilnot that i can point out brazilian culture is not really an imposing one you can be extremely traditional of most other cultures and still reflect the brazilian culture perfectlygtlastly is there not a strong correlation between class and race in brasil im sure that white and asian brasilians are the richest just as white and asian americans are the richest here with asians being the richest group of americans it certainly is the case in many countries not just america i dont think there is a strong correlation with asians but yes there is very much with black and white people and yes we are sadly quite racist too but the thing is economic class is such a powerful thing here that if you are black but rich from birth you will most likely absorb the same culture as everyone else from the upper class and no one will find this outlandish it is the same way around as well with poor white peoplethe one exception to this are people that changed economic classes i consider myself one of those as my parents started their lives on minimum wages but as the time passed my dad managed to save some money and open his own bussiness for example my friends often call me stingy as i take my time considering purchases dont throw serviceable goods away if they stop being brand new dont care for useless branding and dont distance myself from workers like janitors or drivers those are automatic for them but something that i always notice

3803	1	gtportugal didnt settle the eastern bank as a wholeneither did spain until they started rushing heaps of people in and to be honest it is not like the hinterlands of the country are still very populous you know so that argument doesnt seem very valid to megtas political entities if you want to avoid any misunderstanding you may have regarding your last paragraphof course brazil existed as a political entity then just because we didnt have the awful spanish colonial system of viceroyalties it doesnt mean we didnt have a colonial government or representation in the portuguese court no wonder we even gained the constituentnation status within the empiregtbut uruguays first autonomic gov and later independence comes directly from argentine internal struggles for independece and are deeply intertwinedwell too bad still was ours and tbh i dont care if theyre independent now theyre entitled to that as long as they dont join argentina and i quite like argentina actually lol

3871	1	the bushes the clintons al gore mitt romney the average brazilian is more likely to know these people than to be able to differentiate hu jintao and xi jinping by looking at a picture of either of them

3876	1	dont need to be aggressive you know
3877	1	it is not really a union it is just a treaty we have i believe it started as a mercosul thing and then the other countries joined the treaty much like europe is schengen thing we can reside in any other mercosul country  bolivia and chile and travel through all south american countries without a passport just our national id card
3878	1	awwww we love you guys

3884	1	still couldnt you come with a better name for your union i mean united states of america is just not creative at all why not pick a native word or something like canada and mexico did
3885	1	mercosul isnt a political union at all o_o

3891	1	indeed if you are fluent youll face no troubles in the worst case scenario people will think you are a brazilian with a funny accent but most likely theyll react positively can even score some points with the girls

3903	1	wat about venezuela tho
3904	1	they the people who worry abt it already think our schools indoctrinate our children into communismsocialism  is full conspiracy mode at this point
3905	1	i was thinking also of the  sword republichttpsptwikipediaorgwikirepc3bablica_da_espada when the military deposed the emperor in a coup détat so basically our republic was born as a dictatorship
3906	1	yeah true

3919	1	the dude frequents rhapas dont even bother with this one
3920	1	i mean the latino culture not exactly asian still what youve said just proved my point this cultural differences do exist in us doe to different ancestries that doesnt happen in brazil maybe because immigration happened in the xix century and xx so it isnt that recent there are a few people that actually care about it but majority doesnt anyway what im saying that is latin america people dont care that much about that compared to americans that is all the reasons for it can be various and would require a more complex discussionedit sorry about any mistakes im a bit drunk
3921	1	that is exactly the bad part
3922	1	as a southern brazilian id say argentina and uruguay are very similar to us culturallybesides that none
3923	1	im not going to ask anything if you want to know that then go over on raskanamerican and post such question
3924	1	im advocating simple knowledge about concepts that you dont seem to grasp adequately

3932	1	the us has not been benign at all at least to the continent in the south of them they have worked within their own interests every time if us public pressed for transparency or a stoppage of action thats on the strength of how their public work but everytime the government could get away with it they did geez just look at their initial support of pol potis useless to fabricate a oppression olympics and see which imperialist force was worse they have been terrible always
3933	1	it is probably supposed to be an argument against the whole but brazil is so diverse shouldnt they know better than to elect a fascist shpiel that people on reddit have been reproducing since the election
3934	1	not a problem at all if crimeans want to be russians and russia wants crimeans its finethe tricky part is the land as an economical asset the debate about who owns the land its people or its governament is a very complex one and i really dont have a good argument for itits really a tough scenario but if the crimeans are happy im fine with that
3935	1	punta del este gt

3942	1	how integrated are comunidad andina and alianza del pacífico economicwise mercosul is basically a bunch of protectionists countries vetoing each other
3943	1	i think he means to ask if women are also involved with sex tourism in a role other than that of the prostitute like a pimp or a procurer or something like that
3944	1	gtthis is a really broad sweeping claim  do you have anything to back it upif youre really american i doubt based on your coments you should know your own country was the most protetionist until the second world war and this was a deliberate policy to protect american infant industries since the end of the american war of independence and they had learned it with britain another protetionist powerhorse now neoliberal think tanks based on usa sell the desilusional idea that protetionism is bad and free trade is good while usa did the contrary in the past
3945	1	you only know because you seemingly live there it is expectedim talking about the regular usamericanlooking forward to hear what you think about the periphery of epirus in greece nonetheless
3946	1	not trolling it just happens that the kind of latin americans who come to this sub are the kind that loves to be a dog for european and north american powers they believe if they behave well they will be given some cookies
3947	1	hydro has adverse effects on the aquatic environments that are disrupted
3948	1	despite the maracanazo brazillians love uruguay although ive seen some edgy teenagers talking about the idea of uruguay still being a brazillian territory they are only trying to be cool and nationalistic also almost all brazillians know about uruguay the only exceptions are very poor people and young kids
3949	1	i dont doubt you brazil and china are the biggest trading partners of uruguay and by a large marging compared to us 3rd
3950	1	it sounded gross when my brother told me he did that but then he convinced me to try it and it turns out it is just so yummy join the dark side broski it is worth it
3951	1	southern brazilian here and your direct neighbour by borderthe south brazil thing is fucking pathetic only loonies and old people take them seriously they want to create a country that basically doesnt even have an actual name nor historical reason to existthis movement really has no credibility amongst educated or young people they even tried to pull a catalonia and make an informal referendum but it was a joke because you could basically vote more than once and reportedly people in a town in santa catarina have seen some ballot paper boxes they were made of carton drifting in the wind spreading the votes all over the street
3952	1	there are forums about this just google lei direito feminicidio como agravante it has to be specific the op you replied to already posted the example when a woman is killed because of her womanhood  usually by a partner usually rape  murder is included and sometimes when a parent murders a daughter depending on reasoning of crime its different from a violent robbery a shooting etc since most  women murdered in brazil are murdered by their partners anyway the distinction gets muddled
3953	1	to expand on that what he means by true vowels is that when we hear english vowels we sometimes can hear 2 distinct sounds being said one after the other for example a papper sounds to us like our ei peiper brpt has very consistent sounds to the point that it is very rare to have to ask how to pronunciate a word if you have it written in front of you so when someone tries to use english vowels with portuguese it sounds like both the wrong vowels and doubling themhere is my best attempt at how our vowels should sound to youa  like a in fathere  like the e in paymenti  like the ee in meeto  like the o in longu  like the oo in boot
3954	1	so how is it any different from america asians are just regular brazilians but at the same time theyre different in a way that harkens back to their ascendancy and traditional culture same as america right
3955	1	estados unidos da américa usa in portuguese it was habit
3956	1	i guess jews are clean idk
3957	1	only from developed countries you sure
3958	1	how is it circlejerky
3959	1	the dollar exchange rate growth i guess
3960	1	i dont care where or when this revolution or whatever started this is not the point at all what happened in argentinian internal history is completely irrelevant  it is simple logic  portugal settles the eastern bank gt the kingdom of brazil declares independence from the ukpba gt uruguay is part of the kingdom of brazil therefore becomes part of the brazilian empire  no matter how much argentinians whine about it it was rightfully ours im not saying we should invade and annex it or some bullshit like that but it is a fact that it was a portuguese colony and therefore we shouldve inherited it but it is okay because the brits took revenge for us with the falklands d  alsogt yes the portuguese did set a colony in colonia del sacramento before but brazil didnt even exist back then  what the actual fuck my good sir
3961	1	and were unhappy when you guys snatch the name of our continent _ツ_
3962	1	i personally see no problem in it being mandatory the issue itself is far from that imho

3970	1	gtbut due their romantic relationshipampx200bwhich on a straight relationship usually men dominate and most of those crimes are related to men not accepting the woman is decision to break up or finding out she has cheated on him which i hope you dont find to be a good reason for killing someonethat is intrinsically linked to sexism this underlying idea that a man owns his female partner
3971	1	did you go to a public school a find it amazing how they didnt teach me shit about the natives and barely talked about precolumbian civilizations also might not be our country but they completely ignore a lot of important history i remember being eager to hear about the mongolians and asia but not even a fucking word so many fucking classes learning about ww2 what a waste
3972	1	no you cant but youre too dumb to grasp your own contradictions another trait closely linked to both material and intellectual mediocrity useless types such as you are irrelevant
3973	1	great analysis couldnt have put it better myself and my family also did benefit from it too but nowlet is just say that my family has lowered its standard as much the own country which only makes me hate even more those artifical means that were used for growth

3978	1	my mother says that too but she also says that back then you used to have to pass a test to be able to go to a public school like an enem of sorts you cant really compare a public education system that is just for a few with one that is inclusive of everyone
3979	1	mercosul is south america it doesnt include central america it is on the name mercosul sul  south and even if it included central america you still need money to get to the country and money to survive there not everyone would be able to do so

3982	1	we have 3 different types of bananas that you can find in any supermarket across the country any time of the year banana nanica  dwarf cavendish the regular banana you probably get where you live banana prata  i dont think this one is known outside of brazil and yet it is the most popular variety here banana da terra  plaintains which are cookedbakedfried to eatthen there are 2 other varieties which are somewhat common but not as easy to find as their availability can vary depending on the season and region of the country banana maçã  apple banana banana ouro  ladyfinger banana

3989	1	i get a lot of costumers from chile at the store i work for mostly women i think most of them are just average looking attractive ones are rarehowever brazil is incredibly cheap for chileans which is why they buy a lot here so perhaps due to that there isnt the automatic association that we usually make in brazil that if you travel to another country you are at the very least upper middle class possibly filthy rich
3990	1	oh my sides
3991	1	same for brazil i remember reading an article in portuguese explaining that
3992	1	you have no idea of what socialism is do you
3993	1	argentina growth is pretty important for brazil too they import like 70 of cars exportations   but macri banned more imports shrug  httpseconomiaestadaocombrnoticiasgeralargentinamultaimportacaodecarrodobrasil70001923618
3994	1	english however not a lot of people know english so if you are going to go on a trip to brazil its perhaps better to know spanish due to being close enough to our language
3995	1	it is honduras
3996	1	and meat
3997	1	gt the fate of south america is intertwined with how the spanish and portuguese dont quote me too hard on them handled the extraction of resources from south america they just plundered everything and took it back to europe the french dutch and british focused on trading trading requires a certain amount of trust and mutual benefit to actually worki disagree with you there i think it largely has to do with the lack of a political welfare culture and collective mindset blaming spain and portugal is a too easy solution and does nothing but take our guilt off our shoulders i also think it is unfair to classify the colonial time at least the portuguese one merely as plundering had they only plundered there wouldnt be a huge portuguese community in brazil even today and we wouldnt even speak their language or have common cultural traits brazil is essentially a portuguese creation  there hardly would be brazil without portugal if you look back in history youll see that the portuguese i cant speak for the spaniards did a lot more than just extract resources and go away and im not talking only about brazillooking up to the colonial models from the netherlands france and the uk is also very fishy to me need i remind you that haiti suriname and belize were colonies of these countriestheyre definitely not better economically and politically than most former iberian colonies if you ask me with a few punctuation exceptionsim sorry but that is a very shallow historical analysis and it is largely delusional to think argentina would be better if it were british and brazil better if it were dutch or even venezuela better if it were germanon a second note im not saying colonisation doesnt have any effects up to this very day but let is get real weve been independent for enough time now
3998	1	are you sure i live in the south and never heard that i think you may be confusing gringo with colono but that is not exclusive to italians though
3999	1	gt i also heard people mostly on the left invoke entreguismo in relation to petrobras and the sale of the presalt fields saying that allowing foreign companies instead of the state oil company to extract oil would be handing over the brazilian people is wealth to foreign actors petrobras is the largest brazilian company and sustain a large part of productive chain in brazilian industry relinquishing presal to foreign companies instead of petrobras hurt large part of brazilian industry and consenquently generates unemploymentgt given that the pt was busy using petrobras to enrich itself at the expense of the people over the past decade casting foreign business as the sole villain here seems like a bit of a blind spot of course it is not like the private sector has a much better track recordbullshit if the corruption is the problem solve the corruption problem but these people who complain about this are not interested in this mostly of them are paid to make propaganda through think tanks based on usa they use corruption as an excuse to sell the idea that entreguismo is good it is their only argument as i had said all these entreguismo process is based on corruption
4000	1	now you do
4001	1	well there always a little bit of will towards integrating all latin america into a single nation since we all have a very similar cultural makeup history and we all know deep in our hearts that only we can care for each otherampx200bthat said diplomatic bickering is also a very proeminent trait of latinamerican nations so it is probably unlikely we will get there would be cool tho
4002	1	yes its true
4003	1	the context was war against radical leftists who kidnapped killed robbed banks and attempted to turn brazil into another cuba
4004	1	youre one of the few lucky ones then that happens all the time with pretty much everyone
4005	1	under the subscribe option in the sub there is supposed to be an option show my flair i agree thats how great powers work tho honestly even if theyre not great powers just look at how hungry russia still is im not antiamerican per se but i do think the countrys actions have had negative consequences for other nations  but i will concede that it would have been like that with another country
4006	1	men dont usually get killed for reasons associatioed with their condition as a man they get killed  for many reasons almost in every case women though are killed mostly from reasons linked to their gender roles and expectations e g  husband is jealousy
4007	1	most of the time it is but ive seen people legitimaly saying that the portuguese stole the gold in brazil
4008	1	fine then not sichuan ask them what they know about paraná here in brazil or cordoba in argentinai vehemently advise you to create ralcacirclejerk by all means
4009	1	unless they are from mexico i dont expect them know anything about either of these states
4010	1	this isnt correct in brazil the order is reversed so it is like personal name mother is family name father is family name the paternal name is still the one that takes precedence
4011	1	to be fair the army was thrown there and told to fix it
4012	1	maybe you shouldnt held today americans responsible for something their grandparents did although i do believe you should after all it is in their power to repair the damage and they dont seem to do soand of course we should held people responsible for the decisions of the politicians they put in power unless we accept that democracy is a lie
4013	1	there are probably hundreds of videos on the internet of large groups of muggers just getting to the beach closing it off and running after people to rob them literally in other words it is not an infrequent occurrence if you do decide to go take small amounts of cash and the clothes on your back that is it no phones wallets nothing that you will miss if it is goneit is like a scene from a moviehere are some picshttpsogloboglobocomrioarrastaoemcopacabanadeixamoradoresapreensivos20114043httpsogloboglobocomrioarrastaoemcopacabanadeixamoradoresapreensivos20114043
4014	1	i dont really get how this relates to what was said tbh switzerland was never a colony of spainportugal either and even if it was it didnt get rich by reliance on extractivism
4015	1	i interpreted it as doing the opposite of what latin america did ie gt entreguismo is the belief that our country have to be dependent of a powerhorse like usa and thus it have to relinquish all of our natural resources and companies to international agents destroying national industry and internal market and transfering weathy jobs to developed countries maybe i wouldnt put it down in exactly the same terms but the general idea seems fair
4016	1	i agree with you there  on a second note ive lived in portugal for some time it sadly is a thing there indeed italy too
4017	1	rio is pretty nice during the winter not too hot not too cold and during the summer there are the super hot days but it rains a lot which brings the temperature down a littlei think the temperature in the northeastern capitals is worse the temperatures dont get as high as rio in those super hot days but because the summer is the dry season it is hot all the time and still quite humid winter is also much hotter than rio is wintermanaus is also probably much worse and cuiabá has more hot like hell days than rio

4036	1	so did you move out when you became a man
4037	1	people are always saying that but all i know is that every now and then someone will come around and write a post on rbrasil asking why asians have the best test scores and get into the best universities and that is usually enough to make people talk about how it is a matter of how the traditional culture emphasizes discipline how asians are raised with parents who beat and disown their kids over unsatisfactory test results how theyre always committing suicide because the pressure to succeed is so high and everything it just doesnt sound like the kind of stuff someone who thinks youre the same as them would sayif youre not an rbrasil subscriber you can just type por que os japonesesasiáticosorientais são tão inteligentesdisciplinadosmetódicos on google and watch people is guesses im pretty sure everyone has been a part of a conversation like that at least once in their lives anyway

4088	1	the period of economic growth late 60s to early 70s also culminated into massive inflation years later mostly because said growth happened on the ground of foreign loans in the first place the military government did use that money to build infrastructure such as the rioniterói bridge for example helping the economy by creating new jobshowever as the oil crisis hit later that also implied in rise of the interest rates and as brazil already had a huge debt by that point the country basically broke in the 80s that decade is described as década perdida in brazilian history the lost decade there was crazy inflation when the prices were changing within the day people had to rush to do groceries as soon as they got paid because otherwise their money would be worthlessdictatorship lasted until 1985 brazil was still doing badly in the transition to democracy congress impeached the first brazilian president elected by the population after the dictatorship due to corruption scandals he also had a controversial plan to reduce inflation where he confiscated savings of the people stored in the bank albeit only larger sums of itbrazil only properly managed to turn around the problem of inflation with the creation of the plano real under fhc the currency changed several times but it was only then that it settled down

4109	1	thats sweet but its not telling the whole storyyes in a direct democracy governments are supposed to be elected by the population to represent them however in a secular state there are certain rights that should be preserved and are none the business of any religious person or group to meddle in if every citizen is equal then they shouldnt get a say on people being able to marry or not because of their sexual orientation thats why many countries legalized samesex marriage through the supreme court or equivalent

4160	1	the game whats that
4161	1	first the regional differences are not as strong as the differences between usa and la so people prefer to go to usa also there is no manual labour shortage like usa people travelling la would probably do the same work as they would do at home so they would rather stay where they arealso travelling is difficult and expensive there are mountainsdeep forests and the roads between nations are in bad shapealso there is a lot of internal immigration thousands of peruvianbolivians come to brasil every year they just dont stay here they work for some months and go back to their families

4167	1	well it is not like latin america has heaps of regions but in that case i would say none
4168	1	im not the person you replied to but ill give it my 2 centsthe thing here in brazil is that we dont segregate much by ancestry but by economic class alone if you ask me what i descent from it is probably europe or south america because im pasty white maybe italia or spain my surname does feel a bit like it but aside from a granddad from bahia the rest is from minas i dont know for sure and most people dont either it is not something we think about since most if not all of the culture we asimilate comes from the economic class we live in and the state as well if i pick for example kids from middle class same state with ancestry of japanese jewish italian and germany they will have most likely ate the same things speak the same language seen the same cartoons had the same toys and heard the same songs i suspect one of my childhood friends is of american ancestry but it is been a few years since i last saw him so i cant askthere are exceptions of course there are some kids that have a dad or mom that is a straight immigrant and brought a lot more of the culture over or maybe a family with strong traditions but the stronger that separation is the rarer it gets as most immigration waves are already past the 2nd generation having a full half or a quarter ancestry is rare the kids go to school get friends with each other and the family quirks of each kid in the same class more or less blend together over time they grow up and marry outside of their ancestry frequently and have kids with a bit of everythingon decendants you have jewish kids learning jiujitsu german kids practicing african religions lebaness kids rapping italian kids reading mahwa we just share everything at the end of the day we are all just braziliansnever heard of africanbrazilians being used anywhere aside from satire

4188	1	youre trying to explain history backwards which is very poor reasoning understanding context back then is key as well as not taking exceptions rare occurrences such as the one you mention as the rule and the numbers themselves show brazilian military regime as very very light compared to any others argentina is for instance not to mention the disgusting allout carnage and crimes from leftist regimes such as cuba and as we speak venezuela

4220	1	i think you misunderstood me you are thinking that i believe argentinachileuruguay are pretty much the same country that is not the case at all what ive been trying to say is that our three countries have a deep conection with each other over certain aspects we are tied by our common history our customs which are very similar but not the same by our food which is also similar but not the same by our landscapes etc  that is what ive been trying to say all along that is why when you said im not saying there are no similarities because there are many and if you compare two countries anywhere in the world it probably doesnt get much closer to this i replied with that is what ive been saying all longle poni color a las longanizas wn xd yo tambien vivi en chillan por unos años y no tienen nada de especial las weas me retracto si tienen algo en especial y es el hecho de que si sigues comiendo esas weas te vas a morir como a los 40of course im taking it seriously i love to fight on the internet half of my comments are fights in fact ive been fighting with the same dude for like a week lol check my comment history
4221	1	yeah it really pisses me off i live in the us and some assholes swear that i came here scaping from the cartels
4222	1	gti learned on this subreddit that is not an appropriate term for me to use and that its disrespectful to colombians and latin americans in general i obviously do not consider myself colombianamerican or latino anymore i just identify as an americanthe latino and the colombianamerican label doesnt matter man  the point that would bother people more than anything would be seeing an american acting like an absolute authority on their ancestor is country issues or worse a whole region that sometimes doesnt has to do much with their ancestor is country it is a thing of being a bit selfaware of that matter i guess that you maybe dont really know in absolute depth of what is going there as an actual colombianvenezuelancuban etc despite having a connection to one or more of these and other latin american nationspeople are not against the culture the latino americans created as you can see on other comments theyre are actually refered as latinos by many people only they specify theyre not latin americans people only make clear it is not the same they only understand theyre an apart cultureas well the whole nationalityamerican thing is totally independent of this whole mess so youre free to do anything on that regard without potentially offending a latin americancelebrating the culture of your ancestors and saying youre colombianamerican wouldnt offend anybody tbh and even if someone is offended why care about that guy is opinion like if he knows anything of you or your family is culture
4223	1	name checks out
4224	1	consider this invert the map of chile and overlay it in a map of europe the far north is like morocco and sahara el norte chico has a climate very similar to southern spain santiago and the central region its more like central france the near south has clima and vegetation like south britain or germany next  southernmost regions comes the ice snow  the fjords  thick forest and really chilly climate pun not intended mimicking the climate for say norway
4225	1	seriously  it is  a really  odd relationship since chileans and brazilians  dont  share borders language  or demographicsis one of those few cases when two random countries like each other
4226	1	1 am youre giving me the point yes we both have something called voseo but chilean and argentinian voseo is quite different especially if you go to most populated areas where most of the countries live besides the specific accent or dialect spoken in mendoza doesnt really represent the majority of the country even more i remind you that were talking about uruguay and argentina you put them all together in the same box chileargentinaurugay2 that is a mistake in argentina is way more common to slow cook the meat and they also cook way more lamb on the other hand chicken has become quite important in chilean asados during the last 30 years due to the incredible rise of poultry consumption also the meat cuts we eat are pretty different for example plateada is one of the most popular cuts 3 i dont wanna be mean but this is not even debatable please go and ask people that have tried both i dont know what you have tried down south but being from chillán  which is famous for its longanizas  i can only assume that youve been eating too many lider or jumbo longanizas 4 do you realise that around 79 of the chilean population live between san felipe and temuco  so sure it is not the majority of the country geographically speaking but is the vast majority in terms of people and you can find huasos in all this area besides the huaso culture has expanded to pretty much the whole country whether you like it or not the culture of santiago and the valle central is by far the most dominant in chile 5 it is hard to believe that two countries have the exact same value system to the point that they share the same political values but im no expert in uruguay ive only been there twice however assuming that you are right which is a long shot what about argentina you are advocating for the common culture of the south cone and you are forgetting the largest culturalpolitical group in the region argentinians have a clear and obvious difference with us regarding political values to such degree that has dramatically impacted the way of living in both nations 6 nope you are exalting the similarities and wilfully forgetting the differences we do have things in common that is undeniable but differences are important they have led our countries in different directions 7 i forgot to mention one of the most important differences the heritage of the mapuches and the other indigenous people genetically speaking we chileans are 5050 between indigenous mostly mapuches and whites this has created a mestizo sense of identity we are mestizos and the mapuche heritage can be seen everywhere on the other hand i couldnt find an updated genetic study regarding argentinians but independently of the result the sense of identity in argentina is way more whiter than in chile they love to feel super white and european all in all this is a massive difference  8 i dont wanna distance chile from anybody im just being realistic we are different we have always been and we will always be however we are geographically where we are therefore we have to engage with our neighbours and they are the most logical business partners we have i wish argentina could put its shit together permanently so we could have some real crossborder investment improve connectivity maybe some pipelines energy etc even more more economic integration would mean better and more opportunities for everybody9 im just pointing out that your comments are romanticising the similarities between the south cone nations and i think you are giving a wrong impression to people on this subreddit regarding the chilean culture  sure you are stating what you feel and that is your own choice nothing to say or do there so let me rephrase based on the arguments that i have previously provided im arguing that despite your personal feelings there are many clear and obvious differences that set all the south cone nations apart ps this really took me too long ahahahah so if the answer is too long i wont answer ps2 also i might be wrong but it seems to me from a few words you used that youre taking this very seriouslyps3 i did have fun though ps4 cheers
4227	1	yeah he is a dumbass

4229	1	read for fucks sake read you really are a brick wall it appears you dont even have the mental capacity to understand this yet again you keep recyling argumentsgtas i said before im complaining about a large video game company with billions of dollars that doesnt do proper research before developing video gamesgtsure what i said are stereotypes but i said them as a way of insulting that company and relieving my anger towards their incompetence my insults were not directed towards americans in general but to the game developers in specific a steretype is defined as a widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing what i did was use this oversimplified image as a way to ridiculize and attack them the game developers and no i do not believe in these steretypes i just used them as a way of comedic relief gtmy argument was about the inacurrate portrayal of my country made by a huge video game company with hundreds of employees whose goal is to create best product posible and as i also stated before i merely used those stereotypes as a way of comedic relief and as a way to creatively insult the game developers instead of using more common insults as i also said before i do not endorse those stereotypes in any way nor do i believe in them which is clearly the difference between me and those guys i used the steretypes as a way of mocking them and as way to rediculize them on the other hand they used those stereotypes in a completely serious manner they 100 believed in themgtendorse is defined as declare one is public approval or support of i have already stated various times that i do not aprove or support these stereotypes the stereotypes were said as a way of comedic relief which i expected to be completlety inferable thanks to the context but apparently that wasnt the case with youthere is nothing wrong with abandoning an argument that youve lost in fact it is very wise to stop im waiting for your next recycled shitty argumentfocus
4230	1	s
4231	1	please enlighten me in which way is it a contradictionso let me see if i understand your idiotic reasoning  i cant ridiculize someone and also use it as comedic relief at the same time is there a rule that tells me that i cant do this look not everyone has the same sence of humor you are the perfect example of that of course i can ridiculize him and use it as comedic relief at the same time you got to that point were youre just cherry picking trying very hard to find some sort of new argument since you know that ive refuted every single one of your shitty older arguments let me tell you it is not working in fact it is only making you look like more of an idiot
4232	1	ive never heard about this stereotype i guess it is kind of true to a small degree but at the same time it isnt it really depends on the socioeconomic status my guess is that this stereotype is based completely around girls from the lower class which have a lot of noticeable indigenous feautures which are often seen as unnatractive by a lot of people me and a lot of other chileans included meanwhile girls from the middle class have little indigenous feautures and girls from the upper class have no indigenous features at all unlike in other countries in chile social classes are super noticiable ethnically speaking people from the lower class have a lot of indigenous features people from the middle class have a few indigenous features and people from the upper class dont have indigenous features at allmy guess is that this stereotype was created thanks to generalization people just assume that all chilean women regardless of the social class look the same in regards of features race hair coloretc that could not be further from the truth one could easily confuse a girl from the lower class and a girl from the upper class as people from completely different countriesin my personal experience and this is just my opinion regarding what is attractive to me or not dont crucify me over it i dont think girls from the lower class are good looking at all sure there are a few good looking girls from the lower class but most of them are not as i said before they have a lot of noticeable indigenous traits and they are a lot shorter i just find all of that really unnatractivegirls from the middle class are kind of a hit or miss for me they can either be really good looking or really average which is not bad at all but very few of them are unnatractiveon the other hand most girls from the upper class are hot as fuck it might be because i have a bias towards blonde girls but i just think that most of them are really good looking

4242	1	nope race is not a biological reality either the thing with determinism is that it determines an outcome with very little or no space for agencyit fails at explaining many many cultural phenomena such as fashion there is no environmental reason for women to wear skirts and men to wear trousers  indeed in some cultures even in similar environments it is men who wear skirts it cant explain the nuances of religion either beyond dietary guidelines which it loves to analyse nor the extreme differences in possibilities of architecture what pray tell is there in the environment that compels people to build pyramidsso it is hard to believe a theory that claims to explain the entirety of human history when it cant account for dozens of basic cultural phenomena nor the possibility of people acting unexpectedly in relation to their surroundings
4243	1	well we were talking about this year so
4244	1	well it can be used like that here but 99 of the time it is assumed to be a rock gesture
4245	1	as i said before im complaining about a large video game company with billions of dollars that doesnt do proper research before developing video gamessure what i said are stereotypes but i said them as a way of insulting that company and relieving my anger towards their incompetence my insults were not directed towards americans in general but to the game developers in specific a steretype is defined as a widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing what i did was use this oversimplified image as a way to ridiculize and attack them the game developers and no i o not believe in these steretypes i just used them as a way of comedic relief
4246	1	gtif a gaucho is the same as a charrúa or as a mapuche gauchos are chilean and argentinean not all chileans are mapuche only around 9 of the population identifies as mapuche and some studies say that only 5 of chileans are mapuchegt they both have very little in common culturally and ethnically probably someone from mendoza does feel close to chile but your argument of culture and ethnicity is weak and also falls down when you try to apply it for chile argentina and uruguay we have a lot in common culturally and ethnically ive also been to buenos aores and santiago btw please feel free to explain to me how my argument falls down
4247	1	you really dont get tired dont you nice trolling btw look ive already explained everything and yet it appears you are not even bothering to read what ive written you keep recycling argument after argument just slightly rephrasing then even tho ive already refuted them you are truly a brick wall thus you are not even worth my time i shall not reply anymore to any of your recycled arguments
4248	1	funny how you ignored everything that just i pointed out and proceeded to throw more arguments since you realized that i refuted the previous ones it appears this is a recurring trend with you after i refute these arguments youll just recycle those that i had refuted earlier and the cicle will continue you just go on and on with the exact same arguments as if im not going to tell that ive already refuted them quit your bullshitgtif youre complaining about game developers writers using latin american stereotypes for comedic purposes lazy or funny accent overly religious poor etc why do you do the same thing for american game developerswow your reading comprehension must be shit im not complaining about game developers using latin american stereotypes for comedic purposes in fact i completely support the idea of using stereotypes for comedic purposes a good example of that are the stereotypes of americans that i used to insult the developers it is unvelibable the fact that after tens of comments and countless explanation you still dont even know what im complaining about im complaining about the stereotypes used in the video game stereotypes which were not used in a comedic purpose at all those stereotypes were to be taken completely seriously socom is not a comedy game by any means socom is not a parody and has never been socom is a shooter with stories that are supposed to be realistic and believable that was not the case at all in regards of the depiction of chile during the gamegtif your argument for using comedy for a stereotype is right then by your logic there is nothing wrong with what these developers writers are doing with latin american stereotypesyou are completely wrong again what a surpriseas i said before my argument was the following my argument was about the inacurrate portrayal of my country made by a huge video game company with hundreds of employees whose goal is to create best product posible and as i also stated before i merely used those stereotypes as a way of comedic relief and as a way to creatively insult the game developers instead of using more common insults as i also said before i do not endorse those stereotypes in any way nor do i believe in them which is clearly the difference between me and those guys i used the steretypes as a way of mocking them and as way to rediculize them on the other hand they used those stereotypes in a completely serious manner they 100 believed in them your reading comprehension is shit i dont give a fuck if they use those stereotypes for comedic purposes they can totally do it as i said before im complaining about the use of stereotypes in a completely serious mannerhere are a couple of useful websites for you make sure to check them out really wellhttpswwwwebmdcombrainmemorylosshttpsblogprepscholarcomhowtoimprovereadingcomprehensionhttpswwwalzorgalzheimersdementia10_signsthere is nothing wrong with abandoning an argument that youve lost in fact it is very wise to stopim waiting for your next recycled shitty argumentfocus quit your bullshit

4250	1	gthow integrated is chile can chileans live and work indefinitely among the core mercosul countries for argentina  and peru you only have to register  your  enter to the country with your passportin theory you have a time limit like a month or two but i am not sure argentina  or peru  really  enforce those lawsgtalso doesnt this result in large influx of migrants overwhelming an economyit does specially  in argentina but for some reason argentina is super open to mass migration might be cultural thing since most of them are recent immigrantsin chile the problem  with mass migration is getting  worse every year but the government  is working  on a way to stop it it probably wont  work thoughgtfor example what prevents someone from paraguay argentina from moving to say brazil in large numbers not many people if any move to brazil the economy  is slow the language barrier plus is the most violent  country  in south america  after venezuela
4251	1	i am pretty sure perú is in the top 3
4252	1	that has absolutely nothing to do with this you just ran out of arguments first of all were talking about a video game not a movie second of all no this game did not have any intent to use comedic relief at all this game is not a parody or a comedy this game is a shooter that is supposed to be taken completely seriously just like all of the other games in the socom seriesgtamerican movies using latin american stereotypes as comedic relief is what got everyone upset in the first placeno not at all what got people upset in the first place is the ignorance by those that create these movies the spreding of misinformation and the completely inacurrate depiction of countries sure some movies use this as a way of comic relief but most dont
4253	1	but its not a race
4254	1	here in chile we call it picardía del chileno chilean mischief for those who dont understand spanish generally we associate it with our humor but there is a social feeling that makes you feel proud for bending the rules in your favor it is there maybe now it is a lot less pronounced in us than what it was some years before for example most of our institutions are really clean and noncorrupt it just does happen a lot in the common life like when you play with friends finding ways to spend less money in things etc
4255	1	this happened after our independence we gained independence in 1810 massive croatian and german immigration began in 1850 there are several reasons as to why here are a few southern chile was a barren inhospitable unpopulated place for our country it was a priority to establish permanent settlements in order to assert our control over the magellan strait and the drake passage lots of cheap land the chilean and argentine governments would pay you if you killed selknam natives they were considered a pest and some croatian immigrants even made a very good living out of killing them the southern tip of chile was the easiest place to access for a european in order to get to chile you had to cross either the magellan strait or the drake passage and in order to get to the main chilean cities in central chile you had to sail all the way north for days weeks in the 1850s chile began a propaganda campaign in europe with the intent of attracting lots of european immigrants in order to settle lands down south this campaign attracted lots of people but mainly germans and croats and to a lesser degree brits who by the way also make up around 5 of chile is population
4256	1	no that would be because we are european jk
4257	1	as a teacher in chile i couldnt agree moreeven the structure in the liceos where the students take all their classes as a group vs changing classes depending on your level in the subject
4258	1	chileans can travel to mercosur countries using our national id card it is not necesary to use a passport you enter as a tourist and maximum stay is tipically 90 days if you want to work or stay as a resident you will have to make other paperwork which is different in every country  so how difficult or easy this is may varyit is far from what exists now in the eu we as a region have a history with volatile leaders so getting everyone to agree to have more integration has been very difficult there is a lot of distrust that countries wont keep their word regarding the agreementscurrently there is also this fear of migrants in chile at least that is polluting and preventing countries to have these kind of discussions
4259	1	well provinces are smaller subdivisions now and each has authorities that work under the regional government each region has at least two provinces
4260	1	but that is fast food

4277	1	gti know you are chilean but chile definitely is not made up mostly by europeansand i have never said that our culture is really similar to argentine and uruguayan culture that is what i said i never talked about us being white but just for the sake of fun let is do some research and look further into itchile is 64 european 30 mestizo and 56 amerindiansource  httpsenmwikipediaorgwikichilegtargentina and uruguay sure are mostly european but there was more european migration to venezuela than to chile for exampleof course there was more european immigration to venezuela they are far larger than chile and they are far closer to europe were literally the southernmost country in the world and we are also located in the pacific ocean that means the only way to get to chile was to cross the magellan strait

4284	1	gtmy point of comparison is relatives who are from santiago though so maybe it is different in your casethat is probably it im from puerto montt santiago is very different to the rest of the country santiago is like a melting pot of nothern central and southern chile santiago is also really multicultural in comparison to other parts of the country
4285	1	if you would only learn the good things like not complaining about stuff that ive already explained instead of learning how to copy and pasting arguments this subreddit would be much better
4286	1	holy fuck dude seriusly you are like arguing with a brick wall have you even read what ive written ill write it again make sure to read it this timegt the stereotypes were said as a way of comedic relief which i expected to be completlety inferable thanks to the context but apparently that wasnt the case with you gt yet again they were said completely as a way to ridiculize and mock the developers the intent was only to make fun of them and their workgt no i did not declared my approval by saying itif youve read everything and still dont understand you either have a mental condition or youve very bad reading comprehension

4288	1	gtyou are ridiculizing a group prejudicehate for comedic relief hurtful while while complaining about someone who is doing what you just did hypocritical oh how horrible of me to have a dark sence of humor and make a joke so hurtful im going to run to a corner to crydude you are an idiot ive answered this same idiotic statement countless times even tho i doubt youve read my answers feel free to go read what i answered before
4289	1	gtmany american movies abuse latin american stereotypes for comedic reliefyes but this what not the case at all this is a completely serious game just like all of the other games in the socom series i know it because ive played most of themgtyou keep doing what youre complaining about it devalues your argumentill keep doing it then i love to devaluate my argument even tho my argument was about the inacurrate portrayal of my country made by a huge video game company with hundreds of employees whose goal is to create best product posible and as i also stated before i merely used those stereotypes as a way of comedic relief and as a way to creatively insult the game developers instead of using more common insults as i also said before i do not endorse those stereotypes in any way nor do i believe in them which is clearly the difference between me and those guys i used the steretypes as a way of mocking them and as way to rediculize them on the other hand they used those stereotypes in a completely serious manner they 100 believed in themplease answer i want to continue to devaluate my argument
4290	1	dude it is the accent or dialect is a major difference every country has its own slang and a particular way of speaking to the point that is extremely easy to identify chileans from argentiniansuruguayans which creates a division methe other  also you point out the voseo but you forget to mention that it is used in a completely different way in both countries asados are somewhat similar i can agree with that however you can also see the differences longaniza chilena is different than the sausages cooked in argentina for example the gaucho thing well you can find people that identify with that in the far south but dude the huaso chileno that you find in the majority of the country is far from that and they would freaking kill you if you called them gauchos i was raised in a farm in chillán so believe me and there are other important differences like respect for the authority and all sorts of values related to the institutions im not saying there are no similarities because there are many and if you compare two countries anywhere in the world it probably doesnt get much closer to this however im only pointing out that where you see similarities many people would see differences that are pretty real so let is not romanticize the old and preposterous idea that were all so similar because it has never lead anywhere
4291	1	yeah surethey arent reliable at all boliviagreatestcountryintheworldcom is by far more reliablein all seriousness the reason why bolivia doesnt appear in those lists is because as of now all of that is speculation if we base everything out of speculation people could just say that the us has the largest reserves or argentinaetc chile will have the world is largest lithium reserves until all of what you said is somehow proven and i dont see that happening in a long time
4292	1	didnt ecuador and peru go to war in the 70s
4293	1	ive seen that a lot of younger peruvians use a lot of chilean slang aswell why is that

4297	1	gtyou sarcastically mock people being offended yet youre the one originally whining and complaining that you got offended over video games and started insulting others you shouldnt be so sensitivei got offended over a video game doing that in a serious manner not in a comedic manner and of course i got offended by it that is not an acurrate representation of my country at allwhere im from we say aweonao perkin culiao no entendi ni una wea so if youre going to be an asshole dont be a an oversensitive wuss when they are an asshole to you you just sound weak
4298	1	i live in arizona i prefer not to say what city mainly for safety reasons there are a lot of weirdos on the internet hope you understand me
4299	1	all countries behave based on their own interest and great powers due to their dominant position in the international system tend to use their material capabilities to get what they want this is a trend in human history and every single great power has behaved in this way at one time or another for example napoleonic france kaiser germany the ussr imperial china before 1700 and so ontaking this into consideration the united states in its 242 years has had a rather benign influence in the world and the region they have not tried to force hegemony and the us has rarely engaged in conquest wars on the other hand after wwii the united states has provided multiple public goods like the free navigation of the seas for example or even the creation of multiple technological advancements that have improved the lives of millions of people im not saying that what they have done in the region is not wrong im only saying that if you analyze their history and the us foreign policy compared to other great powers it becomes clear that the us has been a pretty benign great power great powers are part of the system they are almost like some kind of force of nature whether you like it or not so in one way or another we will have to deal with some of them and to be honest i prefer to deal with the us with its democratic institutions check and balances free press judiciary system that with all its flaws at least provides some resemblance of constitutional government rather than have to face the influence of countries like china ps btw im chilean ive no idea how to show my country in my messages

4358	1	gtbut you are wrong if you think that our products can use chilenian ports freelyyou should stop believing that shitty anti chilean propagandaa bias a bias against people from a country that had two wars with us a country that sued us in the international court of justice a country where most of our illegal immigrants come from a country where most of the drug is smuggled from a country that uses us as an scapegoat a country that spends millions on antichilean propaganda every year a country that threatens our sovereigntyetc wow who wouldve thought color me surprised
4359	1	as i said before im complaining about a large video game company with billions of dollars that doesnt do proper research before developing video gamessure what i said are stereotypes but i said them as a way of insulting that company and relieving my anger towards their incompetence my insults were not directed towards americans in general but to the game developers in specific a steretype is defined as a widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing what i did was use this oversimplified image as a way to ridiculize and attack them the game developers and no i do not believe in these steretypes i just used them as a way of comedic relief
4360	1	gtyou say they are incompetent yet they are making millions of this game you are taking my words out of context i say that they are incompetent because of the fact that a lot people work or supervise the game is story trying for it to be as believable and realistic as possible and yet the story ended up being as inacurrate as possible that is why im calling them incompetent it has nothing to do with the number of sales that the game had which by the way were not good at all of course they are going to make millions the game was made by a aaa video game company although the company that made the game zipper interactive was acquried by sony roughly a year after they made the game so they probably didnt make as much as they expectedgt my point is that youre just like they are everything you say proves that you do the very same things they do and if you were in their position if you were making your own videogame i know you would also abuse stereotypesnot at all we are not alikethey used stereotypes assuming that they were completely correct they used them just as a way to save time and not do research about chile they fully believed that the product that they were delievering was 100 realistic i on the other hand used the stereotypes as a way to mock them as a way to make fun of them as comedic relief that is what you fail to realise you believe that i used those stereotypes in a completely serious manner you believe that i fully agree with those stereotypes and that i have a bias against americans that is not the case at all i study abroad in the us and my girlfriend is american gtalso if i followed stereotypes i would say that chileans are arrogant agressive and disrespectfulthis has nothing to do with our conversation although i would say that that is an acurrate depiction of us

4371	1	that is not correct though here is the text of the pact httpundocsorgesaconf2313httpundocsorgesaconf2313it says  los estados podrán distinguir entre el  estatus  migratorio  regular  e  irregular  incluso  al  decidir  con  qué medidas legislativas  y  normativas  aplicarán  el  pacto  mundialit just looks like a populist attempt to gain the favor of people who are against migration it has been a shock for some groups of people in chile since we were not used to receive as many people as we have in recent years
4372	1	wow first time i see a noniberianamerican posting rasklatinamerica is now complete for me
4373	1	i wouldnt say that argentines are best with accents i met one once that was surprised to know that we also use vos in chile

4377	1	i didnt downvote tho
4378	1	that is interesting i was always taught that only argentina chile and uruguay were part of the southern cone maybe they were just basing it on the economic definitiongt we are much more simila argentina  uruguay than chile basing it on my chilean relatives i guess this really depends on the person and the location the norther you go the less similar it is to argentina uruguay the souther you go the more similar it is to argentinauruguay me for example im from southern chile and everytime ive been to argentina ive felt as if im still in chile i personally feel very close to them culturally but as i said before i guess it depends on the person you ask
4379	1	hahahahah nahhh my friends never say that lol i think they use cagado like estoy cagado for that

4382	1	venezuelans and haitians are latin americans tho
4383	1	gt the accent or dialect is a major differencewe both use voseo theirs developed one way and ours developed a different way thanks to isolationism some people in argentina do have an accent similar to chileans for example people from mendoza we also share a lot of words and slang like for example pituto luca mina etcgtasados are somewhat similarasados are pretty much the samegtlonganiza chilena is different than the sausages cooked in argentina for examplelonganiza chilena is pretty similar to chorizo argentinogtbut dude the huaso chileno that you find in the majority of the country no the huaso chileno can only be found in central chile and northern parts of southern chile that is very far from being the majority of the countrygt like respect for the authority and all sorts of values related to the institutions uruguayans have the exact same respect for authorities and institutions as we dogtim not saying there are no similarities because there are many and if you compare two countries anywhere in the world it probably doesnt get much closer to this this is what ive been saying all alonggtso let is not romanticize the old and preposterous idea that were all so similar because it has never lead anywhere of course it hasnt led anywhere it hasnt led anywhere because people like you want to distance ourselves from them  romanticize  deal with or describe in an idealized or unrealistic fashion make something seem better or more appealing than it really isthis is not idealized nor unrealistic weve both recognized the fact that we have a lot of similarities with them seem better or more appealing i have not done that either ive simply remarked that i feel close to them culturallypreposterous contrary to reason or common sense utterly absurd or ridiculousthis is in no way contrary to common sence absurd or ridiculous why would it be absurd to remark similarities between our countries you stated  im not saying there are no similarities because there are many so does that mean that you believe that this is absurd but at the same time you dont isnt that a contradiction
4384	1	but you are focusing on the socalled murder of 1 person as the downfall of the instituion when in essence it was the cases of corruption and misuse of state funds
4385	1	it is a mix of everything a lot of our words come from mapudungun an indigenous language like for example kiltro which means dog a lot of our words also come from english like for example cachai which comes from the english word catch and means to understand something we also say a lot ya instead of si ive heard some theories say that this comes from german immigrants and the german word for yes ja
4386	1	just curious how do you know this

4487	1	gt  i think that they should since i said on askeurope there is a lot of stuff that europe wouldnt have had if it wasnt for us in the america is introducing it to themwhy is it you always mention this but you never mention the things the americas wouldnt have if it wasnt for europe how is this relevant anywayand i think you introducing it to them is rather biased they did have to traverse a whole ocean for you to introduce it to them youre incredibly partial on this topic and willfully ignore a lot of things just to drive home who knows which point which i still think is rather irrelevant in this particular conversation in fact in reality shouldnt you be thankful to the early spanish colonists for introducing you cuba to the tomato and the potato which need i remind you are south american plants and werent present in cuba until the spanish brought them over
4488	1	that is what im talking about
4489	1	just listened to the artists you named thanks for the input they were great

4497	1	gtat least in argentina i know 0 people with last name composed as fathermotheryeah i was precisely thinking of argentina when i said i didnt want to assume it was common everywhere because of the noniberian european influencesare composite first names common thoughgt most cases of double last names are not shared between mother and father but are the 2 last names of the fatherive never seen that gt maybe this is a bit more common in peru colombia ecuador in the south of the cone as far as i know it is almost nonexistenti found this wikipedia article on the topic httpsenwikipediaorgwikinaming_customs_of_hispanic_america but it is incomplete
4498	1	hmmmid say 20 it is hard to say though
4499	1	not really scotland and finland are two european countries who are very proud of their military but neither of them lived under a dictatorship
4500	1	i personally think northern mexicans have way more in common with anglo is than chileans and especially argentines they helped influence a lot of redneck and cowboy culture in the usa especially in texas ive been to texas and have seen just as many mexicans wearing cowboy hats and boots as anglos some speak with a southern accent too also baseball is a popular sport in northern mexico as wellthere seems to be a notion that being more highly developed makes one have more in common with anglo is but that is a misconception argentines have 50 times more in common with italians than anglo is ditto for uruguayans
4501	1	yeahmany do though it is usually reduced to small phrases or words popularized from old songs
4502	1	he probably meant the meaning of liberal that is a synonym to progressive
4503	1	happens in cuba all the time i know people that come expecting it to be an impoverished communist shithole who were stunned by the architecture and how safe it was
4504	1	yup my family dealt with some crap down in miami which is why they stayed in the northeast
4505	1	hey as a cuban i always considered pr is to be our hermanitos
4506	1	is that sub like some sort of red pill nice guy or incel sub
4507	1	probably due to timing and the scale of immigration haitians in cuba for instance mostly immigrated in the 19th century and early 1900 is which gave them way more time to assimilate immigration slowed down after that periodthe dr is haitian immigrant population boomed in the 1990 is and 2000 is haitians have always had a presence in the dr but according to the dr census in 1950 only a few thousands of people were of haitian origin
4508	1	machismo is one of the worst things that spain implemented when they invaded our island in 1492
4509	1	really im from the western side of the island and ive never seen a black cuban being treated as an outsider i never lived in the eastern side of the island but maybe whiter cubans would be treated as outsiders there and how are we still recovering from racial segregation racism and prejudices exists in cuba like everywhere else sadly but i didnt think we were an extreme its like the problem with gender inequality that exists pretty much everywhere does a black cuban man or a white cuban woman have better opportunities
4510	1	completely off topic here but i just saw your flair and its awesome
4511	1	all the venezuelans on this sub seem to want an army to come invade the country and massacre all the supporters of maduro it is very hard to read sometimes
4512	1	how do dr is typically view cubans
4513	1	wow i am so sorry  it must be hard losing a close friend of yours like that to a cult  i think we have talked on here before and as you know i identify as taino and when i do that i often times get evangelicals and spanishelitists belittle me where it really just terrifies me in how they can just stand still and belittle people if anyone else were to do that where they just stood in the middle of a park and started shouting at people people would be deeply disturbed
4514	1	ive heard stories from relatives whove spent extended time in pinar del rio and surrounding areas who had certain assumptions made about them it was nothing extreme but definitely noticeable maybe things are changing there though eastern cuba has a good islenocanarian populationmy grandmother was one and theyre not really treated differently at all it is all relative but i feel post revolution cuba isnt really that much more integrated than before it is just more subtle and unspoken i remember going to rich clubs in havana with some of my cousinswho are nonwhite and you would literally think you were in clubs in buenos aires or montevideo i even have pics on my phone to prove it meanwhile in the slums most people looked like uslike i said it is all relative though as i believe there is more of a divide in sayecuador than cuba but i feel there is still a divide
4515	1	your relatives that spent time in pinar del río probably had assumptions made about them because their mannerism would suggest they are not pinareños but i highly doubt it was solely based on their race majority of the wealthier people are white because they are descendants of some rich spanish person although a lot of these cubans left cuba after the revolution but they still send money to their remaining relatives on the island that are probably white too while black cubans are less likely to have wealthier family abroad i definitely agree with you that overall theres a racial divide mentality that has stayed with our society since the colonial era hopefully that will change one day
4516	1	yeah manyou should go to camaguey there is a lot of cubans of haitian descent there some other parts of the eastern side do tooampx200b
4517	1	how do you feel about pr achieving statehood
4518	1	thank you yes great point in the uk the head of the labour party jeremy corbyn suggested that children learn more about their colonial past and to be honest with you i think that they should since i said on askeurope there is a lot of stuff that europe wouldnt have had if it wasnt for us in the america is introducing it to them such as tobacco tomatoes and potatoes and to be honest it really also gets me mad how in south america and the caribbean we have hispanic elitists who want to boast about how european they are but when someone wants to say how africanindigenous they are they get told to get over it and that there cultures werent even that great
4519	1	gt curious as to how it could be dying it is a legal name do some people just not write down part of their own last namei got the question because of movie credits showing one name and one surnames instead of two i guess they can just use one for the movie credits and two for official documents it just seemed like a strange thing to me though probably it is been going on for a while and it is just now that i noticed youd think that artists of all people would want their names to be more unique so that their work couldnt be confused with that of another person but i guess the two particle format just rolls off the tongue more easily
4520	1	exactly i couldnt agree more where if we were in contact with our native roots we wouldnt have as many problems we wouldnt have to deal with the toxicity that spain brought over when they invaded us where we would actually know our roots and not constantly worship an entity that invaded us i personally am a part of the united confederation of taino peoples and since joining them i have felt such a stronger sense of purpose do to how i am getting reintroduced to our foods culture customs traditions spirituality and just so much more
4521	1	japanese society tends to be that way where a lot of the time they tend not to talk about problems often out of fear of losing face causing it where they just hide a lot of their problems and dont talk to anyone about them to be honest this is why i really like south koreans southern and south eastern asians because of how while they do follow the same philosophy of saving face they are more open with you about problems where my best friend for example is korean and he tends to save face in public where if something goes wrong he will just smile and accept it but later he will tell me woah man that place was scary i am glad we just got a water and left compared to with my childhood japanese friend who would be visibly freaked out by how scary the place is but when i ask him if he would like to leave he says no and toughs it out even afterwords i will ask him how it was and he will be like oh the place was alright i thought there food was decent
4522	1	true but upper class cubans tend to have very close ties to spain
4523	1	i have a peruvian friend and she likes to be called by her two names all the time rather than just one
4524	1	im cuban too and i got a dna test for the same reason  i was actually really surprised to find out i had native american were you
4525	1	gt i always mention this do to the fact that a lot of textbooks always talk about how in the america is if it wasnt for the europeans then we in the america is wouldnt have had certain things such as steal where it really creates this bias in favor of europe as if europe was this savior for us in the america is when they were exactly what they called themselves conquerorsany kind of bias to any side is detrimental to education and knowing the truth it is like battling racism against black people by saying black people are superior to all the other peoplethe europeans also introduced many kinds of plants and crops to the americas  the america is  is a possessive like oranges lemons apples bananas mangos onions coffee wheat rice etc it was an exchange i realize youre trying to battle the bias of one side by showing the other side is but to people who havent been exposed to the first kind of bias like me your bias is pretty evident and not any different from the bias youre trying to fight theyre both only showing one side and getting in the way of seeing the whole picture like it was without subjective judgement and im not disagreeing with you to say that colonization was good or that all of the stuff that happened was worth it because of the things europeans introduced to the americas im not trying to defend or justify any of the awful things europeans did im just trying to point out the biasgt while you are right about them introducing those to crops to us you dont realize that in precolumbian times we had trade with the mayan and modern day florida also these foods were revolutionary for europeans in many waysno i do realize that but that doesnt change what i said i just think it is weird to say we gave them tomatoes when cuba had pretty much nothing to do with the discovery and domestication of said vegetables it would be like an estonian saying we europeans colonized indochina it wasnt so much the europeans as it was the french
4526	1	how do colombians feel about cubans apparently a distant relative of mine got deported from colombia and this is a common thing he was one of those migrants on the boatslol

4531	1	it is hard to explain but cuba assimilated its haitian and jamaican populations really fast compared to other latin american countries theyre just considered cubans or afrocubans at this point cuban son music was started by early haitian workers and it was embraced by all cubans for instance
4532	1	fuck is sake youre annoying
4533	1	can you go into more detail about them and why you put friend in quotation marks to be honest evangelicals terrify me where they turn a blind eye to history where i confronted one once about how he was a hypocrite to go around hating on muslims when it was his people who forced there beliefs on indigenous people at the threat of dismemberment causing him to just not respond and start blaming muslims
4534	1	hahai cant really blame you though too much pretension on social media these days
4535	1	gt a responsibility to its former colonies and they do attempt to address itcan you tell me more about this part please
4536	1	i figured it sounds like she was just trying to make your country look badlol
4537	1	what are the islands other than easter island
4538	1	by the way that cartoon reminds me of how i found thishttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5lafrpdailq when i was trying to find out more about what it meant to be taino lls
4539	1	in cuba people make fun of spaniards all the time     españa españa los españoles no se bañan and mocking the ceceobut gallego and españolito are terms ive heard used as terms of endearment so it is a mixed bag ive never heard any praise for spain though
4540	1	very true u8thalt you are the first person to tell me about how there are cubans who make fun of spaniards where a lot of the cubanamericans i have met really just polish spains boot where if i say i want to go anywhere in europe but spain people think i am weird
4541	1	exactly my experience that is why i take tons of photosvideos when im down there
4542	1	oh wow well maybe the text books were updated then because sometimes that is what happens where textbooks in schools can be very biased where they favor one side over the other
4543	1	i only asked because i often see people blaming past colonial powers for their current hardships and while in the beginning most people were saying spain had no blame the top answer ended up being that it was to blame so the community is divided on this topic and it is not a onesided echo chamber
4544	1	gt i would start walking towards the nearest borderactually from what ive read colombia is being much more accepting and helpful to venezuelans than brazil is
4545	1	is salsa commonly played too
4546	1	no i live in nyc but most of my family lives in cuba i travel to cuba very often and know my way around different cities there
4547	1	oh okay i get what youre saying
4548	1	ive heard some cubans accuse pr is are taking salsa from us but it is usually said in jest
4549	1	same ive been using instagram more as of lately
4550	1	the point is you say you cant pay and they say that is okay we dont need your money but were gonna be using this airportseaportmineroadbridgeetc for the next 100 years to cover the debtthat is how they get ya ask sri lanka
4551	1	kind of cuba was even basically considered another canary island during the time when it was still a spanish colony my grandmother is canarian and there is a lot of canarian influence in the accent and part of the culture
4552	1	he is a president we didnt become a monarchy now did we
4553	1	why is it you always mention this but you never mention the things the americas wouldnt have if it wasnt for europe how is this relevant anyway    i always mention this do to the fact that a lot of textbooks always talk about how in the america is if it wasnt for the europeans then we in the america is wouldnt have had certain things such as steal where it really creates this bias in favor of europe as if europe was this savior for us in the america is when they were exactly what they called themselves conquerors    in fact in reality shouldnt you be thankful to the early spanish colonists for introducing you cuba to the tomato and the potato which need i remind you are south american plants and werent present in cuba until the spanish brought them over   while you are right about them introducing those to crops to us you dont realize that in precolumbian times we had trade with the mayan and modern day florida also these foods were revolutionary for europeans in many ways ampx200b
4554	1	gt but a couple years ago it was made mandatory to have both surnames in the id mothers required  fathers if knownhmmm that is interesting any reason given for that
4555	1	oh yeah definitely i couldnt agree more i find that a lot of cubans who live outside of miami tend to really look down on the elitism and tribalism that is so rampant there where i live on the east coast outside of florida and while i havent met many cubans a lot of the ones i have met tend to be very down to earth and genuine where when they hear about miami cubans they roll their eyes
4556	1	cuban americans understanding by that term americans with cuban ancestry or cubans raised in the us arent the same as cubans born and raised in cubapeople in cuba have been since the 70s growing up with elpidio valdés which is a cuban rebel fighting spain for the independence of cuba and in school everyone is taught about how bad spain was and how we needed independence from them so culturally if anything people are taught to dislike spain or at least resent them for the colonial past it is really not uncommon to make fun of spain and spaniards and again ive never heard anything that could be considered praise
4557	1	yup and haitian kreyol is the 2nd most spoken language in cuba after spanish
4558	1	im one of the few cubans that has never lived in miami or florida although i did land in the miami airport when i flew in from cuba i live in the midwest so im one of the very few cubans around i visit cuba every year to see my family so i havent been too homesick
4559	1	ok this is just a rumor i heard but is it true that uruguayans who are mixed with black are often called brazilians as an insult a chilean friend of mines told me that but that is the 1st time i ever heard that
4560	1	what about the people of latin american descent in the united states that adopt a la identity because theyve been alienated by american white protestant dominated media and thus turn to their ancestors culture seeking a community to belong to without actually having had much contact with it
4561	1	very soon our economy will overtake puerto rico is we dont need sports you can have it
4562	1	fair enough is that considering one is renting an apartment this is besides the point but what do you think is the average and median income in dr and then more specifically in distrito nacional
4563	1	colombians tbh ive never seen them as being caribbean
4564	1	how so the us has destabilized nations before
4565	1	dominicans is super hard to follow i could argue their spanish is worse than oursit is lol
4566	1	there is an actual live action film being made with isabela moner as the lead tho httpsenmwikipediaorgwikidora_the_explorer_film
4567	1	this once you leave the cities youre basically in the middle of bumfuck nowhere with no reliable electricity or water shit
4568	1	yes but it is a higher percentage in chile

4570	1	gt straight up deny any black roots they might have even if they hair is coily as fuck bullshitnever seen anyone that does thatampx200b
4571	1	yes not kidding and it is not something that i chose which i think is good so that people dont classify themselves things they are not they use skin color instead of race for the biometrics of the driver is licence so you can be a jabao and in the skin color section of the driver is license itll list whitealso the reason it is skin color and not race is because pretty much everyone is mixed and there are no distinctions of race overall
4572	1	what the fuckwe cant even have a male santa anymore why cant she be mrs claus for the parade i hope this type of stuff dont come over to latam
4573	1	yeah man i totally see itcubans mexicans and bolivians all look the same  fuck outta here
4574	1	httpswwwfocuseconomicscomcountrieshaiti
4575	1	gtdominicans is super hard to follow i could argue their spanish is worse than oursnaah it is not that bad
4576	1	werent they recovering from a civil war and in a dictatorshipshortly after their economy boomedpretty much all of europe had less gdp per capita than venezuela in the 50 is
4577	1	id say very positively because theyre similar to us culturally ethnically etc in my family we have cuban relatives and familyfriends personally i like cuba and cubans even though i dont like communism our cultural similarities supersede that our government needs to reach out to cuba more and take the leadership initiative to coax cuba into becoming more economically liberal so we can both benefit from trade and commerce with each other but the dr government isnt into leadership
4578	1	things like i mentioned do happen in pr tho and some people here do claim to be directly descented exclusively from white europeans it is just that for some people it is more plausible to deny blackness by claiming taino ancestry and for others it makes more sense to deny any of their mixed ancestry directly it depends on the family i guess lolnow being honest with you i genuinely renounce the idea of like blood tests really defining anything regarding race or really disclosing anything too meaningful regarding ancestry itd be fun to get one just to like see but like specially in the case of latin americans having some amount of x or y ancestry up your family tree wont really define your race on practice most white latin americans have some indigenous or african ancestry it is just most of their ancestry is white or is the most visible one same with every other group in the region really
4579	1	only you sure it was only us that didnt sign that pact
4580	1	well mexico is not the name of a continent
4581	1	sanky pankyshttpsenwikipediaorgwikisankypanky theyre basically men who accept money or some other kind of reward for being with tourist women often taking the role of a sugar baby or a lover for the time theyre here gtalso how is this looked on in dominican society to see grown adults with childrenit is mostly seen negatively but many people are just dismissive of these children and willfully ignore what is happening ive even heard people say they somehow deserve that kind of horrible experiences  before sometimes their parents are sex workers themselves which makes it even harder for them to control what is happening and other people just dont really pay attention to them eitherhowever as mentioned before it is not as common for tourist to go outside of the touristy areas and in fact grown dominican men being in relationships with girls much younger than them may be an equally worrying problem that is much less publicized imogt are these people from such poor areas that this is the only way the can afford to livethat is the case a lot of the time here sex work is legal but not regulated making it a risky situation to get involved in and making it hard if not impossible to organize and mobilize to raise awareness to these issues and promote the rights for people who participate in this  and just knowing how bad our justice system is getting justice for someone who doesnt have the funds to actually make a big deal of their case is currently a lost cause from my point of view
4582	1	gtis that considering one is renting an apartmentactually yes exactly i was looking at that the other day and i came to the conclusion that depending on the place you rent with 30k you could live comfortablygtwhat do you think is the average and median income in dr and then more specifically in distrito nacionalhonestly that is something im not sure i could answer because there is so many variables to take into account like for example on the average there is quite a few people who have monthly salaries that go way beyond what one would consider normal like politicians and this would skew that a bit i can say off the top of my head counting only people around me it is probably like a rd 15000 to 20000 average though
4583	1	good point i noticed this type of political correctness is common in argentina but also in chile too i guess when youre developed you start to worry about dumb stuff
4584	1	they really dont unless youre blind cubans and bolivians look way differenti can understand if you think cubans and dominicans look the same becuase we both have a lot of mulattos but cubans and bolivians lol
4585	1	the pacific alliance is just a trade bloc with the purpose of trade liberalization mercosur is something else it is a political union and very protectionist and that is what is going to prevent the pacific alliance from failing the thing is that there is not a lot of will power for  joint political unions countries want their sovereignty but when it comes to economic development it is a different story political unions make things more complicated economic ones make things simpler
4586	1	same in dr
4587	1	the old green card trick you might want to ask the nigerians and moroccans how to execute that one lol
4588	1	100 right someone working in mcdonald is in ny is making way more money than someone working in mcdonald is in dr but they are both living in pretty much the same circumstances slightly better in ny though but still pretty much the same circumstances
4589	1	that is meaningless go to australia and ask them what contient they are in they wont say australia ask new zealanders as well your condescending comment doesnt prove anything if anything it proves that you know you are wrongampx200b
4590	1	but that doesnt mean all of colombia is carribbean or largely caribbean influenced
4591	1	i meant out of latin america i know that chile and dr were not the only ones in the world
4592	1	in the us when the media uses the word latino they mostly refer to mexicans who make up the majority of the latino population go to any hispanic heritage event and its pretty much all about mexicans and their social issues its kind of annoying tbh
4593	1	i hate that it happens in dr too if people are not living in improvised villages right off the river with improvised houses made out of scrap metal and scrap wood then those people are not the real dominicans if someone is not black or dark skin then he is not a real dominican if someone lives in an average decent house or apartment then he is not a real dominican drives me nutssome one literally told me i went to the campo to experience the real culture lol
4594	1	te estás refiriendo al idioma latín pero el adjetivo latino en inglés es latin
4595	1	i heard they cheat a lot tho
4596	1	again i said it was bad im not defending itgt anyway how is the venezuelan population affected by sanctions against a handful of individuals who are top government officials because i was not referring to sanctions on officials i was referring to the economic sanctions gt you should know that the vast majority of the venezuelan population rejects maduro we all know that you thought i didnt knowim not defending maduro just in case that is what you thinkampx200b
4597	1	no i think it is a good thing but i think there is a reason it was only chile and dr
4598	1	like i said i dont know what indio means i was just describing myself to attempt to give an idea but there are darker people than me and lighter people than me that are also classified as indio it is super ambiguous there are also white people that are classified as mestizo and black people that are classified as mulato or even indio lol it makes no sense
4599	1	that is ridiculous and i say it in a good way
4600	1	gtcan people from outside the caribbean tell that easilysome people can it varies it really should be easy and the differences are really obvious to me but like i cannot say it is the same for everyonegtwould a spanish speaker immediately recognize a foreigner as soon as they started talkingyes at least here the answer is a rotund yes we notice inmediately here we dont ask first time on a conversation if at all but yes we all notice very easilygtyou can usually tell the region if you heard someone from for example el salvador talking would you aha salvadorian or aha central americanwed notice general region normally but there is some that are just very clear like the ones i mentioned on the original comment
4601	1	that is true i agree but that is not what i meant you know what i meant
4602	1	honduran delicacy i presume
4603	1	because that is what you mostly look like and i think dominicans would acknowledge both the same
4604	1	gtthe natives didnt have gender roles they were imposed by the colonizersuh not to be nitpicky but like there is records that the way gender worked in the very least some indigenous american groups was different from the way that it works in europe and the enforcement of european gender roles was part of the assimilation and colonization process that took place after initial contact
4605	1	no it doesnt and again there is no continent called peru there is no continent called norway there is no continent called micronesia and there is no continent called china when people say columbus discovered america they dont mean he discovered the us you know that
4606	1	is it only certain sectors of the population that are not in favor of illegal immigrationyes i agree the pld tries to present themselves as hard on illegal immigration but they dont really do it and sometimes they use immigration to divert attention from other more important issues and that is why i think people criticize them
4607	1	gtis it only certain sectors of the population that are not in favor of illegal immigrationthat is not what i said though i said certain sectors of the population are against immigrant populations in general
4608	1	yeah in latin america are you sure it was only us 2
4609	1	but the name of the country is united states of america not united states of north america the name implies that there is one continent called america
4610	1	isnt latino just latin in spanish
4611	1	i dont understand the question i would know both are mixed
4612	1	hmm i have had to dodge the dominican cheater typecast as well still havent heard the women cheater thing though
4613	1	really goldiggers yes cheaters never heard that one
4614	1	sorry man i didnt mean to say all i made a post weeks ago about cost of living and some guy from argentina said something about foreign bank accounts that is why i thought some people had it my comment wasnt meant to be negative towards argentina at all or anything like that
4615	1	not so much in my personal experience but it is not like thatd be rare or anything i think my family just isnt that much into salsa lol
4616	1	i second this chilean economics 1 thing to implement
4617	1	not true right here we use the point
4618	1	yeah the video talks about bartolomé de las casas he spoke against the mistreatment of the taínos and proposed to use africans as slaves instead lol the video is mainly about all these negative things we constantly hear about columbus are not true some were completely fabricated and others were taken out of context all the deaths were attributed to columbus when in fact almost all the deaths were caused by diseases columbus was harsh even to the spanish living in the island it mentions a lot of details that are worth taking into account
4619	1	other dominicans are involved too and many dont respect the age of consent
4620	1	the coastal part of colombia is definitely caribbean influenced however as you go inward the andean influence starts to become more apparent akin to ecuador and peru venezuela is more caribbean becuase they have little to no andean region so that culture has never really taken hold
4621	1	dont worry the only way to shut them up is to keep going forward with our fast economic growth
4622	1	holy shit that is expensive
4623	1	i dont really know what to make of poverty rate statistics because in the us the poverty rate is really low at 123 but the poverty line is like 12k a year federal minimum wage in the us gets you 13k a year so to be considered poor you have to make less than minimum wage a year that is ridiculous someone that makes minimum wage is not considered poor i dont really trust poverty rate statistics i rather go by cost of living and median income
4624	1	yeah that is it thanks
4625	1	if you pay them enough yes theyll turn a blind eye that is why i said we need a better police force but some idiots like the canadian guy i mentioned do it on broad daylight and there is no way the police will turn a blind eye to that santiago has its own municipal police which in my opinion performs way better than the national police all other municipalities rely on the national police for their security and the national police sucks ass so we either need a new reformed national police or all municipalities need to stop relying on the national police are establish their municipal police
4626	1	first puertorican i see in this sub
4627	1	what no way
4628	1	idk as far as i know many not all haitians in chile sell ice cream in the streets just like they do in dr maybe selling ice cream is a very lucrative business in chilechile is richer the us is way richer dr is way behind chilealso not even dominicans do well in dr
4629	1	like i would know the answer to that question that depends on the person behind the counter at the office you go to get your licence
4630	1	there is a china town in santo domingo indeed iirc however the jewish community on sosua didnt really thrive even if they were invited there and most moved elsewhere afterwards punta cana is indeed home to a lot of russians and other europeansadditional to those 3 samaná is full of retired anglos both us american and canadians  go there a lot to retire and well as expected there is a lot of enclaves with a mostly haitian population all throughout the territory but in santo domingo there is also a place called literally little haiti
4631	1	cuba is the closest location to haiti after dr and jamaica why would it be surprising
4632	1	yeah even brazil signed it but theyre backing out from it in january
4633	1	so that makes it ok to ask 600 million people below the us to change the way they call themselves
4634	1	fair enough
4635	1	gt the arepa is a precolumbian dish from the area that is now colombia and venezuelain the origins sections it literally says it is from colombia and venezuela
4636	1	gt that is a large reason of why they have suffered their crisis i would sayno they suffered their crisis because their economy depended too much on oil they never diversified
4637	1	yeah pretty much a trade bloc with a single currency
4638	1	really i still see a lot of puertoricans making really negative comments in youtube videos about dr maybe the comments are old
4639	1	i dont see how theyre in an island after all it is not like theyre all over venezuelait is just maduro crying for help and willing to do anything for a few extra pennies putin in my opinion is just taking advantage of the weakness to gain some strategic upper hand if you will which is bad but do you know what else is bad if not worse putting sanctions on venezuela because at the end of the day sanctions only affect the people and makes them suffer
4640	1	gt there arent economic sanctions httpswwwlatimescompoliticswashingtonlanaessentialwashingtonupdatesuseconomicsanctionsvenezuela1503676692htmlstoryhtmlhttpswwwlatimescompoliticswashingtonlanaessentialwashingtonupdatesuseconomicsanctionsvenezuela1503676692htmlstoryhtmlhttpswwwnprorgsectionsthetwoway20180522613250814presidenttrumpapprovesnewsanctionsonvenezuelahttpswwwnprorgsectionsthetwoway20180522613250814presidenttrumpapprovesnewsanctionsonvenezuelagt youre just spewing the same bullshit he does but of course youre not supporting him no im not i never said it is someone else is fault that the country is in crisis even though i never said it youre still somehow attributing that idea to me the country wouldve still been shit even without the sanctions we all know that ffs but that is besides the pointyoure trying to be sarcastic and cool and all but i really dont support him lolampx200b
4641	1	because i can clearly see that you look black even though youre mulatto for someone that is racially ambiguous it is hard to tell what race or what combination of races they are
4642	1	both are mulatto so i guess yes
4643	1	the corrupt government is hoarding all that growth too
4644	1	so just to make sure i understand dialects are the same language and are mutually intelligiblei always thought dialects werent mutually intelligible
4645	1	with the ridiculous taxes
4646	1	yeah they didnt really think it through because indio is not really a color it is more of a racethe other colors are negro mestizo mulato and blanco mestizo and mulato are not colors either lol
4647	1	it has heads of state and they had plans of implementing a parliament for it that is enough for me to consider it a political union
4648	1	i think he means something more like what gran colombia was or like the federal republic of central america
4649	1	it is not the rest of the world lol you know it
4650	1	this also the us wants us to be fragmented and have infighting because it secures the us position as the dominant force in the western hemisphere
4651	1	true but those are things i really like
4652	1	thanks for the heads up
4653	1	lol honestly i have no idea because ive been confused with portuguese and even italian in the states so i guess indio would be like looking tanned think of the darker skinned portuguese and italians that should give you an idea of what indio isin dr that is not racist at all im amazed that you find it racist and that other argentines in this thread find it offensive
4654	1	i think you mean slang
4655	1	what
4656	1	same here
4657	1	sung by a brit
4658	1	i know it is just ironic that a british band has a song about what their country did to other people i love iron maiden btw and love the song
4659	1	can confirm
4660	1	aweonao washos qliaos
4661	1	what ive heard is we were good at fighting but not good at intl relations so we get screwed in the deals
4662	1	i mean you are kind of a cultural union but not the same culture if that makes any sense anybody but the most ignorant will recognize the differences between anglos and each anglo has its own stereotypes canadians are nice australians are tough british are posh we latinos are all mexican under gringo eyes like some seem unable to grasp that puerto rican  mexican and thus they assign the same stereotypes to us
4663	1	ok man btw joey belladonna is part iroquois so there is kind of a reason
4664	1	at this rate not for long
4665	1	i think thats part of the problem even the influence of their most outdated social institutions like racial and socioeconomic virtual caste systems are still evident in latin america today
4666	1	osthia tio
4667	1	we are similar we share a lot we are all brothers but we are not the same our countries are different and unique not interchangeable some gringos seem to think we are exactly the same and we are not
4668	1	yeah lad its pretty selfexplanatory in guatemala both terms are used interchangeably
4669	1	not really a dish just a tortilla with a longanizaputting junk on a tortilla is such a natural everyday thing that we dont really call it anything
4670	1	ikr
4671	1	ah there is your answer the highlands have a higher mayan population among mestizos it is scarcely used but mayans probably use it more i wouldnt know
4672	1	trump is not putin is bitch hillary and the entire clinton foundation along with the deep state were putin is bitch look at the 140 million they gave to them look at the uranium ore deals lol deluded
4673	1	i live in guatemala the police would laugh if you called to report a noise violation when someone wants to blast music at a party they can go all night as long as they want very frustrating
4674	1	shame on you avergüenzas a la nación
4675	1	yet you are all so skinny
4676	1	its weird to me that only colombia and central america seems to call them bananos do you know what venezuelans and ecuadorians call them
4677	1	i was being cheeky but thanks for the info
4678	1	sad aint it
4679	1	cool how did you end up in our dear highlands if you dont mind
4680	1	just people in the caribbean in general it is a generalization though i dont know or think it is widespread but ive heard the sentiment
4681	1	is the whole cuban women sell their bodies for some lipstick since they cant buy any at all true or pure bs
4682	1	mexico is is at around half or so i read last time guatemala is just south of it is at 75
4683	1	ironically some black people in the caribbean try to emphasize their native heritage sometimes even if it is imagined as a way of rejecting their black roots
4684	1	its obvious all claims of the spanish empire were inherited by the states which succeeded itin any case im memeing i dont actually mean to seriously downplay the guatemalan atlantic departm errr belizes autonomy
4685	1	gtteacher in chilepretty brave
4686	1	wtf is nazil
4687	1	the reason i made this post was that growing up i assumed that all latin countries ate carne asada in some form or another as it is so common in guatemala and we dont really produce that much beef as a society yet a peruvian friend once told me that carne asada was always foreign to her and that peru didnt have it is own typical version while im very familiar with argentineuruguayan churrasco many lowtier argentineuruguayan football players go to guatemala and establish restaurants after retiring would you mind posting a picture of what it looks like as well as some sides you would tyipically eat with it
4688	1	haha who the fuck are you anyway thats just two out of three
4689	1	specifically evangelicals it is alarming how much of an effect those people have on a country
4690	1	which part of latam is uncivilized
4691	1	we use calcium on the nixtamal which makes them both thicker and denser
4692	1	oh damn i thought americans couldnt travel to cuba anymorethe midwest cheese curds snow and alcoholism good times
4693	1	bruh all of central america sees you as a rivalyoure a regional hegemon with a stronger economy historical political dominance over our countries and of coursefootballmexicos indifference and downplaying of our relationship makes us hate you more
4694	1	yes a mexican song from the 2000s is the origin of the word gringo
4695	1	hay mara que se ofende
4696	1	as a guatemalan trying to move away from central america im looking forward for your answer
4697	1	vos has de estar entre ellos
4698	1	i think we are all supposed to use the comma but us influence makes us use the period
4699	1	gracias por la tautología
4700	1	how fucking surprising youd take such an ignorant stance
4701	1	i feel like if you adopt the culture of your new country it is sensible to consider you part of their country and not the one youve decided to depart from
4702	1	and guatemala maybe is a regional thing in central america and the caribbean
4703	1	why cant you just rent them some coastline though
4704	1	httpsenmwikipediaorgwikibelizeanguatemalan_territorial_disputewhen argentia invaded the falklands a full 75 of the guatemalan army was called to the border with belice
4705	1	maybe costa rica or cuba
4706	1	sí a huevos
4707	1	i hear you to be honest though i was very impressed with montevideo love that city
4708	1	you dont have to like my stances dude i have opinions for myself not for anybody else i live for myself and my familycall my stances ignorant all you want it doesnt make me or you neither right nor wrong
4709	1	in guate cuban women are considered really attractivecuban men are considered really loud
4710	1	i agree with you of course in honduras your anglocaribbean area is highly touristed as you mentioned which means its probably a more wellknown on a national scale but that is not the case in guatemala the culture in livingston is completely different than the rest of the country it is called garifuna many people in latin america are unaware that guatemala has a region with an englishspeaking dialect but it is very similar to the bay islands culture in honduras belize and the caribbean coast of costa ricato be honest i really enjoy the fact that latin america is so diverse and multicultural guatemala is garifuna culture is an important part of this nation is and the region is diversity i think most people here feel the same way
4711	1	what do you mean they try to be something they are not you cant think in absolutes like that its nonsense am i no longer latino because i moved away and why do you get to define what other people are if i didnt know any better i would say it sounds like jealousy and resentment towards people that were able to move away for better opportunities in life
4712	1	yeah for some reason they do that
4713	1	majority of my family are either peasant or teacher working in remote area so i been through many places however i havent step foot in olancho gracias a dios el paraíso nor colón so far
4714	1	not really we pretty much have many real cases of fraud happened during the elections oas even admitted the election was a fraud there was studies of how joh flip was mathematic impossible after nasralla had a major lead they close down voting counting for a week and suddenly joh won there was also many cases of where they found boxes of preselected joh plus joh put his people to the supreme court where he could run the election again when the constitution said no one can run again even the head of tse was joh is friend the us only care about keeping their interests happy
4715	1	to put it into perspective 1 in 5  hondurans live on less than 190 usd per day 700 usd per year
4716	1	i dont share the same viewpoint either way 23 industry in honduras are maintained by us investors yet 110 hondurans lived outside of the country and exodus are only growing either way these us companies are exploiting our wealth no nation have any rights to interfere other nations even with good intentions
4717	1	yes plenty of them cheated on their man but the men are even worse they have to have more than a wife
4718	1	crimen pasional cegado de amor se volvió cegado de celossome catchy headlines for those
4719	1	si son de la ceiba
4720	1	nah check out honduras they tolerated joh dictatorship because he is happy to have yank dick in his asshole
4721	1	i really look forward to your answer
4722	1	have him watch sanky panky
4723	1	that is suck but at least in honduras we do have a mass movement that are trying to make the country better and we rejected foreign intervention even if they have good intentions because the problem should be solved with honduran themselves the movement helped prove the election was fraud and we are forming the militant in case the government continue to ignore usthis is why your opposition is weak rather than depending on foreigners to do their job they should depend on venezuelans to their job to bring back freedom are you sending aids to them i do and i wouldnt be surprised if they will kidnap me
4724	1	where were you in honduras were you there as part of some sort of religious service generally in the cities we dont get too many foreigners outside of the hotel and mall area so people are usually curious and ask questions taxi drivers will want to chat cashiers will ask questions and sometimes kids will get excited and try to practice their english in my grandma is small town in copan everyone would want to talk to you for hours there are more isolated places though where people would be suspicious of and hostile towards you
4725	1	latino by definition refers to origin or descent you can still be latino and born in the us take a look at the dictionary and there are areas in the us with such massive communities the cultural ties are absolutely undeniable and spanish language and culture supersedes americananglo culture its not just black and white
4726	1	just like your country from what i know
4727	1	where are you from
4728	1	lol facts
4729	1	then your haitian too what is your mom btw
4730	1	be honest is the big butt thing true i know it is for my caribbean girls those stereotypes about brasilian girls exist for a reason
4731	1	are spaniards still very macho i thought that was an old school trait that they gave to hispanic america when they colonised
4732	1	what does that have to do with me looking for other haitians in this sub reddit
4733	1	elaborate only spain had a claim to central america with the exception of britian with belize former british honduras
4734	1	i mean as long as it is not prostitution they should just embrass their nice female bodies
4735	1	thats cool whats it like did you move to miami plently of cubans and other caribbeans there like you never left the caribbean
4736	1	maybe
4737	1	thanks bro ill see if i can make it there i heard some black cubans even still speak yoruba is that true
4738	1	true id say it is mostly the governments trying to pit us against each other to distract their people from their own corruption but here in the us we always get along ive found haitians and dominicans are the most similar to each other and always adopt each other as family only difference is the language
4739	1	you haitian too
4740	1	thanks for correcting me
4741	1	take me with you nect time
4742	1	are you refering to dominicans or puerto ricans or both as a haitian the spanish genocided most of our native taïno people with 50 years of arriving aside from us having native blood they are extinct we are mostly black people then mullato white and lastly some kind of asian
4743	1	lol l why do you say that
4744	1	cuba and venezuala have a history with haiti for a while how does cuba and cubans see haiti
4745	1	good
4746	1	youre the homies for that
4747	1	whats up fam
4748	1	lol facts
4749	1	where are you from
4750	1	describe the fun situations sounds interesting
4751	1	hope your doing well id love to go to cuba oone day ive been trying to practice my spanish with my hispanic friends
4752	1	i didnt say every spaniard raped native women but on my island hispaniola thats the first thing tthat happened when they came with colombus as soon as he came back to ayiti haiti he found the spaniards from the wrecked santa maria dead they died killing themselves over gold or women or being killed by the taïno for trying to rape their women
4753	1	thats just the internet bro their mad dominicans talking shit about haitians on youtube but every one ive ever met is mad cool we become instant friends
4754	1	but there are no more taïno in our islands
4755	1	come to think of it i havent seen any boricuas
4756	1	were the first latin american country so yeah not sure why there arent more haitians here
4757	1	im fine bro looks like haiti and brasil are the only latin american countries that arent hispanic
4758	1	what does maricao mean im haitian
4759	1	how involved are other dominicans in participating in using prostitutes though do they at least respect the age of consent or is it not really upheld
4760	1	i know but i assumed from my brasilian friends the most natives living outside the jungle were absorbed into the prieto popultion
4761	1	thank really cool id expect this of other caribbean coutries with more african heritage but this is cool
4762	1	they are part of france not their own country
4763	1	sanky pankys also how is this looked on in dominican society to see grown adults with children are these people from such poor areas that this is the only way the can afford to live
4764	1	goals bro some caribbean country haas to do well just make sure all the developement money comming in isnt embezeled by your corrupt politicians ayiti and borikén know that too well
4765	1	haitians and mexicans actually synergize very well
4766	1	just go to miami or new york but be sure to ask for haitian food we only speak creole otherwise you wont get any
4767	1	yes but belize is a common wealth and wasnt guatemla part of mexico lol dont you guys argue about that too  i only found out im half belizean when i was 15 not salty cuz i dont care had never noticed it on a map but where do guatemalans get that from do you want access to the caribbean sea that bad
4768	1	what country do you live in
4769	1	true about the napoleon thing not sure many hispanic latinos in the us know that but latin american is just a linguistic thing were you colonized by france spain or portugal either way latin america began in the caribbean with colombus landing in ayiti haiti  his brother colonizing the dominican republic and haiti became the first independent latin american and caribbean country  ayiti boriken cuba and the dominican republic are both we speak our own language though so were kind of by ourselves idk if there are other former french colonies that are part of latin america they seem to have been later colonized by the english or still be part of france we dont call ourselves latino though because it sounds stupid it is latiné in our language anyway
4770	1	guiana isnt a country though it is a department of france
4771	1	i though prieto eas more like mixed with afro euro and native blood and pardo was more black correct me since i seem to be wrong
4772	1	correct me if im wrong but dont the police allow it
4773	1	glad they are doing well there i hope they are learning portuguese well i know im trying to learn
4774	1	that would be me
4775	1	not even competing for the best central american country with costa rica
4776	1	what does guatemala and belize have to do with anything argentina and the falklands also the spanish tried to claim belize guatemala doesnt have any claim
4777	1	do you live in cuba or did you move
4778	1	how did you get the costume mark next to your name
4779	1	might be a caribbean thing though it doesnt really seem to be common with the anglo side
4780	1	always happy to see a brasilian as well hispanic arent the only people in latin america we have to represent
4781	1	and what do you think that would be
4782	1	this sucks are there still many natives in brasil that dont live in the amazon
4783	1	they raped the women which produced mestizos
4784	1	of course your latin american the caribbean is where it all started ayiti borikén cuba and the dr just because the us made pr a territory doesnt change that latin america means the country speaks a latin language
4785	1	chill fam im haitian
4786	1	do you still live in cuba i thought internet was mosy restricted there
4787	1	no i understand thank you
4788	1	im haitianamerican just answering the question
4789	1	to be fair texas is one of the few states i would expect people outside from the us to have an opinion of the other two being california and new york it is not like he is asking about wyoming
4790	1	we are in europe apparently
4791	1	there is a lot of black mexicans in guerrero is costa chica el país recently did a piece on adalid maganda a black mexican referee and the discrimination he faces in his own country
4792	1	youve had a shit economic policy for 40 years and chavezmaduro have been a part of thatthats my defense of chavez acording to you
4793	1	its happened plenty of times the economy of venezuela has crashed at regular intervals over the decadeshttpswwwimforgexternaldatamapperngdp_rpchweooemdcadvecweoworld
4794	1	yes we do not have such freedom of movement as other countries in latam in fact we need a visa to enter brasil
4795	1	those goddamn mexicans s
4796	1	no its isnthttpsenwikipediaorgwikilist_of_latin_american_and_caribbean_countries_by_gdp_pppand if it was normal bolivia wouldnt receive the praise it does
4797	1	why do you like chaves so much dont think we are very different since brazilians feel identified with el chavo
4798	1	there are not such thing as yellow cheese
4799	1	op is probably confusing the excercises last week of russian tu160 in venezuela with the establishment of a military base russia doesnt have military bases in america
4800	1	wow very different from mexican rancho
4801	1	chihuahua
4802	1	a typical american answer
4803	1	rmexico is 50 brown skin americans who have set foot in mexico once or twice in their lifetime and 50 delusional conservatives who think calderón was a great president unsubbed that fraud of a sub 5 days after subbing
4804	1	they refer to mexican americans pochos not real mexicans as a mexican from mexico i feel closer to other latin americans than i do to pochos its sad that being mexican has been reduced to a caricature in the eyes of americans
4805	1	it used to be a place where you could get free software and movies and shit now its 4chans retarded spinoff
4806	1	gt rudo y cursii love that fucking movie xd
4807	1	cries in mexican
4808	1	youre right i think in mexico is supposed to celebrate mestizos and indigenous people
4809	1	is this video real httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuuosuhaxmx8httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuuosuhaxmx8
4810	1	es naquisimo
4811	1	i mean it depends on how you use the word if you say i love indios i wouldnt thaink that is offensive classist nor  derogatory
4812	1	con el titular de lo desmaman a piedrazos
4813	1	have you considered driving to other countries
4814	1	not chilean but in mexico german communities were generally looked well upon in fact our government actively looked to bring over german and other europeanlebanese immigrantshell there are still german schoolsuniversities and german surnames arent too uncommon here german mexicans are also quite affluent
4815	1	i think so i believe he is more a dodgers guy since he has an autographed ball and everythinghttpswwwinformadormx__export1539828489469siteselinformadorimg201810173_1_crop1539828462865jpg_1970638775jpg
4816	1	gt
4817	1	isnt that just a free trade agreement
4818	1	same here i live in boston and me and my wife who is american constantly dream about living in a place where you have enough money left over for groceries after rent my only fear is that in america only 4 of people doing my job do not have degrees in mexico where education is more universal i doubt anyone will hire me
4819	1	people from the atlantic coast also curse a lot but at least they dont shout when they speak here in the north is like no stoy enojao yo así hablo cabrón
4820	1	gtand chile is expected to have a growth rate of 4 this yearyeah and it grew by 15 last year while bolivia grew by 42 and 43 before that and 49 before that thats the remarkable thing here thats its a sustained growth over several years years that have seen worldwide economic crashes not sudden outburstsgtpoorer countries will grow at a higher rateif that was true and it was a 11 conversion as youre claiming saint kitts y nevis the smallest country in america economically would be the fastest growing its not growth doesnt have exact equivalences much less based on size alone
4821	1	pretty much
4822	1	that to measure cumulative growth as youre trying to youd have to take into account the time of the growth you want to measure which fine but economic growth is measure in yearly percentages and its not linear either so you cant say madagascar is a 3 and peru is a 7 and since they both grew by 1 then its an overall 9
4823	1	yes i understand the concept its just something i do not think i will enjoybut i will give it a chance one day
4824	1	look from my point of view a spaniard who is ruled by a king imposed by a fascist dictator or a gringo who has spent the last 100 or so years being ruled by the exact same 2 political parties who just switch power between themselves has no bearing in calling others on moral perspectives moral so the argument is that bolivia is evilnow does the reelection sucks i guess so the bolivians seemed to think so in the referendum so i guess they will show it in the ballots but it was approved by the legislative and judicial powers in the country so in this case its actually you who is disrespecting their institutions
4825	1	ustedes son bien latinos no se hagan a ver si no bailas si te pongo una cumbia bien buena
4826	1	gtmexican americans in the us claim theyre full mexican and act like a stereotypical mexican and not like a real one when they come to mexico they claim theyre americans and have some sort of sense of superiority just because they were born in the statesi am mexican and live in the us i can share a few anecdotes with you every time i come back to the us from visiting my home country the mexican american customs officials give me the hardest time the white customs officials just stamp my passport but the mexican american officials ask me a million questions and are very rude they are always suspicious of me and think i am a drug mule
4827	1	personal choice i guess to me and many mexicans christmas is a cultural holiday
4828	1	dont be an asshole
4829	1	how does el salvador has the credit for the independencewait why do you have nahuatl related peoples all the way over there
4830	1	i guess that is something latin america as a whole shares in common with the balkans lots of wasted potential
4831	1	they dont care about your rights they care about their money if thrown down your goverment is convinient for them they will if dont you can die
4832	1	that is what i meant you cant smoke everywhere
4833	1	i know people that was born in the usa but their parents are not even immigrants just book the birth in a better hospital in the other side is common at the border many of those people chose to live in mexico even in adulthood simply because they feel that the usa is not their home or they miss the freedom at home
4834	1	that is actually cool cops here will harass you and try to steal money from you if they ever see you smoking weed
4835	1	me either i dont like it but i understand it
4836	1	ignore this guy its a parody of the antiamerican leftist
4837	1	ive been seeing the historical gdp and ppp scores of venezuela over the last 30 or so years and the so called heaven looks quite shitty lots of pitfalls over the years one of those would be equivalent to a major economic crisis here in mexico and venezuela has a much smaller economy but they sometimes get several in a single decade
4838	1	sure but not today
4839	1	i like el economista
4840	1	depends on what you consider better i cant speak for bolivia or uruguay but cuba is not what id consider a good example of a succesful socialist dictatorship
4841	1	id point out the differences between criticism and judgement in this case i can criticise the conquistadors actions but to judge them as inherently evil because of those actions is wrong imo its like disliking your great grandpa because hes a bit racist for example would it be better if he werent racist of course but hes not evil he was just raised in a very different context
4842	1	because damn near everyone has relatives over there myself included and many get that perception from their chicano relatives
4843	1	ignore him
4844	1	i never said that actually
4845	1	oh no baseball is hugely popular in the northern states the coming president is actually a big fanhttpcfvodkalturacomp2051731sp205173100thumbnailentry_id1_xzqyh475version0width800 even though he is from the south
4846	1	maybe you should use a vpn as someone already suggested
4847	1	rshitamericanssay
4848	1	i agree but he hasnt really proven himself much better than previous presidents
4849	1	ah then they are definitely confusing it the tu160 is were deployed last week for joint excersises last week to la orchila and they are already back in russiahttpsactualidadrtcomvideo299201bombarderosrusosregresanbasesmaniobras la orchila houses a venezuelan military basehttpsenwikipediaorgwikila_orchila and russia has no military bases in americahttpsenwikipediaorgwikilist_of_russian_military_bases_abroad russian sources themselves are also denying the base rumorhttpsactualidadrtcomactualidad299451ojalafueraverdaddiosdadocabelloi had a conversation down below with another person convinced of the same but his own articles said the whole thing was a joint excersise at the very least venezuela hasnt allowed any such thing
4850	1	if your country is not in the world cup or doing fine in the uefa championship we dont even know your country exists
4851	1	you dont need to be 100 indigenous to realize that cortez was a prick
4852	1	sure id like to see it
4853	1	hoy venia en una camioneta con un amigo de un cuate verga que en el trafico abre la puerta saca la cabeza y escupe procede a hacerlo 2 veces mas en un trayecto de 15 minutosno soy tan radical como mi abuela pero si se vio muy cochino el cabron muy naco indeed

4856	1	from your own articlegt it is in this aspect that the flight to venezuela of a russian air group headed by two strategic tu160 missile carriers should be considered joint exercises in which the pilots of the two countries will take partoh andgtrusia desplegará una base militar en el caribeso it hasnt done so yet thenthere is indeed nothing i can do on the power of selfsuggestion
4857	1	uh
4858	1	really i would say they arent like luisito comunica he is a bit obnoxious but i definitely wouldnt say arrogant
4859	1	i didnt realize that kosher ambulances were a thing until someone sent me a picture of one in polanco i mean it makes sense i just didnt know about it
4860	1	wait what you mean to tell me it isnt
4861	1	it grew by 8 while bolivia grew by 6 but they didnt had the following pitfalls ups and downs are not something to aim forand i mean you should be aiming for sustainable growth not sudden outbursts you cant sustain thats a bubblemost of asia suffered a series of crisises due to the growth rates they facedhttpsenwikipediaorgwiki1997_asian_financial_crisis thats the other side of it why do you think places like japan have coin denominations from the 100 isbut you know your country better than i do if you think you think paraguay can sustain a 7 growth and i personally dont think you can given your ups and downs go ahead aim for it just again be sure you can sustain it
4862	1	gt i think one of the reasons the number of us citizens living in mexico is so high is that a significant proportion are people born from mexican parents in the us that came back to mexicofor statistical purposes they dont count as american they count as mexican if you are a mexican citizen you are not counted as a foreign residing in mexico it doesnt matter if you werent born here now if you could be a citizen but you have chosen to not be one you obviously count as a foreign residing in mexico as getting a job permit is really hard in mexico is way easier to just get the mexican citizenship if you can get one than going for all the process of getting a work permit as a foreigner now im speculating of course i dont have hard data to back up or deny what you just said
4863	1	i guess not too many though
4864	1	yeah and orchila island houses a venezuelan military basehttpsenwikipediaorgwikila_orchila not a russian onehttpsenwikipediaorgwikilist_of_russian_military_bases_abroadrussia doesnt have permanent bases in america much less one with the capacity to house strategic bombers and its accompanying requirements case in point your own article says it was a training excersisegt russian pilots performed not just a simple training flight but covered a distance of more than 10000 kilometers over the atlantic ocean the barents the norwegian and the caribbean seas
4865	1	dude people from sinaloa ayer iba manejando y verga un pinche bache de la verga wey estaba gigante esa mamada pinche cráter a la verga esa madre me chingó la puta llanta a la verga no mames me va a costar un putero arreglarla
4866	1	same here
4867	1	this it really depends on the country brazil colombia and venezuela and big on cosmetic surgeries for women especially butt and breast implants
4868	1	es cierto lo vi con mis dieciocho ojos
4869	1	normal  difficult  press start look má i can read english probably im not the only one but my parents were very proud i was able to read video game english
4870	1	that analogy would work if growth was cumulative and linear and then youd be missing time factors in there but its percentileand again we are not  talking about all of bolivia but the growth it has shown during morales is terms
4871	1	when did that happened
4872	1	but a lot of people here specifically in the tourist areas feel that they gotta appease them because gringosmoney to them
4873	1	dont feel bad mexican spanish in chicago was probably not what you would hear in mexico unless you hung out with actual mexicans born and raised in mexico living in chicago for whatever reason and also narcos tried to have an accent from northern mexico which is a bit different tooi love spanish shows and trust me for some of them specially andalusian like ahí abajo i need subtitles so it goes both ways
4874	1	i dont like to promote stereotypes but compared to argentinos and uruguayos chileans are not as attractive in my opinion argentina and uruguay have the most attractive people followed by brazil venezuela and colombia least attractive would be the northern triangle countries guatemala el salvador honduras i have to mention that there is attractive and unattractive people everywhere and this is just my opinion
4875	1	ive been in mexico for 9 years my wife and son were both born here and i became a citizen in augustgood enough
4876	1	yeah my family is from catalonia they migrated to mexico because they were forbidden to speak their own language and 3 out of 4 members of my grandfather friend is group were imprisioned for defending their culture so yeah their problem was not economic
4877	1	i still dont think a woman should play the character kids are expecting the real santa     if a character is black then the actor is black if the character is a man then the actor is a man     yes there are way more male characters in comics and old stories but this is not the solution the solution is for new to represent the new population and its ideals
4878	1	yes you said that already again thats the remarkable thing here thats its a sustained growth over several years years that have seen worldwide economic crashes not sudden outbursts
4879	1	ah then it might be that i honestly find sportwatching boring in general so im not very well informed
4880	1	sure but it doesnt have the prestige of proceso nor the long history of la jornada so i dont think you can call it the country is newspaper
4881	1	it would be cool
4882	1	yeah and orchila island houses a venezuelan military basehttpsenwikipediaorgwikila_orchila not a russian onehttpsenwikipediaorgwikilist_of_russian_military_bases_abroadrussia doesnt have permanent bases in america much less one with the capacity to house strategic bombers and its accompanying requirements case in point your own article says sogt russian pilots performed not just a simple training flight but covered a distance of more than 10000 kilometers over the atlantic ocean the barents the norwegian and the caribbean seas
4883	1	idk why they didnt do that with the previous seasons i mean was it too hard to have a colombian cast i mean the two main capos pablo escobar and gilberto rodríguez had no believable accents
4884	1	yes there is a ton of smokers at least in the city youll find more smokers than nonsmokers
4885	1	same i finally understand when americans would say that despite disagreeing with trump they still wanted him to succeed i may not love all his ideas but i want him to do well
4886	1	same here

4894	1	interesting
4895	1	that is a shame the balkans have a stupidlyhigh tourist potential you guys have some beautiful sights and an incredible history
4896	1	did you know that a referendum was held to increase the constitutional limit of terms and he lost it and he is running for another term against his own law
4897	1	im from houston and i happily celebrate things like thanksgiving from the usi also make an altar on the day of the day of the dead  so that my friends who are no longer physically here  can be here with me and be alive with usso certainly i am from both cultures and im guessing by your on flair that you can understand that too

4910	1	no persian my bad
4911	1	i know how it works i was just asking which expression is used the most
4912	1	asian americans not asians
4913	1	those cases are when people take it too far

4920	1	true amlo is a thief and should be in jail though
4921	1	that is not entirely accurate since there are a few sensible people there but it seems like youre mostly right
4922	1	gtbright regardless since bolivia has the largest lithium reservesi see what you did there
4923	1	i feel every mexican has been involved in the white people are looked well upon conversation kinda like the why do asians do well in brazil question that was brought up a few days back
4924	1	oh yeah thats a good way of putting it i think the new arrivals wish to integrate so hard they become even more stereotypical than the actual people they are trying to integrate into
4925	1	no of course not i just said it is earning its place somewhere in the good journalism section despite being new
4926	1	haiti was also an empire technically
4927	1	i dont know how it is reported in english speaking media but in the spanish speaking media we got the impression most puertorricans support keeping the status quo with a small minority supporting independence and the rest looking for statehood the last vote apparently was boycotted by all major parties due to the way the ballot was written i dont have an opinion either way hope a boricua can shed some light on the topic
4928	1	again you said that again if it was normal bolivia wouldnt receive the praise it does
4929	1	and día de reyes too
4930	1	i can see that but the same can be said for literally any nationality
4931	1	id say animal politico it is earning its name although it is not a newspaper
4932	1	httpsesmwikipediaorgwikilimpiabotashttpsesmwikipediaorgwikilimpiabotas
4933	1	just to ratify my opinion i dont dislike us people i have really good friends in the usa but the goverments and their struggle for power has fucked up a lot of lifes
4934	1	con razón
4935	1	no but in 31 minutos they use standard spanish i meant more like el reemplazante or los archivos del cardenal
4936	1	rvexillology give us a new one pls
4937	1	again the remarkable thing is not the individual growth but the sustained rate of it paraguay for example had a slump in 2012httpswwwimforgexternaldatamapperngdp_rpchweooemdcadvecweoworld were it shrank by 5 bolivia hasnt faced that during the century so far and that is added to considerable advances in poverty and social mobility during morales is terms
4938	1	cabaña means cabin cottage hut it may be poor but it may not
4939	1	lol
4940	1	youve pretty much summed up mexican attitudes on ethnicity as wellto further add on to this there are many mexican people with asian last names and pretty much all of them speak spanish consider themselves mexican etc of course they have quirks mexicalistyle chow mein for example but theyre no less mexican than anyone elseconversely we have a lot of weird ethnic enclaves but other than that same applies no one is gives a fuck if theyre asian mexican italian mexican spanish mexican lebanese mexican afromexican etc youre mexican no matter what
4941	1	i shouldnt
4942	1	also as if volaris have direct flights to all cities i wonder how he is going to move when a natural disaster hits the country
4943	1	i think it depends on where do you get it from ive seen places in which you get a chorizo that practically crumbles when you fry it and it sorts of becomes little pieces you can sort of spread on the bread ive seen others in which you have a chorizo that doesnt completely crumbles and you get bigger chunks of chorizo when you fry it ive had both in tacos or sandwiches in any case i think you should cut it into smaller pieces if it crumbles then it will cook faster if it doesnt crumble that much you will get small chunks that are easier to put on the bread you should also take into account that chorizo release quite a good amount of grease when you cook it so it isnt really necessary for you to use oil also this characteristic makes it easier to soak the bread and it starts falling apart if you want to prevent it i would advice you to spread some beans on the bread or to put some cheese on it
4944	1	also baja california is nothing like the rest of the north
4945	1	calle 13 talks about all the stereotypical stuff but then a whole lot more he has at least 2 songs that legit make me cry when im drunkenly watching youtube at 2 am latinoamerica and ojos color a sol although that is a cover
4946	1	ive never seen anyone get offended by this either but i just try to be nice especially in this season you know the christmas spirit
4947	1	lol latin americans arent saints eitherrmexico loves to trash on chicanospochos and antimigrant sentiment is more open these days and yes there are connotations to skin color central americans are basically seen as barbarians
4948	1	looks more like something the inquisition would use
4949	1	i know a girl from cordoba that moved with her family here after the argentina crisis of 2001 i know that there accent is suppose to be different than that of buenos aires but i honestly cant tell the difference i dont know anything about paraná though i guess the language barrier makes it difficult the same thing can be said about sichuan
4950	1	latín
4951	1	they are lowering their povertyhttpswwwwolframalphacominputiboliviapovertyhistory at a relatively quick rate i might addand they are growing faster than you or me so that means they are being wise with the moneygt i thought mexico is poverty rate was a lot lower ours is around 89yeah no wonder there are only 18 million of you your entire population would fit comfortably in our capital city alone
4952	1	dont ignore it its part of the conversation ill repeat it again spaniards dont get to judge other country is institutions as immoral when they have a dictator imposed by another fascist dictator in their governmentagain venezuela this venezuela that if youre so dismayed by disrespecting a country is institutions id recommend you stop stop doing it then if the bolivians dont agree with morales they will outvote him in the ballots you dont have to preach political stability or strogman types particularly as your banner also says us thats 1 hypocrisy and 2 disrespectful to the boliviayou dont like morales for whathever reason fine but you dont get to call another country morally wrong because you dont like it furthermore you also dont get to judge another country is institutions you dont have that rightonce again stop disrespecting other country is institutions
4953	1	on top of that hugo chávez was very retarded he said that humanity existed for 200 hundred years 7852 human genetic map is the same as a fly and andromeda nebulosa
4954	1	again youve had shit economic policy since the 60 is and chavez continued itthats my defense of chavez according to you that youve had a shit economic policy for decades which chavez is part of thats me defending chavez according to you
4955	1	but santos is a commie
4956	1	those damn communist atlantians
4957	1	she is cute
4958	1	nah we are triggered by people who has never visited latinamerica and consider it self latin americans i dont mind immigrants who embrace the land and culture
4959	1	i think venezuela is the place with the most venezuelans
4960	1	besides what most media outlets tell you there is a big portion of mexicans including myself who believe amlo is the worst candidate we have had in decades but whatever floats your boat
4961	1	i really dont mind mexicans born in the us when they are still in contact with their roots and i mean active contact but if they adopt the us culture that is not a bad thing at all i consider them full americans again not a bad thing i just think that ancestry alone doesnt dictate belonging
4962	1	lol which ones iran is out i beet
4963	1	for cases like this i recommend watching about the movie the wave it talks about how with a simple but concise system an evil person can spread a belief without them thinking its evil

4971	1	amen
4972	1	the horrors of chavez were felt since 2003 i think
4973	1	cant be a great nation if it is built on the back of slavery theft violence and for lack of a better word bullying on a global scale to be fair most countries have as well but not on the scale that the us has and the more developed ones have started turning away from those trends you make the same mistake that a lot of americans make and conflate wealth and influence with greatness people have already begun to see the mistakes of the past and attempt to move forward in a more positive way they will be seen with much kinder eyes in the future
4974	1	httpsenmwikipediaorgwikishoeshiner
4975	1	ah im wrong because you said so and because im wrong im defending chavez according to you ok

4984	1	i dont know if they have it in univision now maybe you can try i dont know if they have lik a free trial or something it wont let me check from mexico
4985	1	the nopal is by far the most popular cactus we eat and we pretty much eat everything including the fruit we call it tunahttpswwwmexicodesconocidocommxwpcontentuploads201809nopalbeneficiosycaracteristicasjpgthis is how the plant lookshttpswwwsinembargomxwpcontentuploads201712npalesjpg and this is how one of the dishes made with it lookshttpsiblogsesee7138ensaladanopales11366_2000jpg
4986	1	education and healthcare are free in my country too you know what else is free the election of my governors the option to travel around the world the option to have steak for diner if i want im also free to chose a highspeed internet provider for my house or i can even use the free internet provided by the city and i dont live in no paradise but it is compared to socialist cuba
4987	1	flair pls
4988	1	bad habbit from living in the usa gotta code switch contantly they do not like being told that they are ignorant for calling their country america and as far as party tricks goes it is not an impressive one
4989	1	what state are you from im from cdmx but lived in guerrero too
4990	1	eso es precisamente lo qué nos hace falta en méxico
4991	1	31 political parties bro
4992	1	oh  sorry they have it here have you searched in justwatchhttpswwwjustwatchcom
4993	1	as i said its the exact same pattern as the last 40 years nothing has changed
4994	1	its not russian their sources are denying it httpsactualidadrtcomactualidad299451ojalafueraverdaddiosdadocabello
4995	1	you got your priorities right my friend
4996	1	not that it matters much these days nato isnt based in central america and just ask the africans how much being 2 continents apart kept them away from the chinese spotlight
4997	1	im saying you shouldnt engage in something youre criticizing and accusing me of using a fallacy instead of actually arguing it is ad hominem in itself so
4998	1	i think you posted twice anywaysgta temporary deployment of warplanes is possiblethats the tu160 they sent last week for joint excercises and they are already backhttpsactualidadrtcomvideo299201bombarderosrusosregresanbasesmaniobras
4999	1	seriously i guess weve tried to suck up to the us that we didnt know how our neighbors in central america see us
5000	1	wow everything you said is wrong mexico is not a powerful fully developed nation but you sound like a fox news pundit with your hyperbole corruption and poverty are sadly widespread but not absolute anarchy i guess in some pockets of the country but it is not the norm and it is not how the vast majority of the country lives there is no racial hierarchy it would be pretty fucking stupid since like 80 of us are mixed there are racists undeniable but i have no idea where you pulled this one out from there are literally like a million mayans and why do you mention mayans specifically my guess is that you are one of those idiotic people who only know of mayans and aztecs nahuas and dont know that they are still around plus 60 something other indigenous groups you got me there we have had a lot of dictators and insurrections  but not more than 50in summation you know nothing but what the media tells you
5001	1	whats the difference between a province and a region
5002	1	isnt the psl party big friend with netanyahu
5003	1	triggered
5004	1	the only man i ever greet with a kiss is my father
5005	1	will set up a military base so they dont have a military base nor has venezuela accepted itbesides the article translated specifically said it was an excersicegtrussian pilots performed not just a simple training flight but covered a distance of more than 10000 kilometers over the atlantic ocean the barents the norwegian and the caribbean seas
5006	1	im pretty sure its considered rude in the same way youd tip say an electrician or a doctor since im europe its seen as a full time careerprofession and youre undermining it i think
5007	1	wooow what a poignant defense i did hey should i also defend hittler by saying he had the same shit military policy as imperial germany or how about i defend mao tse tung by saying he had the same military policy as the quing empire how about i defend the us by pointing out they commited the same atrocities as the british empire stuff like that man what incredible defenses
5008	1	gabacho for white gringos
5009	1	not really it does have some hot springs but the main reason there is a japanese community is that there is a nissan factory in the city
5010	1	mostly indifference however if someone starts speaking an extremely rare language like a nordicafrican language which are very uncommon here some people will be amazed particularly because no one would expect someone who is surely a tourist to know the language as to the ones i mentioned in my previous comment most of them work here so it is not unexpected for them to know basic spanish
5011	1	the spanish did a fucking number on us we were brought up on a culture of humility and servitude something that i believe is exclusive to mexico is how we respond to questions mande or the more formal mande usted they roughly mean something like give me an order or you are the one giving orders we use excessively polite speech in my opinion it is from the mindset that was imposed on us y the conquistadors and while other latin american countries may have shaken those ideas off mexico has switched them to apply to a modern context
5012	1	i can confirm that is a conception we have of latinos in here and its not hard to see were it comes from you always hear stories about a friend friend is cousin or something being deported by agent lopez or leuitenant hernandez and they always have this huge cara de pocho that its kind of funny that they are the most conservative ones aroundit wasnt all that surprising to me when news came out that millions of latinos voted for trump for example
5013	1	sorry i assume you are american and yes the country was built on grabbing as much land as possible
5014	1	yes i agree my comment was more along the lines of i dont think the fact that argentina is one of the richest countries from south america is what makes them have a high hdi because richer countries in the same latin american region like brazil or mexico have a lower hdi
5015	1	yeah i was gonna make my post about that in mexico like hugging and kissing people upon introduction for example   living in the usa it too me a while to not be overly touchy thank god that was 20 years ago before it became anathema
5016	1	basically we were the greatgreatgreat land of the incas prehispanic times the capital of spanish political and economic power in south america colonial times and the most important place in the process of south american independence however we were suddenly defeated by the littleunimportant nation of chile during the war of the pacific to see httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwar_of_the_pacific while we peruvians were peaceful people and had amazing cultural and natural richness the chileans envied our sources and provoked a war to steal it with the help of great britain although the original conflict was between bolivia and chile the fact that chile declared war on peru proved their ambition also we had a hero miguel grau who rescued chileans soldiers while they didnt respect our soldiers lives and so on  as a result we lost some southern regions and tons of saltpeter salitre that would have made us richer since the 90s several investments came from chile to our country so many school teachers there are a lot of leftist and nationalist teachers pushed further the idea that chileans are still controlling our economy and taking our money they add this kind of comments out of the record quite often for example once they finish the book chapter  this is just a very general overview of the topic but it does not mean that peruvians believe it just like that actually younger generations are more resistant to his narrative and the education minister is promoting to learn the chilean version at least a bitsource i have worked in the education system for four years
5017	1	i guess it comes to the point of defining standards but i was thinking owning a house in mirafloresbarranco family of 4
5018	1	there are thousands like you
5019	1	the only problem i found is the massive amount of tourists around
5020	1	i was thinking about living alone no family in brasil avenue or san miguel apartments owning a house in miraflores is not a decent life it is actually closer to a luxury lifestyle
5021	1	we also call them cutters in lima
5022	1	we use a comma in peru too
5023	1	same here for most people in my country
5024	1	it is a lie 60k is way too much
5025	1	so you call it chaves is that a last name like the spanish chávez
5026	1	til viveza criolla is used outside peru
5027	1	the same in peru
5028	1	in politics our president pedro pablo kuczynski had to resign because of his involvement with odebrecht here is a new yorker articlehttpswwwnewyorkercomnewsnewsdeskthedownfallofpedropablokuczynskiandthefutureofperu
5029	1	between the borders their real countries hidethere is so much in common between us youd be surprised
5030	1	since there are tons of cheap hotels whose only service is to provide a private room it is not only disrespectful but also a sign that you dont wantarent able to rent a room i hear comments like you are no longer a college student go and find a hotel to do your business or look at that couple they dont even have money to rent a roomampx200bbut that is only in my countrycity not talking for the whole la
5031	1	that is also so true there are names first 2 that just go togetherim pretty sure maria fernanda will prefer the 2 names rather than the first only same as carlos alberto juan carlos maria gracia and list goes on and on
5032	1	no way you get a decent life with 12001400 american dollars monthly renting an average department using public transportation buying food in supermarkets
5033	1	gtid like to know what big political events youre referring toafter the incas and the conquest we learn colonial institutions and authorities colonial economy colonial castas httpsenwikipediaorgwikicasta indigenous rebellions the bourbon reforms in the 18th century httpsenwikipediaorgwikibourbon_reforms preindependence rebellions and ideas here we see our first national heroes the independence process first presidents and caudillismo httpsenwikipediaorgwikicaudillo the guano era httpsenwikipediaorgwikiguano_era and president castilla here we see the freedom of slaves the war of the pacific and a long list of civil or military presidents alongside coups detat and some civil reforms throughout the xx century the most important ones leguía sanchez cerro odría velasco just minor mentions to conflicts with colombia and ecuador few teachers achieve to work the fujimori government and the shining path because of time restrictions and the simple fact that both events are still polemics nowadays so many prefer to avoid themaside from peruvian history dont forget that we also learn about european history  gtshining path guerrillasyou may have a rough time if peruvians hear you to call them guerrillas most people recognize them just as terrorists
5034	1	you forgot gonzalo and valeria
5035	1	well since both la chola cabuca and el negro mama have been cancelled and banned from the national tv networks i can say we are slowly getting to a better place when it comes to segregating our own
5036	1	i thought the phrase was exclusive to us peruvians
5037	1	well id be dead in both regimes so it makes no difference
5038	1	well yeah if pinochet ever comes back ill be sure to let you know before the secret police gets me
5039	1	ah ok i see now why you said 84 for paraguay that year the imf adopted our new gdp calculation which happened this year other sources still have the old one if you google paraguay gdp growth 2013 youll get 14 from the world bank which is what i looked up but you are right and 84 is now the correct one
5040	1	nice that 65 i mentioned is only hydropower
5041	1	true but industrialization is usually the natural path to getting to a postindustrial economy so i think it is useful looking at things historically i am only aware of one exception and that is australia maybe like you say today the path for argentina is different
5042	1	for a country the size of brasil it is a fantastic achievementwe have 100 renewable but our population is only 7 million and we got lucky with the huge rivers
5043	1	yeah we had 5 yearly growth despite brasil and argentina not doing so well i wish they quickly turn things around so we can all benefit
5044	1	bolivia does not have sustained growth at 6 not sure where youre getting that fromgt and i mean you should be aiming for sustainable growth not sudden outbursts you cant sustain thats a bubblewe are in complete agreement i did not say otherwise i only explained what happened in 2012 and 2013 we depended too much on soybean and similarly bolivia depends too much on oilgasparaguay and bolivia can both sustain 7 growth given the right conditions and policy i know both countries pretty well because i live in asuncion but travel to santa cruz for business frequentlygt but you know your country better than i do if you think you think paraguay can sustain a 7 growth and i personally dont think you can given your ups and downsi am pretty certain of it and it is the goal of people here the country is much less volatile than you think we actually have one of the most stable currencies in the americas very low inflation and sustained growth at an average of 5in the end we agree on most everything and there is no argument you think 45 sustained growth is impressive for an underdeveloped country and i think we are so far behind that level is the absolute minimum
5045	1	china has had remarkable growth the asian tigers had more than 20 years at gt 7 gdp growth that is remarkable bolivia and paraguay growing at 45 for a decade is expected given they are underdeveloped we need to aim for 6 annually sustained for 5 years and then i would consider that remarkable
5046	1	well even argentinians from buenos aires are more similar than chileans to us andes mountains are no joke whereas we have very open borders both ways mendoza and south are probably more similar to chileans my point of comparison is relatives who are from santiago though so maybe it is different in your casei vacation in uruguay every year and they are the most similar to us out of all other latam countries imo after northern argentinians then come rosarinos and third porteños i am comparing to asunción by the way which is where half our population resides rural paraguay can be quite different
5047	1	yeah but paraguay grew 14 in 2013it is because back then paraguay was highly dependent on the price of soybeans and in 2012 that dipped that year plus the weather didnt help today we have diversified much more so that should no longer happen that easilymy point is that this is not remarkable sustained gt7 growth for 20 years is remarkable we paraguay and bolivia should be aiming for that what we have achieved is expectedthis for me is remarkablesingapore grew at an average of 91 for a period of 24 years between 1961 and 1984 during that same period korea is average yearly growth was 95 and hong kong 86i can tell you people here are not happy we have reduced poverty similarly to bolivia from 486 in 2012 to 288 today and people here are talking that we need to be growing at 6  7 for a sustained period and that we can do much much better
5048	1	paraguay from 2012 to 2017 reduced their poverty from 486 to 288 with a right wing government and just 10 taxes so it really has more to do with a boom in commodity prices that these countries took advantage of especially the case with bolivia and oilgas prices
5049	1	idk and to be honest i didnt know it existed
5050	1	because they should know better
5051	1	well with maduro i will starve to deathwith pinochet i will be killed by a firing squad or thrown of a helicopter bc i advocate free speech so yeah id be dead in both
5052	1	yeah the only reason we would be excluded is lower level of development which is like northern argentina but we have in common with argentina  uruguaygt 1 in the river plate basingt 2 historically in the same colonial subdivision we say we got our independence from spain argentines say we got it from argentina people from asunción refounded buenos airesgt 3 yerba mategt 4 voseogt 5 tons of italian immigrantsgt 6 personality chileans are more individualisticgt 7 cattle ranching  soybeansgt 8 mercosurgt 9 nazis jkwe dont have much in common culturally with bolivia or the andean countriesid say if you define it geographically we are definitely in if you define it culturally we are much more similar to argentina  uruguay than chile basing it on my chilean relatives or brazil if you define it economically we can be out but we are about the same as northern argentinai was taught paraguay was in the cono sur but now i did some google searches and i find it included in most cases and excluded sometimes
5053	1	yet spain had less gdp per capita in 1950 than argentina venezuela and chile and was at about the same level as peru colombia and mexicodid we fail to develop like they did because of the institutions and culture they left behind
5054	1	definitely the growth was linked to the commodity price boom same as in paraguay but it seemed like even with falling prices that the economy was able to sustain growth like i said i am not bolivian but always look to their economy with interest thanks for the insightif i may ask would you say the influx of chinese money has a overall negative or positive effect on the economy
5055	1	gt argentina barely has 80000 people in their military and barely any ships i dont even think they have submarines they do dont know how many but remember that argentine submarine that sank last yeari think your aicraft figures are very inflated wikipedia says 23 su30 and 19 f16s those look to be the only modern fighters global firepower had total aircraft at 280brazil is stronger than colombia or venezuela though i disagree there brazil even has an aerospace sector and builds their own aircraft sure maybe they are not as modern as some of colombia isi agree with you conclusion though if we were to place their militaries on neutral ground with no outside interference right now venezuela wins in reality argentina would win
5056	1	damn puerto montt looks beautiful in google images
5057	1	i said it was not  inherently bad so we are in agreementit is the right way because the state doesnt control the actual extraction and engineering and cant fuck up like pdvsa those countries you mentioned have state oil companies but not monopolies in the upstream sectorbolivia only allow 2 reelections and morales is on his 4th does that seem democratic it is heading towards a dictatorship not one currently
5058	1	id take none of those cuz both are tyrannical bastards on their respective extreme
5059	1	for sure but the damage is done and was done in the 70s and 80s and i am glad it was that and not coal or oil we dont need to build another power plant for a long time with yacyreta acaray and itaipú
5060	1	rriodelaplata
5061	1	is it true in argentina you kiss twice
5062	1	and the most pessimistic is 9 million which is still more than chile
5063	1	you mean ceceo seseo is what all of latam does and barely anyone in spain is ceceanteonly people from western andalusia
5064	1	but think about the symmetry with two
5065	1	the imf isnt the usa most of the imf directors are european but yes i also think thats a debt trap
5066	1	who was your favorite character mine was the flea
5067	1	he really is a cunt isnt he
5068	1	shoulda woulda coulda
5069	1	k        so you cant actually support your own claim and your only refuge is lame insults good job there          ive given you concrete examples of why imperialism is good for you personally why would you think im another selfabsorbed stinky condescending liberal who likes to spew their holierthanthou antiimperialist rhetoric all over the web while swimming in the spoils of the very same imperialism          and youve yet to tell me any way  even the smallest  that ive benefited from brazil         youre really making some excellent points here two thumbs way way up
5070	1	this is selfabsorbed thinking
5071	1	thank you
5072	1	from what i read up they are still primarily capitalistic in economy
5073	1	it really depends we know the government has done things like the contra affair but the map linked above really is exaggerated for example panama went as far as declaring war on us in the 1989 incident before we ever took action and it has never been proven that the american government had any prior knowledge of the 2004 haitian coup détat
5074	1	it is not that there shouldnt be a difference for any logical or linguistic reason it just sounds funny like everybody has a lisp
5075	1	the pronoun vos can also be used with close friends though right either that or my friends are fucking with me

5081	1	the usa other countries are also federations of united states like the estados unidos mexicanos  why do people call it the united states as if its the only one
5082	1	haha true on both counts  we commonly do that and it is kind of weird
5083	1	sorry my spanish vocab is small what does balanceado mean
5084	1	here its both in alcoholic drinks and even coffee which is odd to me because theyre just drinks i dont understand making it a point of pride to drink black instant coffee past laughing at me for wasting money on something mostly sugar bc thats fair
5085	1	im not jealous at all i have ancestry from like half of europe but it is neat that a random mestizo will likely have distant ancestors from three continents and all the major monotheistic faiths
5086	1	55 of discretionary spending so about 18th of all spending if that this is why foreigners shouldnt be so quick to make bold claims about countries they dont know
5087	1	i dunno when i lived in brazil i saw a different dynamic happening at least in consumer goods in which brazilian companies generally benefitted from protectionist tariffs brazilianmade goods were lowerquality than what youd find in other countries they didnt have to raise quality because price differences kept foreignmade goods from competing directly with them youd find this in clothing musical instruments and so on more so than helping brazilian industry it hurt brazilian consumers and prevented brazilian industry from being competitive on an international leveli also heard people mostly on the left invoke entreguismo in relation to petrobras and the sale of the presalt fields saying that allowing foreign companies instead of the state oil company to extract oil would be handing over the brazilian people is wealth to foreign actors given that the pt was busy using petrobras to enrich itself at the expense of the people over the past decade casting foreign business as the sole villain here seems like a bit of a blind spot of course it is not like the private sector has a much better track recordgt all the so called developed countries did the oppositethis is a really broad sweeping claim  do you have anything to back it up
5088	1	ty also thank you for describing them especially about the 20 pages dedicated to calling a character ugly i love that the serial killer book was the one meant for children
5089	1	to be technical the last syllable of roberto would be with a u sound instead of an o sound in most varieties of brazilian portuguese
5090	1	why looks nice
5091	1	the atm is what really kills it that said taxis will take a long route intentionally to drive up the price for tourists so if u didnt know before now you do
5092	1	what does that have to with illustrations it could easily have been a translation from portuguese or english on one side and portuguese on the other i wanted to know if it was the sake of density of shakespeares language or trying engage student with literature a lot of them can find boring initially or the teacher liked that medium
5093	1	sure but your great grandpa is alive to suffer from your unfairness if someone is long dead is it that harmful for them to be despised for actions that we nowadays would see as horrible i agree your way of viewing things would be the most ideal but also requires a lot of cognitive effort that could be spent on other things although maybe if we got too comfortable doing it with dead people it might spill over to live people or have other negative consequences not sure
5094	1	precisely sf is a shithole despite metricsyou can repeat memes all day great lobbying isnt legalized corruption thats rim14andthisisdeep shit same with inmate slavery
5095	1	puerto rico being  independent  would be a lot harder than simply wanting to be independent regardless of what a vote about it implies and its worth noting that those votes that say they want to become a state also get ignored so unless its in the us best interest and the interest of the sitting congress or president its unlikely the resulting consensus of those votes matter for sovereignty or statehood of puerto rico the elections you mentioned where the result is overwhelmingly for statehood have about 25 voter turn out i dont pretend to know the general consensus of puerto ricans but those votes themselves cannot be used to accurately gauge it especially when a lot of people protest them by not voting edited because i overvalued how many votes for statehood
5096	1	similarly here depending on the grade some authors were introduced to show literary forms andor history like edgar allen poe for short stories and poems while harper lee would be for the civil rights movement and injustice in us criminal system or grapes of wrath about the dust bowlgreat depression and migrant farmers and also alternating narration the crucible was used for talking about the red scare and mccarthyism but also an example of how authors will use other times and places to critique their current realities especially to get around censorship  i dont know if i could recognize the style of us literature thank you for this list tho the books sound interesting
5097	1	i dont think i am but lets agree to disagree  spanish speakers can go on calling it the estados unidos and the rest of the world can go right on calling it america  a happy medium
5098	1	or just downvote without answering lol
5099	1	gt so the china is debt trap of venezuela is most definitely a thing to be blamed on their politicians for signing such a loan but wouldnt have happened if the usa didnt lower the oil prices for its geopolitical gainsa couple of things venezuela previously set their budget always assuming the barrel at production cost 30 usd per specifically because it knew that there are oil gluts it happened first in 1980 when they realized they shouldnt do that and again in the 1990s where the crisis wasnt even bad because of specifically this policynow the peak of oil prices in the history of the oil industry was 2008 when these deals were made the government of venezuela signed the dumbest trade deal ever because there is no way in hell oil prices will ever stay that high or come back to that price unless there is a giant war in the middle east everyone knew this which is why you dont see the other opec nations struggling and why norway even made an index fund with its oil profits the us has always been trying to make more oil to cease having foreign dependency on opec nations this has been known since the gulf war of the 1970s thats like being upset that your neighbor quit buying your potatoes and growing their own because you tried to sell them by 3x their price
5100	1	i too would be hostile 0
5101	1	there are some things that the majority should not be able to do the outright murder of gay people would be bad regardless of whether the evangelical majority wants it or not denying gay marriage is the same logic but with tax benefits and family issues instead of death

5115	1	a road trip is still a road trip though
5116	1	oh i see your pa
5117	1	how are you is a basic greeting in the us so it should be pretty general throughout regions tho people in cities have reputations to be less friendly bc the idea of always having somewhere to be  and in a rush to be  there and the city never sleeps ive heard midwest cities are bit different but idk howa californian i meet compared california and the northeast usa and  she thought that north eastern people tend to be more friendly to strangers and small talk in elevators thing but also more high strung compared to california being much more laid back and less friendly to strangers it confuses me that other countries dont ask how are you as much why are we seen as excessive with it besides customer service

5123	1	thanks for taking interest in this old post lol well i will repeat what i asked someone else who didnt respond feel free to answer any parts that you are knowledgeable abouti know that pretos velhos are supposed to be the spirits of deceased slaves which is something i find fascinating because it reminds me of the prevalence of ancestor worship in many religions around the world can you also explain a bit about zé pelintra it is interesting seeing a religious entity wearing more modern style clothing in this case something like an old zoot suit rather than traditional clothingalso as a bonus do you listen to os tincoãs

5137	1	most black americans would disagree with you my friend just because rap music is popular amongst all groups of youth doesnt mean that black people feel that it necessarily should be a common quote that comes to mind is white people think that black culture is for everyone there are some rappers like post malone and logic that are associated with white people rather than rappers like chief keef or pusha t  more hardcore gangster rap and drill music is not stuff that your typical white person who listens to rap would know about theres a joke that white people that listen to rap only like mainstream mostly lighter skinned or goofy looking rappers drake future kendrick lamar chance etc in terms of other activities im sure you know that black people are mostly into basketball and maybe football if they are bigger sorts of people basketball is basically its own subculture amongst black people and more important to black people than any other group by a long shot white people have more diversified sports interests in terms of television outside of cartoons there is a whole realm of shows that mostly black people watch like the shows on bet vh1 and oprahs channelagain the fact that the phrase white people stuff exists shows that their are many differences socially and culturally between black and white americans let alone others these differences are noted in the way food is prepared to what types of clothing are considered fashionableim not trying to make any value judgement here besides disapproving of the gatekeeping in the black community im just stating the facts on the ground that i have noticed as a black person who is relatively in tune with his peers
5138	1	in english america isnt considered the name of a continent either  we consider north america and south america to be separate continents  once in a great while we might refer to north americans or south americans but really those are groupings with fairly low utility
5139	1	yeah but the caribbean coast of south america has a lot more in common with the dr than it does with the southern cone
5140	1	huh  theres definitely a stigma associated with eating alone in restaurants or going to movies alone it took me a long time to get over that  ive never heard of it being considered weird to go on a walk or to the park by yourself maybe the beach though  thats super interesting to me about your argentine perspective do people frequently dine alone in restaurants though
5141	1	among other things its a product of not having a dictatorship
5142	1	gringo actually comes from spain back in the day there was an irishspanish catholicism alliance which resulted in a lot of irishmen showing up in spain the irish had trouble with spanish and the spaniards would often say estan hablando griego or es todo griego para mi the irish understanding they were being spoken about would respond in their poor spanish si yo gringoand from there spain spread it to the colonies

5159	1	eh vote boycotts have points to them but ill agree they rarely achieve or express the point theyre meant to but i dont agree that even if all of puerto rico wanted to be a state we would necessarily look at that result beyond   thats nice the current dominant party might offer statehood if they think it would get them more voters

5172	1	okay pal whatever youre typing on was made by supply chains through china and taiwan
5173	1	why is this a common mindset
5174	1	most french americans are cajuns or descended from french canadians there is a huge population of descendants of french canadian immigrants in new england so they usually identify with those heritages rather than france specifically
5175	1	could you expand on what you mean about intolerance
5176	1	in the us customer service tends to be woman heavy i wanna day its tied to hospitality being associated with women so that doesnt surprise me but idk  if thats the same or same logic in brazil cashiers here tho i think is fairly unisex but i wouldnt be surprised if over the counter andor cashier things leaned towards women

5186	1	i figure this may be the general response given the age demographics of this sub

5188	1	hope youll all forgive me for kicking this hornet nest nobody else ever gets called an american do they  usually we dont identify people by the continent they come from but even if we did wed say south american or north american  is it done differently in spanish  do people complain about calling the usa america because they feel it diminishes the other residents of the americas somehow  that its a product of us arrogance

5242	1	thats not lobbying you dont even know what lobbying is or more likely youre like eh close enough nothing to do with each other but close enough
5243	1	i was trying to think of advantages over dogs i was thinking more new apartments gt mice problems  i was grasping at straws tho
5244	1	youre the japanese brasilian guy right so you have a particular perspective on this ha i dont know why i was downvoted for simply sharing a video that i didnt even say i agreed with
5245	1	while were on the topic of people who cant tell accents apart chileans semiregularly think im mexican im a gringo from maine literally as far from mexico as you can get in the us and learned my spanish from puerto ricans guatemalans and here in chile i think they just hear me speaking slow and not cutting words and  im mexican but it is still bizarre
5246	1	what do you mean by saying brazilian that is it are you talking about selfidentification because in america it goes without saying that most people you encounter are american when people are talking about their ethnic or cultural background they arent going to say im an american because that is irrelevant and doesnt tell the other person anything useful people here are proud of the subcultures that they belong to as im sure people in brasil are too afrobrasilian is definitely a thing people call themselves ive read enough on the internet about the historical experiences of black brasilians and their culture to discern this but probably not to the same extentwe also have a ton of immigrants and immigrant descendants so why wouldnt they still have bits of their culture with them that distinguishes them from other people another american from a different subreddit said that most americans apparently came here within the past 100 or so years so we have a lot of different cultures here for each group many americans especially recent immigrants and black americans are against assimilating to a uniform culture or standards so the idea of just being american is palatable for many and more of a right wing viewpoint ampx200b
5247	1	i guess what im saying is that europe is very densely packed with very distinct cultures compare french vs german culture  both mostly caucasian  and peruvian vs chilean culture obviously the latter are still different but much less so id argue your ability to group these cultures under a common group label europeans doesnt remove that difference just like me calling you all latin americans doesnt mean you have a homogenous culture either that was my original point
5248	1	okay we can blame the american people if youd like but keep in mind that your politicians benefited from american interference just as much as american politicians did and you paid them handsomely to sell you out      so if were blaming the american people then we can also point a finger squarely in the face of the brazilian people
5249	1	first of all why do you doubt that im american genuinely curiousthere are also important differences between 19thcentury protectionism and what leftists are proposing in the 21st century first of all natural barriers separated markets to a much greater extent with transportation costs and time especially in the case of the us modern transportation has reduced those barriers secondly the us didnt nationalize any of its industries during that time period so there was still plenty of internal market competitionim not some neoliberal crusader but the entreguismo narrative always seemed really simplistic to me
5250	1	im aware of the distinction and im sure that if i had studied more spaniard spanish or lived in spain it would be perfectly normal but having learned spanish from latin americans and living in chile im sure to spaniards my accent is a bizarre mix of gringo and chilean it just sounds funny like i said ive got no justification it is just how it sounds to me
5251	1	thats a thing
5252	1	that is actually a pretty good term im all in favor of using that more often
5253	1	what do you dislike about him some things hes done seem more for show than practicality such as the idea of him flying commercial security being the largest concern but i dont have a good grasp of his politics or policies
5254	1	how come
5255	1	some people more than others segregate based on race but it also has to do with culture and interests people selfsegregate in society and go where they feel they belong the average black american and white american for example even if they live in the same city and are of the same economic class will probably not have quite the same interests there is a reason certain activities are known as white people things there are things that black people do that white people dont do certain shows and music are favored depending on the group etc someone like taylor swift is not going to be popular amongst middle class or any class really black people as rap music is heavily favored by black people regardless of class though some of the artists black people listen to are not highly known outside of black people it is interesting speaking to someone who is country doesnt have so many newer groups of people and that is probably why it seems like from a latin american perspective americans talk about race too much in america you cant live in an urban area without ever coming into contact with people who dont look like you it is also interesting that you say that you dont really know much about your ancestry because outside of black americans everyone knows their primary ancestry by just looking at their last name if they are white obviously asian people would know where they are from since they have only been here in mass for a few decades as well as africans genealogical records were also probably kept better here than in brasil so that may also be a factorin terms of immigrants as i said before they mainly keep their traditions although foreign language skills tend to fade away after the 2nd generation in some cases 2nd gen children still have foreign accents all immigrants dont necessarily want to become americanized especially those from africa the middle east and south asia is there a similar phenomenon in brasillastly is there not a strong correlation between class and race in brasil im sure that white and asian brasilians are the richest just as white and asian americans are the richest here with asians being the richest group of americans it certainly is the case in many countries not just america
5256	1	if youre from the us why the mx flair

5263	1	how many people have actually been banned from this subreddit out of curiosity
5264	1	fair some places include tip in the price to try to get around people not tipping their servers which im not very familiar with but i thought you were saying something like that but youre absolutely right that this makes waiters salarys less staple and can make it as low as 2 dollars an hour if the state only enforces the federal requirement and doesnt have their own law that raises the salary im using the us department of laborhttpswwwdolgovwhdstatetippedhtm but i could be misreading it  like it gets ridiculous which is also why american waiters check in you sooner and more then european counterparts ive heard its rude to tip there which i dont quite get because its more money because american waiters  need  that tip
5265	1	well in english whats the phonetic difference between sink and think why shouldnt there be a phonetic difference between casa and caza then

5279	1	it makes sense where youre getting at with the european powers that colonized although its pretty shitty that even in africa that mentality exists
5280	1	i dont have a ton of experience dating in latin america but there is definitely a culture of being more protective of women is reputationvirginity than men is so it wouldnt surprise me at all if the guys parents tended to be more permissive

5282	1	my coffee is more milk and chocolate then coffee since i drink mochas but i dont see why thats a gender thing is being able to handle drinks with high alcohol content seen as masculine or a gender thing it is here but i couldnt gauge how much it is for you
5283	1	fact we do imagine youre american virtually no american learns a foreign language to a level of true fluency let alone fluency without an accent so of course were impressed
5284	1	people are referring to the us because norteamericano is often used to refer to us residents since in spanish americano is often taken to refer to the americas as a whole some people think it is confusing or dismissive of others in north or south america for folks from the us to claim this name for themselveshowever as youve seen here norteamericano has the same problem since it still refers to a wider geographical area than the us alone
5285	1	honestly idk how i feel about privatization of space travel but money definitely is an obstacle so i get it plus i know in the usa its hard to justify immediately to taxpayers why its worth funding the scientists in charge of the pluto mission kept insisting pluto should still be a planet and it was almost definitely related to them being worried pluto not being planet would make people not want to fund the project
5286	1	yes youre correct
5287	1	thank you for telling me were going back to the moon im going to live vicariously through those astronauts that touch the moon
5288	1	this seems like a symptom of thinking  in continents  to coin a phrase sure it makes sense to say europe colonized and exploited south america but it doesnt make sense to say switzerland did yet switzerland is as successful per capita as any country you might name and certainly more successful than spain and portugal
5289	1	hey thats me
5290	1	that makes sense i generally give people leeway to use whatever term they want in spanish but if someone says american is the wrong way to refer in english to someone from the us then things get trickieryankeeyanki is a weird one because most of us southerners use it as a pejorative term for people from the northern half of the country id much rather be called estadounidense or gringo than yankee for what it is worth
5291	1	do it or youre a pussy
5292	1	gt i dont have an american citizenship either that is the operative bit keeping you from being fully american in most of our eyes of course we have stupid dumbasses who may say otherwise but for most of us the us is a nation of immigrants and if you ever get citizenship youre one of us too
5293	1	that stinks that they keep to their own sects people should be experiencing different cultures thats how we learn about each other but its cool that people come back to embrace there ancestry im guessing theres never been a conflict with an american living in mexico
5294	1	the question was about race obsession sterilization of women based on their race or ethnicity is motivated by a raced obsessed pseudo science eugenics so that is relevant to the question theres no need for you to say however when i said our countries share this poor track record and for every criticism of canada i included one of the united states and both our countries being terrible at this doesnt negate the other also in america we tend to paint an idea of the french colonists getting along with the indigenous populations so i know the average american doesnt know this and i dont expect the average education in other countries to include the issues of indigenous populations in canada since all of the americas have their own histories with indigenous populations let alone teach about someone elses that isnt even bordering you or potentially isnt in your hemisphere i can only tell you the name of the indigenous people of japan so i thought this thread would be a good opportunity to spread awareness some of issues they face in north america today in a thread about race in north america i know i wouldnt have been as aware of these issues past or present if i hadnt actively looked into chicano movement for california or us racial malpractice or made a point to follow some indigenous news outlets on social media i also just dont understand the first paragraph since my comment literally condemns america for handling of the some of the same issues poorly or further exacerbating them and i said  canada is not unique in having these issues or doing these things also i said that americans dismiss canadian issues because we prefer our joke about a friendly polite neighbor and not a nuanced nation with its own vices  sorry for the length
5295	1	beggars cant be choosers

5299	1	most of us whose families immigrated to the us arent white also forming communities in a different cultural context weve come to form our own identity and our own history within the country i dont blame south americans for not getting it but south americans mexicans and people outside the us should acknowledge the different context and reason for latino identity in the us

5315	1	bolivia i thought we were talking about brazil         and your politicians dont lick american boots they enjoy american money there is a difference         and i know enough about who benefits from industrialization to know that youre either using an american computer or youre using a knockoff of an american computer running american software to access an american website to try to convince people that your dealings with america have been nothing but bad for brazil        good luck chum
5316	1	that is not a very good way to draw regional boundaries whatever you look at  food ethnicity dialect sports etc  there is no good reason to place venezuela with argentina but not with the dominican republic

5318	1	if theyre trying assimilate then they might not but you might see it decreases by generation because of assimilation to the us i kiss american latinas who greet me with it but im not used to it here so it can be awkward because it wont be my first assumption for greeting that said i would probably never greet the average american whose not latino with that or let them greet me that way because were more non contact with greetings so the idea makes me very uncomfortable

5327	1	gt that ny tends to me more distant and individual while other regions are much warmeras an american this is how i see nyc though to be fair i havent been there it may just be a stereotype it definitely varies depending on where you are in the us i also agree about the scale i live in australia now and they feel colder to me than americans maybe just because im a teetotaler though i also hear northern europe can be frosty i imagine it is a matter of how readily people trust you in the us we seem polite and friendly even when we dont trust you which can lead others to think were always superficial when they dont really know us beyond our public personas
5328	1	i know more then a few immigrants and children of immigrants both from latin america and eastern europe who are very hard on immigration and assimilation because of either the idea of they or their family had to do it or could do it so should you and yours or sometimes its an idea that if theyre hard on illegal immigration somehow this will make them more accepted by born and raised white americans which leaves a lot to be desired

5365	1	this
5366	1	ehhhh to an extent
5367	1	también
5368	1	well during the 20th century most spaniards that came to uruguay and argentina as well were from galicia canary islands catalunya and the basque countrygalicia is one of the poorer regions in spain so as a result those immigrants from galicia called gallegos were generally less educated and from a lower socioeconomic class of course it is nothing more than a jokewe dont have a negative perception of europeans we dont have a perception at all only reason someone might care is if theyre traveling there or if theyre seeking to obtain citizenship through ancestrydescent
5369	1	we dont have indigenous people is as they were essentially exterminated 150 years ago europeans are intrinsic to uruguayan culture my guess is that this is why we dont have any perception of them at all were a small country between 2 giants that was founded by immigrants however uruguayans today are somewhat removed from their ancestry people generally do not care at all so there is no real attachment or preconceived notions

5379	1	how many rich black folks do you know in the world do you need to be rich to live well this only happens in uruguay
5380	1	never heard of that
5381	1	because the countries within mercosur do not seem to have interest in keep integrating and of course if argentinaand brazil want to get in they will have to do the sacrifices they are required to do to integrate equallyampx200bthat is why im emphasizing that this current context could be the one to do those reforms that both countries need

5398	1	gt did you read past that you can say things and they can mean a thousand things to you but your personal set of beliefs and morals doesnt change the meaning of the words said they do carry meaning regladless of your intentionsit definitely does not work that way societies are constantly evolving and adapting in order to overcome new issues they face if i were called a homosexual in 2018 pretty much nothing would happen compared to being called a homosexual back in the 1500s when the spanish inquisition was a thing nowadays it is usually considered ok and back then it was sodomy and a sin to be punished forgt you said it yourself black slaves were considered property and they belonged to someone how am i supposed to take that but i get it times change and things dont mean the same they used to plus the spanish language have no other way of calling blacks other than negro or at least a convenient way youre right on thatyes i said black slaves were considered property i dont see many black slaves in venezuela at the moment mostly because people from the bolívar to the monagas period did their best to abolish it however abolished slavery doesnt magically rewrite history and say there wasnt any slavery before so that is how you have to take it society changedgt oh well ive heard it a thousand times claiming ignorance is null it is a popular phrase in our venezuela maybe your particular enviroment dont use it but it is a phrase used by our regular joe we as a society see white as better than brown or blackinstead of improving your race you should improve your social circlegt you are agreeing with me im kind of white too i was pale as fuck now more tanned and ive suffrered all of that you said they discriminated you because of your skin color that is textbook racism and why use reverse racism racism is universal to all its not an exclusive thing to whitesit is widely known that white people cannot be victims of racism most people cannot comprehend the fact that plenty of black people in south africa are antiwhite so reverse racism had to be createdgt you say venezuela is not racist then why this study alongside others have said otherwiselet is take a look at this quote from the archived wikipedia linkgt the only real exceptions were oilrich venezuela where income inequality sometimes breaks along racial linesdude look at petare one of the poorest places of caracas through its history and where many criminals live by whatever reason it is mostly nonwhite people who live there there is a correlation between low incomecrime and not being white as far as i know causality between those variables has not been proved and ironically if there was causality between being nonwhite and poorcriminal it would justify prejudice or discrimination towards petareños

5401	1	work like a negro has historical origins based in slavery black slaves were doing the biggest load of physical work nowadays working like a negro means youre working your ass off and in no ways means any kind of disrespectdont be an indian also has historical origins since most venezuelan natives had little to no technology compared to european settlers and nowadays it is used in the same context if you dont know how to use some basic technology you will be told thatthese expressions in the present mean little to no disrespect towards indigenous or black people theyre just good at portraying the ideas being communicatedmy grandparents were white europeans that immigrated to venezuela in the 40s and by extention im also white it didnt stop many people such as my teachers friends or family calling me mi negro which is a way to express affection based on the idea that back then black slaves were considered property and they belonged to someone it means that i belong to themtheir hearts it would be very stupid of me to be offended by it as i see nothing wrong with being black and im able to understand the underlying meaning of it

5405	1	gt from the perspective of institutions yes without a doubt the system of encomienda and haciendas from imperial spain was grained into the colonies especially the places where the systems were the most lucrative such as the carribean and the tropic colonies the colonies all of them were meant to extract resources for the crown so that they could finance their ears with france and brittaingt gt gt gt institutions matter you think there wasnt similiar things in precolumbian america there is a reason why when cortez conquered the capital of the aztec empire most of his forces where composed of other city states because the aztec empire kept fierce control of neighbouring people and they joined forces with the spaniardssimiliar thing happened with the inca empire since the inca empire also conquered neighbouring tribes and peoples so i dont think it would have been so diferentalso at the time most of spanish america gained its independence the spanish empire was already a weak empire and like some mentioned before spain was a poor country until the 60 is or around thatalso in almost all letinamerican countryes there was civil wars and conflicts all around considering the fact that there is already 200 years since the independence of most latinamerican countryes is safe to say that spain doesnt have much blame for the current issues and as mentioned before  that is something repeted by populists to look good i also seem similiar opinion on other countryes that where colonized too that the politicians allways use the former colonizers to hide theyr corruption and incompetence

5413	1	i already saw the conversantion below and i dont see any russian source denying the military bases because the link you posted talks a member of the venezuelan constituent assembly who said something but you can read crystal clear in here that the russians will set up a military base in venezuelahttpwwwngrupolitics201812111_7460_caribyhtmli dont know if you are trying to distort the truth but that is what it looks like when you say something that doesnt reflect in the reality

5423	1	i dont understand why he would deny what is obvious that russia will set up a military base in venezuelai mean we all know that both russia and venezuela are antidemocratic countries doing their best to destroy venezuela in detriment of the us but that is what everyone expects from putin and maduro dont we that is why they should be executed or at least tried for the crimes against humanity theyve committed

5438	1	no he should not be banned because he thinks maduro is god well actually he should be banned because literally all of his comments are entirely made to prop up a reaction just read his most recent comments on this sub nearly all of them have the same format and are more outlandish than the previous one a single comment like that could be passed off as sarcasma joke doing repeteadly is what very much crosses into troll territory
5439	1	it isnt comrad thats just what aboutism mother cuba is flawless
5440	1	yes that what socialism finally means because the power is shifted from a businessman towards a burocrat the system stays the same only that there are no incentives to increase production or develop wealthy for anyone except the corrupt people in powerthe capitalist system that is so overly critiqued by marxists is swiftly replaced by a state capitalism system which is not afraid of using terrorist tactics to maintain itself on power

5456	1	edit haha look at what the wiki of the author of the blog you linked saysgt francisco rodríguez an economist of wesleyan university accused weisbrot of being biased for praising hugo chavez is economic policies and stated that weisbrot is work had a use of heavily slanted dataif you praise hugo chavez economic policies then you are a big giant moron original comment ummmm yes the usa supported the 1950s government of marcos perez jimenez who was hit by a coup in 1958 by the adecosthe adecos were the ones planning the 2002 coup your link has a citation of training which has seen been deleted for being false thats why the link number 1 doesnt workknowing about a coup is not conducting it the venezuelan generals planned the coup after chavez begun changing the textbooks of public schools to show communist apology and making them train with disgusting cuban soldiers lastly the rest of the claims of your post have nothing to do with venezuela and simply state that people working for the bush administration were involved in nicaragua something thats irrelevant to venezuelaand thats not even a news piece thats a blog you are linking an opinionated blog not a news source ps i trust the economists article 10000 times more than an opinionated blog by a huffpost employee which this blog claims its wrong using links that have been since detracted and yes recognition for a government is not helping a coup its showing support for the new government hugo chávez should have never even been elected since he attempted a coup himself which is against the constitution
5457	1	he was saying they should have been thrown out of helicopters and murdered that waythe thing is this actually happened with marcos perez jimenez its just people are too young to remember since mpj was over thrown we have only had socialist governments that was in 1958

5494	1	lmfao
5495	1	venezuelan people were amazed for the achievements of the communist revolution in cuba in the 80s and the 90s so we wanted to follow their example and elected a socialist leader because we wanted to go full communismor because he showed himself as a third way capitalist who always said he wasnt socialist and became popular as an outsider after saying he was going to solve the problem with the traditional 2most popular parties who were government for the last 40 years before chávez is candidacy
5496	1	depends how you use the word esos indios no han reparado la calle is probably offensive indio quieres una birra is probably not

5500	1	because you are claiming chavez mistakes was to not change economic policies from the fourth republic which isnt what caused the crisis so you are wrong
5501	1	gti dont think it is a big deal what is russia going to doi wouldnt mind if the russian were here to oust maduro but they are here to support maduro is dictatorship which is already bad for venezuelansi think all governments in the hemisphere must condenm the military base or any deployment of foreign military force in venezuela intended to support maduro
5502	1	no hugo chavez attempted to overthrow the venezuelan government already and shouldnt have been allowed to run for president the usa had nothing to do with the coup attempt of 2002 so yes the usa shouldnt intervene and they didnt i wish they had because that idiot fucked my country forever
5503	1	that user also believes that chavez isnt responsible for the shitshow and that la 4ta is more responsible for the crisis than chavez
5504	1	knowing about the coup is not helping the coup there was no american aid besides recognition the coup was internally planned by generals and politicians many even close to chavez its all in the articles you linked which do not say the bush administration had anything besides knowledge of it its in the articles and the wikis you linked
5505	1	statistically the number is much lower

5537	1	well i am not from cienfuegos or trinidad i have just visited both so maybe someone who has lived there can tell you about all the stuff you can do from my point of view trinidad is a colonial town with stone roads at the center of the town there are galleries and restaurants all around but that can be said of any place in cuba outside of trinidad there is the valle de los ingenios httpsenwikipediaorgwikivalle_de_los_ingeniosits a nice valley and they have zip line if youre into that i dont know anything else in trinidad i didnt stay overnight so i dont know the night life when i went i just walked around the center of town which is the tourist area for the most part in the heart of trinidad there is a church that you pay to get in and you can climb all the way to the top to where the bells are and you can observer the town from up high in cienfuegos i walked around parque jose marti and paseo el pradohttpswwwtripadvisorcomattraction_reviewg609122d196325reviewsparque_jose_marticienfuegos_cienfuegos_province_cubahtmlthe park is nice and the architecture is not falling apart like in most parts of cubai just like to walk around cienfuegos and see all the beautiful architecture all around and also the streets are cleaner than most areas in cuba it feels like the people there take pride in their city

5569	1	eso es verdad los chivatones del cdr siempre estan activo
5570	1	how do they know it is the same white tourist woman every time though lol
5571	1	that makes a little more sense pizza is from italy so i understand it wouldnt really be looked at as cuban foodi did have pizza in cuba though so i think its worth a shot even just to see how cubans do pizza because in my experience it was different yes pizza is italian but the pizza youll get in cuba is vastly different than pizza youll get in italy or the us and if by hamburger youre referring to hamburguesa that too is different i was expecting a hamburger as i knew it and that isnt what i ended up with hamburgers are different therei dont have any suggestions for restaurants but what we did was instill a rule if there was someone outside a restaurant trying to get us to go in and there were other english speaking white people there we avoided it like the plague not because the food was bad but because we wanted to avoid tourist traps you can find better food for a lower price elsewhere we went to a lot of street food places some were great others not so much but i think those little hole in the wall places are probably where you want to go for an authentic somethingthatmom would make ropa vieja and then sit on the curb and watch people go by we tried to make a plan to visit some of the restaurants we found good reviews for online and while those were fine none of them felt like an authentic cuban experience to us they felt like they were designed to present an authentic cuban experience servers wearing cuban flag dresses etc that covered up an actual cuban experiencegood luck and i apologize if i gave you too much hate
5572	1	whered you dive at and is the rental gear in good shape  i leave in a week and would love to add that to my plans

5577	1	i have no doubt at all that you can find a house partyif you are sociable at all you will not have a problemi would be very surprised if you couldnt find a house party in cuba for new years evelot is of people hang out at the malecon too im sure you can find a group to chill withas for musicit is gotta be nkm right nowel negrito el kokito manu manuthey are the hot shit in cuba right nowother artists are el taiger chulo chacal jacob forever yomil y el dany el kamel srta dayana el micha el pichy harrysonthese are all cuban artists for regular reggaeton look for wisin y yandel ozuna bad bunny anuel maluma prince royce j balvinthat should give you a good collection of popular cubaton and reggaetonit is not really acceptable to play old songs in the caribbean hahaunless it is an absolute classic you could get away with some daddy yankee tego calderon don omarbut if it is 6mths to a year old they will tell you to switch the song lolif you really wanna bribe cubans bring red bullor some kind of liquor you cannot get there like famous whisky or somethingunfortunately i dunno much about other liquor im there for the rum especially santiago de cuba that is the best rum but rum is cheap and plentiful there they will still appreciate a bottle of rum though too no doubtoh and chewing gumthey will go nuts for regular minty chewing gum like excel or dentynehahaalso if you are a single guy definitely find some cuban girls they really go nuts for extranjerosanyways hopefully you have a great time nye ill be in matanzas for nye not havana otherwise id show you aroundampx200b
5578	1	the best machinery for agriculture isnt american made and the cuban government turned down an opportunity for a tractor assembly plant financed by arkansas they get lots of farm machinery from india china korea mexico etcin any case the issue isnt working the land in cuba it is government mismanagement that has systematically destroyed the entire industry since castro took power in my opinion it is the single greatest failure of the revolution
5579	1	which resort you going to
5580	1	mate you are spreading missinformation we have 2 ccy and you choose the one you want to use regardless your nationality some places will take cuban pesos some others not but thats got nothing to do with your place of birthmost cafes in havana are not priced for tourists maybe the ones u visited are idk that couldnt be further from the truth prices in cuba are the same for everyone and you can pay in any ccy you want as long as its accepted by the merchantyou are confused
5581	1	the same that us is doing across the world sniffing in every country do you remember the scandals about the espionage of the us on the allied govs like germany but in the end it was ok for europeans because it was an allied it the same for cuba china and russia are allied but the us arent us had been political enemy since long time ago any country reviews pros and cons and decides if the relationship could harm or not their politica project no relationship is harmless
5582	1	right now authentic food is shitty burgers pizza and spaghetti  that is their reality
5583	1	or you could still call her out though kindlythis is the problem white people always shying away from checking their fellow white people
5584	1	how many hours left you had on each card
5585	1	theres a lot more to it than thatcuba has virtually zero violent crime anywhere in the country there are certain places in the us where violent gang crime afflicts teenagers and young adults with people dying in their teens and 20s it not uncommon in the worst parts of our largest cities that drags down life expectancy quite a bit drugs killing young people is also a problem that cuba doesnt suffer from because any recreational drug besides alcohol and nicotine are virtually impossible to find in cuba the over abundance of food and sugar especially leads to all sorts of diseases in the us like high blood pressure obesity heart attack etc cuba is not afflicted by some of these diseases purely due to a lack of resources
5586	1	im getting back to this comment cuz i think this particular lashing is undeserved for disagreeing politely with you as i told you before i lived in cuba 80 of my existence span and even now that i dont live there i frequently visit it very often  at least once a year regarding the charity im one of those who think that it doesnt matter how its done as long as its an act of good will i dont know who you are or if you are cuban or not  you does not sound like one tho or if you live in the island or whatever but if you have a minuscule idea of how that country works you should know that those entities you mentioned above are in need too thus usually what you donate doesnt end up where it is supposed to if you even know what i meanfor the part of personal fulfillment i once had this argument with you and strictly told you that while i was studying in primary school there were these guysjudging now by their way of speaking maybe australians but who knows who come quite often to my school and give some very small and meaningless gift to students and professors and afterwards they get to spend some time with all us teaching english and so forth i  didnt understand this back then but today i remember the faces of those fellas and i bet they were feeling like if they had reached the sky of happiness and on my end if i ever see them again in my life i wouldnt hesitate and at least buy a beer to them cuz thats the least i can do to someone that made me and my friends felt happy for the short instant they were present in school so i dont know from where your all donations would go thru the indicated channels line comes from i have come to think that you might be in charge of some of those entities tbh cuz u are always bashing every time someone wants to directly donate meaningless things to cubansahhhh i almost forgot i can mention at least 510 close friends wealthy people who go to cuba and donated tons of shirts baseball bats footballs ect and they never did it to one of those entities and never had any single issue with the government
5587	1	lol youre such a dick head httpswwwtravelweeklycomtravelnewsairlinenewspackingpothowriskyisithttpswwwtravelweeklycomtravelnewsairlinenewspackingpothowriskyisit ampx200bdog is dont sniff for potampx200bthis part is somewhat fair illegally smuggle drugs across an international border into a dictatorship with draconian drug laws and no concept of western rule of law can you elaborate on this
5588	1	dont forget to be high when they stop you it will be funny
5589	1	well i mean cuba has huge problems importing equipment to better industrialise farming there does it not
5590	1	good to know thanks
5591	1	google says 235 and i made that trip last week but i guess you know better
5592	1	i am white he is black we are similar in age 2 years difference late 20s i probably look like a tourist i dont get a jinetero vibe at all we were stopped 3 times on the malecon 3 times in trinidad once walking into a nontourist club once in plaza mayor and once walking in the street what i dont understand is why he never gets into any trouble because he has in fact been caught with a tourist before me
5593	1	gtwhat i meant is they tell you the price based on your appearancefrom my experience this only happens when youre with a tour group and often it is a result of the tour group booking the entire restaurant  they charge extra for this but youd get the same in many placesgtand i should bring euro rightbasically anything other than usd  the cuc is pegged to the usd 1 cuc  1 usd however there is a 10 penalty on converting usd so 1 cuc  110 usd if converting usd  euro gbp cad etc are all perfectly fine  dont expect to be able to rely on bank cards or credit cards
5594	1	yup no one at allthis post has a chip on it is shoulder for sure
5595	1	i fly to cuba once a year im not an armchair expert im posting about my own personal experience with the subject
5596	1	and new air conditioning units although i have seen late model bmws and benzos in habanaampx200b
5597	1	im not talking about letting money come in and buy everything where did you get that from and feudalism is basically a system where a god appointed ruler has full control over the lives of their subjects is that way too different to cuba but considering how condescending your post is im going to assume you are a mcdonald is socialist
5598	1	im sorry i meant to say seasoning lol
5599	1	dont even think about it
5600	1	yea of course great idea
5601	1	i dont have to prove anything to an ignorant uninformed person who posts about a subject that they know nothing about you cant name a cuban made export that the embargo affects in any meaningful way not a single onecarry on bye
5602	1	one must become the malecon
5603	1	well i havent thought of that as a possibility
5604	1	did you find that there was a decent amount of stuff to do in cienfuegos vs trinidad
5605	1	i see so they call in my description each time and i match that description each time so that is why he doesnt get into trouble now i understand thank you he said it was his first time with this happening so he couldnt explain it to me
5606	1	and then later you see people passing videos of the incident via zapya
5607	1	til im not the only redditor in town d saludos
5608	1	yeah america is so much worse than cuba in so many ways im surprised immigration isnt the other way around
5609	1	jjjj
5610	1	thanks for the input
5611	1	yes i didnt want to be rude but i was pretty sure that she hasnt had good cuban food before i just wanted to make sure that i wasnt crazy haha
5612	1	camera yi 4k with gimbal
5613	1	both are ok my friend they are widely accepted in many places altho you should always carry some cuc  convertible pesos which the actual rate is 10087cup and some cup  1 cuc  23 cup i know this shit is complicated so in case u need more help dont hesitate and ask
5614	1	thats so sad
5615	1	youre so amazing thank you so much friend
5616	1	honestly good call on your part  didnt realize a black family said that  thats weird considering our food isnt known for being the healthiest  not greasy
5617	1	haha yeah were staying in essentially a bed and breakfast with different families
5618	1	care to elaborate on these complex reasons
5619	1	thank you
5620	1	sure i can rum for example because the embargo is not only product based but based on the principle that any country trading with cuba will not trade with the usa that makes it even more complicatedbut its much better to insult and launch an ad hominem and then run away with some bye when one doesnt have any arguments
5621	1	racism holly shit are you crazy  caribbean food is greasy have you ever eaten a croqueta pfffracism fuck me then have you ever eaten yuca fritavaca fritayuca con mojoropa viejaany empanadasthis fucking people and their racism the get fuck outta hereyes cuban food is greasystick a croquetica up your ass
5622	1	oily and greasy mean the same thing right
5623	1	hello thanks for getting back to me well thats just one of many questions i assume car hire is out if the question so busestaxiswe are still booking itinerary  we are not beachhotel people so staying in casas everywhereaccommodation i am relaxed about it is just safereliable transport and any risk factors for the girlswhere abouts are you
5624	1	youve gone off on a tangent that has very little to do with my one specific reply regarding cuba is agriculture industrythe embargo and it is impact on cuba is very real but in my opinion it is a red herring to try and hold it up as any reason whatsoever why cuba is agriculture industry has been systematically destroyed since the revolution that is on the cuban government periodin any case the embargo is an exceptionally complicated subject that ive been intimately involved with for 25 years and it is not a discussion that i get into deeply on an internet forum anymore it is too much of a pointless exerciseall the best to you and thanks for the polite common sense discourse which is all too uncommon on this subhappy travels
5625	1	thank you i am leaning toward vinales although the salto del caburni is very tempting
5626	1	i actually saw it but since its partially out of view i wasnt completely sure it was another it also seems taller
5627	1	sounds like a great way to be arrested in a country where you dont have an embassy
5628	1	si todo eso significa decir la verdad sobre cuba y exponer la realidad que ustedes los comunista ocultan al mundo y de ustedes mismos pues si soy todo lo que tu quieras menos lo que tu eres además me cago en fidel
5629	1	nice thank you
5630	1	amén
5631	1	bro this guy studied spanish for two years in us high school i think he knows more than you in all seriousness how does vergüenza mean both honor and shame at the same time like what would be a more appropriate equivalent in english  maybe how reputation can imply either good or bad as in youve got quite a reputation
5632	1	maybe she doesnt like those either we have no context of this womans food preferences some people dont like greasy food
5633	1	we had rented a car and drove  so aside from the terrible map we had it wasnt too difficult  we drove in from cienfuegos and took some awesome mountain road to the parking area of the trail head  the hike itself is a little over 2 miles  its an easy hike in my opinion but it gets very slippery towards the water area  we did it in june so the heat was oppressive  took about an hour to get to the falls and a little longer going back upwhere would you be coming from  vinales  that would not be doable for the day  its something like 7 hours away from vinales
5634	1	and having mouth wide open while shouting freeze
5635	1	yeah seems like its not too much of a difference guess 100 seems like the norm thanks for the reply
5636	1	gt ive never seen a single us food product in cuba everything is from cuba or neighboring countries like mexico that is absolutely incorrecthave a read through thishttpsstatic1squarespacecomstatic563a4585e4b00d0211e8dd7et5a1c3828ec212d9bd32b36ac1511798825500economiceyeoncubamonthlynovember2017pdf and google us exports to cuba for many years the us was the 1 foreign supplier of food to cuba cuba is agricultural industry is so fucked up that they import 70 of their food from abroad unbelievable but true
5637	1	what are the other worries if youre driving leave next weekend for my cuba trip
5638	1	gt lmao you think cuban customs is tougher than the usyoure utterly clueless about cuban aduana their enforcement measures and their justice systembut yes i was just kidding ditto umtl_dood go ahead and smuggle illegal drugs into cuba no problemscheers from havana bye
5639	1	all the chicken you buy en la shopping comes straight from the usa also some sweets and cookies as well
5640	1	yikes it might just be the airport i live in tampa so i always fly there and checking just now has flights for next weekend in the upper 300s and spiking at 500 for new years but they drop right back to 250ish mid january if youre from florida it might be worth the drive to tampa instead next time
5641	1	the internet there isnt totally reliable i think its more likely that it was just having issues when you were logging in the cards are all identical and the system doesnt seem sophisticated enough to do what youre describing
5642	1	hey thanks for the mention were glad the service worked well for you
5643	1	in my opinion it is more beautiful than sad sure there is a certain ugliness to the buildings in dire need of maintenance and yes cubans have suffered a lot due to a combination of socialism and the us embargo against them but the beautiful thing is that human life is still largely thriving in cuba despite the difficulties and suffering maybe not thriving in the sense of material wealth but definitely thriving in terms of cultural activity art and people surviving with what they have i feel inspired every time im in cuba by the resilience and creativity of the people
5644	1	well their airbnn services are are granted to nonus persons i am us doesnt appear i can use my us based credit card to book travel from us based on us state dept rules for us citizens traveling in cuba
5645	1	trinidad is also very touristy i assume you got lucky not that the town or its people are any less beautiful because of it
5646	1	they also downsized to an rj on ewrhav so going out on a limb here the route isnt as profitable as they hoped so theyve downsized and raised the prices to see if it becomes viable before cancelling it outrightampx200b
5647	1	in a horse carriage maybe
5648	1	how does the embargo force cuban government officials to live in mansions lol
5649	1	my point is im not sure how interested people are down there bout music  really  youve been to cuba right  this wont be our first trip to cuba only to this area
5650	1	the reason cubans flu with that company  didnt you read the article  the charter company offered attractive deals on bulk baggage gulfstream allows passengers to bring along a 20pound carryon bag for free and that the first 45 pounds of checked luggage are also complimentary any additional weight is charged at a rate of 1 per pound for up to 70 pounds he said while other airlines charge double thats enough reason
5651	1	tienes razón
5652	1	i did a trial booking    got to the page that requests my category of travel then enter physical address and greet our host and it went to my credit card info yeah thanks for your suggestion
5653	1	cuban food tends to be rather bland compared with any other latin american cuisine

5658	1	what does income tax have to do with freedom to travel those concepts are not related a tax on income can be levied in spite of any other restrictions when you say the deal may require taxrelease fee is that just pure speculation or has that actually been discussed
5659	1	gt cuban food is different than most latin american countries because they cant trade with the ushuh the us is a huge exporter of food to cuba and that has been the case the ages
5660	1	i totally agree less expensive is a better choice of words about the quality yeah i know it will probably suckfor a while data will be a luxury like having a cell phone was years ago but today there are 5 millions mobile lines despite everything i only hope that it will become more accessible over time

5669	1	thank you
5670	1	your argument is a logical fallacy there are lots of problems for sure but those problem would still exist even if they hadnt implemented this new internet service the existence or nonexistence of 3g internet has no impact on availability of water or medications

5680	1	i think it is only available in canada there may be an equivalent in the us you would have to ask your doctor if they know of one and can prescribe
5681	1	gt but its much better to insult and launch an ad hominem and then run away with some bye when one doesnt have any argumentsstop being such a crybaby your rude prove your argument or gtfo reply deserved nothing moreas for your rum example youre wrong on all accounts 1 cuban rum is available in over 120 counties around the world 2 your belief that any country trading with cuba will not trade with the usa is also 100 incorrect and quite frankly demonstrates a remarkably uninformed and confused misconception about what the embargo even means
5682	1	gt not true at all otherwise the american market wouldnt itself be flooded with foreign brandsit was my understanding though that the embargo is a little more insidious than it appears on the surface ships servicing cuba are or at least were prohibited to port in the us for a period after landing in cuban ports this and other measures taken with the embargo means or meant that prices that cuba paid were artificially inflated to offset costs usually incurred by servicing cuban ports this as well as having to purchase any and all us made goods through third party vendors at increased costs prohibits industrialisation further the embargo also restricts or restricted importation of things like fertiliser and fuel which i imagine hampers the industry a lot toogt if by some scale you mean utter devastation of a vibrant industry then yes how ridiculous is it that cuba imports sugar and rice it is insane mismanagementgenuine question because i dont know but how vibrant was the farming industry prerevolution i know it went through a boom during soviet years with the whole 10 million ton year and its failure but still with record exports and collapsed dreadfully after the ussr fell it is ridiculous that rice and especially sugar is imported definitely but how much can it be blamed on government mismanagement and how much can be blamed on the fall of the ussr or does that fall into the same category

5695	1	thank you for the detailed response i wasnt trying to attack cuban food i just never felt that pizza or pasta was a good representation of cuban foodim not trying to seek pleasure in cuban food just trying to find something authentic it is not like i think any of the food ive had is terrible it is just not what i expected from cuba

5705	1	what is fula
5706	1	i read it but it doesnt make sense im pretty sure if you have the american airlines credit card you get the same allowances for baggage one free carry on and one free checked bag and if you have status on american you can take more bags i can check 3x 70lbs bags for free if you need to take a lot of weight your best best is to pay for a first class ticket down to cuba it will end up costing less than paying 1lb on a charter the cost difference between economy and first class is like 150 extra and it allows you to take 210 lbs of checked luggage again makes no sense to me to fly a charter they are clearly marketing themselves as a good alternative to people who have zero travel experience anyone who flies regularly will realize its not a better deal
5707	1	youre coming from canada you have more to fear there than cuba
5708	1	can you send me the information id lile to see it as i am building something similar
5709	1	so 1 more question should i bring us dollars or euros
5710	1	this is the not same as income tax because the players and any other profession dont have the freedom to go to other countries as they please also the deal may require tax as well as a release fee which seems arbitrary
5711	1	id spend one day in havana for a first timer its the essence picture perfect location salsa mojito sunset at the malecon to me cuba is that place for a first time visit
5712	1	flying on american airlines ill check out their website for some more info thanks
5713	1	thanks thats all i need
5714	1	and a concentration camp
5715	1	thanks for your input we havent been to cuba before so exploring in many areas is desirable but not always feasible since we are oldwe havent developed a budget yet not knowing our housing costs but that appears to be reasonabledefinitely well be doing the horseback riding in vinales we can cover a great deal of territory that we couldnt do by hiking
5716	1	de nada jaja
5717	1	i definitely wouldnt say bland it is very flavorful it is just not spicy as in hot having grown up in a diverse latino community ive eaten a lot of good authentic latino food and i personally find it more flavorful than some other latino cuisines that rely mainly on heat heat  flavor
5718	1	also have you been to cuba
5719	1	por tu propia admisión es una definición arcaica pero definición al finel parche en cuestión fue usado por la brigada de cubanos que participaron en la invasión de bahía de cochinos una partida de viejos nostálgicos usando la imagen de los mambises que lucharon a finales del siglo 19 quieres mas arcaico que esotiene sentido que hayan usado verguenza como honor pundonor u orgullo y no como pena por haber sido derrotados como los mambises no crees
5720	1	i am not sure of the exact locations first day we dove with shark is friends near playa la bonita the next video yet to be posted is around a shipwreck and at the bottom is where the shark feeding takes place i brought my own wetsuit mask amp tube fins but rented the bcd regulator and tank if you have zero gear they have everything available for rental from what i saw and used it seems in good condition however i would consider buying my own regulator next time it is more of hygiene preference
5721	1	yeah giving control of your telecommunications infrastructure to a shady company from a country with an ongoing embargo against you why would they possibly say no to that
5722	1	merci
5723	1	ehh i dont mind spending a little money for it the best vpns you have to pay for anyway how fast is the internet in cuba does it depend on what part of the country youre in i was also just reading that i should be careful when im using a hotspot and going on websites that are blocked in cuba even with a vpn i just want this for my phone
5724	1	yes i was very cautious of the cuc and cup differences i even made sure to google different pics before i left so i would be familiar which turned out to be unnecessary ha i was curious though what is in it for them why can they give a better rate and what do they do with the usd
5725	1	oh god no way lol that guy must be a legend
5726	1	cuba doesnt want gulfstream to fly anyone either the bribe didnt get though or someone bribed more
5727	1	again what difference does it make to you that airbnb has permission to rent casas to other nationalities youre amercian airbnb has always worked in cuba for you the fact that theyre also renting to people in other countries has nothing to do with yousorry i cant explain it any better just do a trial booking and see what happens that will prove it is no big deal and youre making this way more complicated than it ishappy travels
5728	1	ill be going from varadero which makes it a bit tricky let me drop you a pm

5736	1	google offered project loon back when it was starting and they rejected it they offered to connect the island for free before the cable from venezuela came in place they just dont want to risk losing the control that is why things have moved so slowly now they completely rely on chinese hardware for the cell network infrastructure let is see how things move on from now own but according to my previous experience with etecsait is going to suck
5737	1	i dont disagree at all i would argue its largely to due with the embargo and such and what theyve accomplished in the face of everything and being largely alone is the great achievements simply wanted to bring the herald into question tho due to its biases in general
5738	1	another idiotic piece of shit communist talking bullshit in this subreddit vete a cagar mijo

5741	1	yup  no prob
5742	1	lmfao
5743	1	well  given that american credit cards can not be used in cuba  there is a chance that a traveler from usa would leave them at home   also post below says that cash is accepted  this is not the case
5744	1	they have to do that once they can rid of the embargo all cubans can live free
5745	1	i guess im just annoyed i know im no argument champion
5746	1	yes thats unconditional love and it is beautiful indeed
5747	1	come on cuba couldnt accept google is offer for an obvious reason you cant put your entire communication infrastructure in the hands of a company that is submitted to the laws of your greater enemy that wants to destroy you eeuu im tired of hearing the google is offer argument its dumbgtbut the goverment is not interested in giving access to everybodydo you have information of any instance where someone couldnt access internet because of the government wouldnt allow i mean to my knowledge since the wifi internet started everybody have had access
5748	1	solo lanzas ofensas al aire te dolió lo que te dije yo lo sé para información tuya vivo en cuba y desde aquí denuncio al mundo la gran mentira que es el comunismo revolucionario inventado por fidel y secundado x cobardes y aprovechadores como tú que hablan de revolución desde la comodidad del capitalismo pena debería darte por eso yo soy más cubano que tu y además soy mejor que tú

5756	1	it is honestly really hard to say cienfuegos is a lot less touristy it is small but has a really special energy you could do the whole city in one day which is what we did then went to a beach the day aftertrinidad is also really small a lot more tourists and attractions it is a really old city and there is a cool nightlife scene there there is a club inside of a cave so it really depends on what youre looking for i honestly cant pick a favorite because i liked them for very different reasons
5757	1	yes could receive calls and text didnt make any outgoing though
5758	1	naguito tu vives en cuba siempre tenemos opciones no podemos cegarnos en la vida cuando un ser humano decide vivir en cuba esa persona está tomando una decisión de vivir en una sociedad completamente loca elella tiene que asimilar que va a ganar 50 mensuales y que va a recibir un lada de gratis la gasolina subsidiada en realidad todo el costo de vida subsidiado es todo una forma de pago también toda esta teoría se fue a la mierda con el periodo especial

5770	1	you replied to me instead of the oper thanksgood plan though
5771	1	thats what i used on my trip to cuba and it worked great
5772	1	we are definitely going to havana for a couple of days
5773	1	yes their service has been extended to other nationalities but youre i assume american so what does that have to do with you
5774	1	yo usaba reddit desde que estaba en cuba pero no recuerdo cómo fue que lo descubrí es que aquí hay muy pocas cosas atractivas para la mayoría de los cubanos en cada lugar que entro lleno de cubanos es el mismo queso viejo buscando jevitas y más nada aquí habría que invitar gente a las comunidades y enseñarles a discutir las cosas civilizadamente y sin que anden soltando pgas cada dos oraciones
5775	1	gt the embargo forces the government to act like that act like whatyoure making zero sense
5776	1	thanks ok i will carry some euros and some cuc and cup aswell is there some place i should visit apart from havana  and maybe you can suggest best place to buy rum and cigars as a gift maybe there is some kind of a best cigarampx200band also  should i leave tip for room service at the hotels if so  how much

5783	1	pero suele suceder que este subreddit es acerca de cuba esta pinga no es tripadvisor hay mas americanos porque simplemente nadie sabe de reddit en cuba nosotros deberiamos promover este espacio como un foro para la una discusion imparcial de todo lo que tenga que ver con el pais no una coleccion de fotos de cuba tomadas por extanjeros
5784	1	there is no tsa in cuba
5785	1	we had one on the roof but it was more like a regular chain link fence with a chain link roof i guess any way it was for hanging up clothes to dry and not having it stolen
5786	1	there is zero info in your original post that links to the apptool that youre referring to that means your post is effectively meaningless spam and that is why many of your other posts are being deleted

5800	1	first they dont need the florida is cable to enhance the use of internet in cuba even the venezuelan cable is not used 100 the main problem in infrastructure in cuba is the last mile to the phone and the 3g on the cell towers not the submarine cable just a you need to contract a determinate bandwith and my friend told me the contracted bw is enought and good by now and the main company supplying hardware in cuba is huawei one of the biggest companies in the world with some of the actual best hardware the main idea to reject by now the us companies deals is the possibility of recopilation of info espionage in the cuban gov personal or companies in fact info always floods a lot in and out cuba do you really think cubans are isolated of the world
5801	1	and in all that time youve heard vergüenza mean honor how many times exactly 0 which is why you had to cherry pick an archaic definition from a castilian dictionary próximo
5802	1	must be sad being you prolly un hablador de mierda desde el inodoro donde vive en el culo del mundo ahi es donde tu eres guapa usted debe haber cogio una cantidad de huevazos de pinga en cuba por tarru
5803	1	this guy jajajaja yeah right now tell me how arepas are the best food in the world fml
5804	1	gtthe main idea to reject by now the us companies deals is the possibility of recopilation of info espionage in the cuban gov personal or companieslol what do think china is doing why do you think that the us congress blocked huawei from providing hardware for atampt is upcoming 5g network
5805	1	ill try my best i was born in cuba and lived there until the age of 13 because we are treated like lower class in our own country we have this vision of tourists as instantly superior people there were also a lot of benefits of being a foreigner in cuba during the 1980s they had access to hotels better restaurants shops where you can buy things in dollars a lot of privileges just because you had a different passport image what this does to the psyche of our own people there is a pepito joke about thissomething about what you want to be when you grow uppepito answers tourist essentially your friend is with you because you are not cuban as long as you know what you are working with and you dont get emotionally attached youll be fine have a good time just dont bring anything back to the us
5806	1	ive only used the wifi internet you can connect to in dedicated spots in some cities and is pretty fast i havent been in cuba after they activated the 3g network so i have no idea how fast it is
5807	1	ohh yes almost how like noise cancelling headphones workthanks it sends out a certain frequency to essentially nullify any listening devices or something good theory
5808	1	welcome to cuba it is a crazy island
5809	1	that is what i was thinking but wasnt too sure thanks for the input
5810	1	yes basically you can blame the embargo for that if you cannot export how the hell are you gonna make money
5811	1	esto aquí
5812	1	i really appreciate the time you spent typing all this out it is extremely helpful
5813	1	just a minute too late i just messaged others with the info otherwise i would of donated the time to cuba libro thanks for letting me know either way ill be donating some cash to their cause

5817	1	mira venezuela que bien esta comunismo es lo mejor que se invento en este mundo
5818	1	gt if its international then i should keep my mouth shutim assuming the oper is a foreigner yesand your mother is confirming exactly what i posted it is not common for even the cuban government tour agencies to very often get deals that are better than the very expensive walkin rack rates
5819	1	i dont think one can honestly say it is beautiful it is beautiful because of the historical and cultural significance behind it but objectively really not beautifulthese buildings just like the buildings in the old center are in dire need of restoration and maintenance
5820	1	thats what i thought but we tried our hotel cards in a park which had wifi and it didnt work your saying youre not sure  im telling you from my experience that it didnt work i dont have anything else to add just trying to let people know what to expect
5821	1	i meant that regarding random places to eat you might find in havana not much regulation there
5822	1	interesting perspective i didnt really notice that cuban food was especially greasy but you seem like youd know better than i would i need to eat more of it for sure
5823	1	muchos tienen acceso limitado al internet y aún menos se usa reddit
5824	1	theyre an excellent source for baseline prices you can usually book them via the internet from cuba for much less than the walkup rate is there are exceptions of course
5825	1	the point of the police though is to see if he does this regularly if he makes a living off off hopping from tourist to tourist it is possible he isnt telling me everything but i think the police wouldve had an issue with him by now if that were the case
5826	1	can you get in the usa
5827	1	im white but my girlfriend is mother is black i might politely say something in the future but there is no way i was going to whitesplain racism to my girlfriend is mother the first time i met her i do agree with your sentiment though

5830	1	gt the best machinery for agriculture isnt american made and the cuban government turned down an opportunity for a tractor assembly plant financed by arkansas they get lots of farm machinery from india china korea mexico etcthe best may not be american but surely it would work out cheapest to import from there if they were allowed  whereas importation from a lot of those other countries on any meaningful scale would be a lot more cost prohibitive noi agree that there seems to be government mismanagement on some scale anytime ive driven through the countryside its quite shocking to see just how much empty land is just there going to waste
5831	1	to meet girls im travelling alone and i only speak french and english will that help
5832	1	httpsyoutubehotmbvlfw4k
5833	1	ahh makes sense i asked him several times why he wanted usd and he wouldnt tell me and just laughed so i left it at that lol
5834	1	hahaha exactly like i saw massive caravans of people leaving cuba to go to us sure
5835	1	if she wasnt my future mother in law i would have called her out for sure i definitely got that vibe
5836	1	i was hoping they were trolling but judging by their posting history im afraid they might actually believe what they post hope im wronghappy holidays to you
5837	1	yeah it is exactly the same as other wifi cards we even went to the etecsa in havanna and they told us that it is _probably_ only usable in the hotel i bought it at
5838	1	gtll this be available to touristsyes
5839	1	gt where are all those admirers of cuban tourism propaganda who have been flourishing here latelyi think youre confused what do tourists have to do with anythingit is the legion of wannabe communist supporters  most of whom have never even been to cuba  who are constantly pushing the in my opinion ridiculous political agendas here
5840	1	hi umostmicrobe well do bottled water ourselves and our son is exclusively on breast milk we are from canada it seems there are lots of canadian tourists that go to cuba and places with worse water like mexico with young children ill do more research but everything ive read has said it is a great place to take children because it is so safe and family friendly thoughts
5841	1	yeah it is a drag it was one emergency backup option that worked very well for repeat american visitors
5842	1	not the same thing the japanese release fee has to do with the agreements that the players signed with the japanese club not the government those players willingly entered into the club contract which is different from being tied to your government without your consent it is just like if a player signs a 100m contract with the yankees he cant just walk away from it and play for red sox if the contract is still up that is totally different from having to pay your government a fee for the right to play baseball elsewhere
5843	1	eso mismo espornosi
5844	1	i dont suppose asking if he is a jinetero is a good way to find out if he is one i thought i was pretty good at spotting them and he would even point them out to me on the malecon how can i know if someone is a jinetero what are the characteristics
5845	1	there arent any videos of this song with english captions im afraid most of the message would be lost in translation
5846	1	este subreddit se ha convertido últimamente en un centro de intento de promoción para el turismo en cuba solo los que insisten en ignorar la dictadura en la isla se regocijan con semejantes estupideces como si la miseria humana que impera allí se puede cubrir con un paisaje de varadero o un vídeo propagandístico que no le toca a los de a pie que viven en ese infortunio
5847	1	it is best to book an apartment through airbnb and of you are not on wifi there are lots of people offering a room in their house of course you can also stay in a hotelin havana youll enjoy just walking around and watch all those old cars and other thingsid recommend getting a tour in the tobacco factory or looking into the museum of the revolutionif you dont mind driving a few hours in an old taxi check out trinidad which is a very nice city check out the bell tower of trinidadif you like nature youll enjoy the waterfall el nicho not only that youll see some nice waterfalls but also a nice view of the nature below from the highest point there is a very good small restaurant nearby which looks like a farmand if you want to find more places to visit while youre already on cuba i suggest buying an internet card
5848	1	tu piensas que es gratis es tu opinión te voy a poner un ejemplo con honduras que es considerado el país mas pobre de américa latina el costo promedio de una carrera de medicina de 7 años en honduras es aproximadamente 30000 a 40000 dólares un médico en honduras acabado de graduar gana 900 dólares al mes un médico interno en honduras gana 3000 dólares mensuales 36000 dólares al año el médico cubano hace el mismo trabajo que el de honduras pero solo gana 50 dólares al mes y es lo que va a ganar hasta que se retire 600 dólares al año ahora suponiendo que el médico cubano se gradúa en una especialidad a los 27 años y se retira a los 67 40 años a 600 dólares son 24000 dólares el salario de toda una vida de un médico cubano es menos que lo que gana un medico interno en honduras en un año y tu todavía dices que estudiar en cuba es gratisa nadie le ponen una pistola en la cabeza para vivir en cuba este si es un argumento con lógica
5849	1	yes it means with the pride in this contextthere is a passage in cuban history in which ignacio agramonte one of the main cuban patriots back in 1800 is was questioned about how he thought he would go to war with so few weapons and he said with the pride of all cubansso i can guess the one in the picture is ignacio agramontes
5850	1	gotcha thank you
5851	1	also i cant live without memes
5852	1	lmao dudes mad because he thinks this sub is filled with american tourists and cuban americans just posting pics and asking tourist questions and he thinks this sub should be for actual cubans to discuss issues and connect etc etc but what he doesnt seem to understand is in cuba internet is a relatively new thing its expensive so many especially the rural areas cant access it and cubans probably dont know about reddit cuba is stuck in time so they arent really hip to the new shit
5853	1	cubans want the usds for trips abroad and to squirrel away their rainy day savings which they dont want to be in cuc or cup thus theyre happy to beat the official bank rate of 100 usd87 cuc
5854	1	tenía que ser el pinareño jajaja
5855	1	no this is a great comment thank you i was thinking the malecon or going slightly outside of havana for a beach though i do need to get back to havana on nydif i can find a house party or something id be more than happy to bring rum with me  fingers crossed ill find somethinglet me know some good reggaeton to load my phone up with new stuff classics i dont know enough about reggaeton to know what is good
5856	1	buddy youre hilariousyes the embargo forces cuban officials to be entitled assholesjeeeeezus
5857	1	lol yeah i absolutely agree with you theyve been falling apart since around the 20s give or take and thats indeed sad however its beauty has less to do with history or culture for meits more a matter of pure nostalgia since im a born and raised cuban boy so in an inexplicable way its always beautiful to me and seeing somebody else enjoying the view reminded me of home i guess
5858	1	yes exactly you worded that perfectly and with less effort props lol
5859	1	that does not sound like a good idea i would be insulted if someone brought me their used stuff as a giftmy suggestion would be only bring new stuff as gifts but if you have open bottles at home that you do not want to throw away bring them with you and pretend you are using them during your stay if you do not take open bottles back with you when you leave noone will think twice about it because most people leave things like that behind when returning from their holiday for a number of reasons they can then decide for themselves what to do with it
5860	1	it is indeed as for what you could have done probably not much however it is indeed quite unnerving that a pederast would expose himself like that on broad daylight so there is probably more than meets the eye
5861	1	i love you
5862	1	i think cuba is an increadibly safe country and the water there isnt as bad as other countries i personally didnt have a problem consuming tap water when mixed with other things like smothies in restaurants or for brushing my teeth but then again im from another caribbean island so im more used to the bacteriai did however somehow get sick while i was in cuba i imagine it was something i ate im very careless and eat anywhere if im honest i didnt imagine your infant only fed on breast milk in that case i dont think there is much risk i guess the only thing i can say is watch out if you order things like smothies or any other drink that needs water since theyll probably use tap water in local restaurants i hope you have a great trip
5863	1	would love to i want to visit havana trinidad and viñales one week is not enough time to explore this beautiful country
5864	1	pero ese no és el cliente que etecsa quiere ellos quieren que los cubanos que viven fuera del país paguen por ese costo porque en realidad es un descuento para los que ahora pagan 1 por minuto cuba  el país más caro para comunicarse del mundo siempre se meten un tiro en el pie hermano
5865	1	i selected educational experiences on the airplane ticket i figured id just save a bunch of receipts from museums or hire a guide for a day or something most people like you say that they dont ask ive heard of one person who was asked but he didnt get in trouble anyways i just want to relax goddamnit
5866	1	prove your argument or gtfo
5867	1	funny how you didnt dispute the fact that you have fidel is necrotic member stuff in your mouth
5868	1	gt but im already bought euros euros are perfect never bring us dollars unless it is your home currency the usd gets hit with an extra 10 surcharge that no other foreign currency faces thus making it a bad choicegt as i understood i can freely pay in euros in most places rightno that is bad advice too always exchange into cuccup for local transactions and for your short stay  and especially being based in varadero  forget about cup entirely and only exchange your eur into cuc as required
5869	1	im thinking of two days and one day in either trinidad and cienfuegos which one did you personally prefer
5870	1	google also says 220 to varadero so there is that
5871	1	i know cubans with tens upon thousands of usds hidden away waiting for that day
5872	1	theres a few of us in manchester mate haha cheers man
5873	1	its not a different ccy for tourists  you can use the ccy of your choice some places accept both some others only accept cuban pesos wether you are cuban or not
5874	1	will do thank you i know it was a beast of a post with no research on my end so thanks for taking the time
5875	1	y por eso escribes todo esto y defiendes al comunismo genocida que gobierna este país tu solo quieres sobrevivir y no decir lo que en verdad sientes para que no te señalen en el cdr o el trabajo o a lo mejor para seguir entrando a cuba y gozar de que vienes con pacotilla para tu familia eso lo entiendo pero no dejas de ser un cobarde usted es un penco comunista
5876	1	i honestly think it is russia
5877	1	also the head of the comandos mambises was codenamed ignacio
5878	1	theres great restaurants in cuba but traditional cuban food is beans and rice chicken fricase ropa vieja etc the cuban sandwich is a miami invention and you dont see mojo all over the place either just imagine you are in any other big city and go to the best rated restaurants  also look at foreign recommends when locals recommend a place they are usually understandably on the take
5879	1	you know i usually disagree with you on this matter since ive noticed this gestures always is a winwin on both ends giver and receiver especially when they are kids in need but i also agree that doing so thru the proper channels is fulfilling altho not as much as when its done peer to peer
5880	1	thank you
5881	1	gt once they can rid of the embargo all cubans can live free how in the world do you equate dropping the embargo with a total reform of the entire cuban government
5882	1	cubans in general are very warm people and if you speak english its a plus but if you speak french oplala you just double your chance on meeting more girls hope you have a grand time and please post back your experience once your back home    stay safe and bon voyage
5883	1	the mlb does it with the japaneses too
5884	1	oh venezuela esos si se libraron del dominio del imperialismo llevan desde unos anos haciendo una dieta super fitness a base de keto viva letrinoamerica con chavez y masburro
5885	1	pues yo primero soy cubano y primero que todo está mi libertad y la de todos mis hermanos primero están todos los derechos que está tiranía impuesta por tu adorado dictador trata de menospreciar si tienes razón tu fidel sigue dando palo porque todavía cargamos con toda la mierda que impuso y con todos los que lo siguieron y se beneficiaron todavía la imagen de ese estupido aprovechador su estigma sigue entre los cubanos pero esto que llaman bueno ya no saben ni como llamarle ya no se sostiene y va a caer x su propio pesoademás me cago en raúl
5886	1	thank you that is what he told me also haha he is a musician so he works sporadically he doesnt have a lot of money or nice things broken phone no tv only a couple pieces of clothes all he talks about is music he says he is a good boy and i am music
5887	1	if thats not a problem for you then yes carry some euros and dollars so you exchange them whenever u feel the need for it dont carry much with you on a daily basis just take what u are planning to spend cuba is a very safe place but you never know regarding other places if you meant by that another city tourist very often visit varadero or the keys but this is further which are one of the best spots for the white sand and clean water trinidad is one of the oldest cities in the center of the country with lot of history and vernacular architecture and finally pinar del rio the most westerner city i dont know if i said this correctly full of green and beautiful landscapes imho best cigars of the country are produced there and they are super cheap but it all depends on your schedule and how much time you gonna be in the country  rum well prices dont vary much tbh any store around the city or cafeteria should have the bottle for the same price  they should never be more expensive than 10 depending on the rum of your choice cigars thats more complicated cuz usually you find the best in the streets but ofc in the officially habano stores are awesome too but prices are criminally high for cubans tourist find them cheap if you happen to go visit pinar del rio you might find very good cigars for a dirt cheap price lets do this once you are in havana hit me up here and ill arrange quality cigars for you for a modest price or at least ill try   tips thats always a kind gesture but keep it always within your possibilities and the treatment you get again if you have more questions just ask there are couple of fellows in this forum very helpful i hope it helps enjoy amigo
5888	1	lmao apparently being born in cuba and living there for 35 years and going to college there for 5 years at a pedagogical institute doesnt qualify me as a spanish speakeryou learn something every day
5889	1	gt the best may not be american but surely it would work out cheapest to import from therenot true at all otherwise the american market wouldnt itself be flooded with foreign brandsgt i agree that there seems to be government mismanagement on some scaleif by some scale you mean utter devastation of a vibrant industry then yes how ridiculous is it that cuba not only cant come remotely close to feeding itself but that it now imports sugar and rice it is insane mismanagement
5890	1	thanks so much for your suggestion
5891	1	this area is full of casa particulares   could be a rental
5892	1	it forces them alone to live in mansions
5893	1	gt i am white he is blackgt i probably look like a touristso your question has been answeredgt what i dont understand is why he never gets into any trouble because he has in fact been caught with a tourist before methey called in his id and he obviously doesnt have a bad history of hanging out with multiple young foreign white tourist women
5894	1	de pinga asere
5895	1	its not an american sub so no they arent
5896	1	funny enough that migrant caravan heading to the us came from another country the us just couldnt help throwing a coup in its almost like these problems are caused by the us themselves
5897	1	thanks i like that itinerary i might try to do that myself
5898	1	that is bullshit the family of a cuban doctor cant afford to fly back to brazil every 3 months even an american family with good income cant afford that
5899	1	our ghettoized culture  its amazing
5900	1	of course not but the state doesnt want people abandoning their school children can lose 3 years from school or their jobs to remain too much time outside the country if they will come back
5901	1	thanks yes that is the plan but i thought i would ask here anyway
5902	1	thats what confused me always thought verguenza just meant shame but that didnt make sense  thanks for clearing that up
5903	1	wait have you been to cuba
5904	1	yea thats such a good idea
5905	1	we know it wont pay off though
5906	1	awesome  would love to see it
5907	1	i laugh at the word independent but you are right there is some censorship that is easily avoidedin my case im more concerned about the sites and services i cant access because of the embargo
5908	1	does he have a job does he make money from that job does the money he make from the job actually fit with the kind of expenses you see him having if he says he is a bread baker salary 20cuc per month but he has an iphone and fancy jeans and a flat screen tv at home chances are he actually does other work to earn actual money if he is available to spend time walking around havana with you during the day then he is obviously not doing other work anybody who i know in cuba who earns legit money from non hustler jobs actually spends all day working those non hustler jobs it can be tending to a rental property working in a paladar or driving a taxi none of them have much free time because they are all working their hard money jobs usually these workers also have state jobs to supplement their salary and to ensure they get a pension once they retireanybody who has money and spends the day walking around outside is usually a jineteroa because walking around and meeting touristbeing friendly is the job
5909	1	yeah but theyre like 500 to 600 usd now there used to be plenty of flights in the 200 to 300 range
5910	1	i see 4  one more on the top left corner
5911	1	you should know that united is hardly ever cheaper
5912	1	dude chill
5913	1	go onto airbnb and doing a trial booking youll see it is no issue other websites might not work i dont know
5914	1	oh cmon where the hell would they have touted those great achievements in this article i agree that the herald often pushes cartoonishly anticuban articles that pander directly to the cuban exiles in miami but like objectively cuba is a rough country to live in dont get me wrong i have a lot of family there and i love it to death but the majority of the people i know there would rather leave no social or healthoutcome stats make up for that sure this article spelled out the problem with a marketoriented lens or whatever but the country isnt really working if almost everyone is outlook is bleak  so criticism seems appropriate and this one seemed relatively well balanced
5915	1	im ok with having commonmisspellingbot but comeonmisspellingbot is just annoying look at this threadhttpswwwredditcomrcubacommentsa39od1cuba_is_launching_full_internet_access_on_mobileeb5fbss the bots are what talking to eachother wtf
5916	1	for jineteras language is immaterial for normal girls you need spanish there are rare exceptions
5917	1	im canadian so we do have an embassy canada and cuba have had quite close relations even though all the bullshit with the states fidel castro and pierre trudeau  a legendary canadian prime minister were good buddies and canada helped the us re establish relations with cuba so we do have an embassy in havana and consulates over all the country vice versa with cuba
5918	1	you know full well that they try to spin it that way most of the time  at the end of the day depends on which cop you get the average one wont care too much as long as you are not an obvious hooker though there are some hardcore ones out there good luck convincing them otherwise
5919	1	relentless shit poster matei gave you my opinion and the ugly truth about were u are heading to you cant say right into my face that im wrong when i said jibacoa isnt the easiest place to find musicians andor cultural centers to donate your instruments altho of course you can find themi can put u in contact with some friends  musicians in havana if you really want to but then i dont think your instruments are gonna end up in jibacoa to be filthy honest with ui dont know if you ever heard of the bands nube roja or kilometro 0 prolly not they are young but raising like smoke and they are close to me if you really want some contacts in havana
5920	1	i can tell you that i am 200 sure that not all wifi cards will work just because there is public wifi some are restricted as in the example of buying at the hotels  you can only use at the hotel lobby i experienced that twice downvote if you want but im just telling you how it is i was just there two weeks ago
5921	1	okay well if you have been then i will seriously consider your opinion thank you for your advice
5922	1	dont even think about it
5923	1	forces them to live in big mansions rather than sharing the wealth end the embargo and all cubans will thrive
5924	1	try saying that again without fidel is dick in your mouth youre the one who equated income tax with freedom to travel you tried to make the argument that us income tax is exactly the same as this cuban system where the government gets to decide where you get travel and under what terms also funny that youve found a way to downvote my comments when theyve been turned off in this sub
5925	1	that does look super gorgeous although im leaning toward vinales due to the input of other folks can i ask how difficult it is to get there ie transportationtime wise id be willing to wake up very early to travel
5926	1	gt i would argue its largely to due with the embargoyou think the embargo is responsible for a huge tropical island with a relatively small population not being able to feed itself and therefore importing 70 of its food  much of it from the us
5927	1	then how can you ask if people down there like music
5928	1	lol yea let foreign money come and buy everything and turn it into jamaica you dont know what feudalism is
5929	1	gt you know i usually disagree with you on this matterif you lived here or even visited very often i think youd feel a lot differentlygt doing so thru the proper channels is fulfilling altho not as much as when its done peer to peer your feelings are not what is important here the only issue is dispensing charity in a respectful common sense manner so it is assured of having the most positive impact possible your personal fulfillment is meaningless
5930	1	think about this if he tells you  it happens every time the police see me with a tourist what would you think about his behaivor certainly i believe that if it happened before he will not tell you
5931	1	lmao i wish my man but are you cuban
5932	1	gtthey dont block you from accessing the internet but they block all the sites with news against the govt for example 14ymediocomhttps14ymediocom and independent newspaper founded by yoani sanchez
5933	1	hi there where are you guys staying how will you travel
5934	1	im kind of just hoping that if we stay at airbnb is and take some tours all while keeping receipts then we could maybe check off the educational box the cultural programs seem expensive as fuck and to be honest we prefer to just wander around and do whateverso almost 100 is fine with me too i understand that they just dont want you spending money at pretty much any hotel or restaurant or anything really because youre aiding the communists or whatever it is just driving me crazy because i cant get any straight answers from anything books websites or anywhere i get info but then the next place gives contradicting info or points out that the rules changed argh
5935	1	ive already distributed the wifi cards you can get wifi cards from etecsa for 1 cuc per hour incase you need some
5936	1	getting a little bit of hate which i wasnt quite expecting  so maybe i didnt word my question correctly  i know it is dumb being in cuba in havana and asking where you get cuban food but if you guys came to london and you met me and told me since being in london all youve had is pasta pizza and hamburgers id say oh you havent had any british food then i would consider pizza and pasta to be italian no matter which country you eat them in hamburgers to be north americanim not looking for a gourmet tour of cuba i realise that food isnt exactly plentiful like rum beer and cigars i guess i was looking for something more  i dont know like mum and dad would make obviously i didnt mean to sound as dumb as i did so apologies hopefully this adds context or just makes me look dumber
5937	1	theyre not exactly turning down tourist traffic i think theyre concerned that the ferries would become a lowcost option for cubans in the us to return and flaunt their prosperity
5938	1	thanks for the perspective
5939	1	sorry i forgot to mentioni have not been to that rum shop but i believe it is a havana club storeit is new so i have not been therealso for fishing head down to the bridge way at the other end of townthere are tons of fishermen thereyou can also book charters at the hotel for fishing
5940	1	i did the street exchange several times my first time haha i was suspicious but it worked out and i did get a better deal
5941	1	not outside the tourist centres they dont
5942	1	thank you for clarification ive never been in cuba and all info i got is from googling thanks mate
5943	1	how do i know you are not a troll
5944	1	im not gonna lie its more greasy indeed but i have eaten cuban my whole life and im fit you can always combine it with a lot of salads and fruits we have awesome fresh vegetables all the year but im telling you taste has noooo paragon
5945	1	yeah sorry it is not rampant but the very first time i went back to see my family i was mugged in broad daylight someone also jumped the fence at like 3 am i can only imagine it was to steal unfortunately for him my cousin is dog was faster than he wasedit  grammari wanted to add there is a certain level of safety for foreigners in cuba the majority get treated better than the citizens of the country but i think we all knew that maybe youve never experienced anything like that because youre foreign even if you stay in the city or rent out a home you stick out like a sore thumb im from cuba speak spanishcuban fluently and when i went back people wouldnt stop staring but for your own safety dont wear gold chains or flashy jewelry for example expensive watches or anything that might look to expensive i got mugged over a chain disclaimer this is all based on my personal experience and i am aware a lot of things have changed in cuba but like i said this is what my family and i have experienced
5946	1	have you been to cuba
5947	1	dale un break el mio y quitale el dedo jajaja
5948	1	good to know thanks
5949	1	awesome that is all i needed to hear i dont care as it is fast and i got a good vpn thanks for the help
5950	1	we are given an itinerary and a number of afternoonsevenings we have are free
5951	1	thanks a lot seems like itll be a bit of a pain but ultimately doable
5952	1	looks like you answer your question they are slaves
5953	1	what a rip off
5954	1	httpswwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermfula
5955	1	stonegate has been sold to home bancsharescentennial bank and is no longer offering cuban services to new card applicants
5956	1	well i havent thought of that as a possibility
5957	1	eso dice todo el mundo que no queda otra que vivirlogracias por contestar
5958	1	i didnt experience this at all and definitely bought cards in one city that id use in another city i was also told that there is only one type of wifi card across the entire country
5959	1	jio in india can charge 25 usd per year for 15gb per day of service and theyre making a killer profit  communism was supposed to remove the profit motive but clearly that is not the case
5960	1	it is not just about profit google and other companies have offered assistance on developing cheaper and better internet but the goverment is not interested in giving access to everybody so the goverment can limit access to information and avoid spreading coordination of anti goverment actions via internet like it occurred in some countries with civil unrest
5961	1	i dont know how they do it but you are right hotel cards only work in the hotels
5962	1	dont even think about it
5963	1	yo apuesto mi vida q tú o estas trancado en el cuarto q te paga tu tipo para hablar mierda online o no sales a la calle con tu aire de caballero blanco porque de lo contrario estarías sentado en un hueco te cambiarían por cigarros sueltos dentro y harían cola por ti
5964	1	i have my suspicion that that is the case
5965	1	ok thanks looking forward to meet cuba
5966	1	hey ubrosenkranzkeef i appreciate you taking the time to share commentsre fluency everything ive read online is that in the places we are going there are lots of tourists and that communication is pretty easy is that not your experience i am surprised because this is the first ive come across this concern also ive read that most hosts of casa particulares have pretty good english and can help arrange things like taxis medical attention etc re medical care from what weve read servimed is international has locations in all the popular cities and provides forpay medical care for tourists that is on par with anything wed find in canada i am aware that for most cubans health care is not on par and not what tourists receive am i mistaken in any of thisthanks again
5967	1	some sure others not so much anyway both blocking and censorship only damage the common people and those with the power to remove those barrier couldnt care less
5968	1	american airline is regulations for the cuban tourist cardvisa is stated herehttpswwwaacomi18ntravelinfointernationaltravelcubajspas youll see they make you purchase the tcvisa from cuba travel serviceshttpscubavisaservicescomproductaavisacard for a very expensive 85 usd aa has always been a bit of a rip offhappy travels
5969	1	te aseguro q no te arrepentirás de la experiencia
5970	1	im a us citizen and went to cuba like 2 weeks ago for the first time i was honestly worried myself about what theyd ask me but literally all they asked was what i was bringing back with me and how much of it and that was it easy i went to mexico city back in the summer and the agent asked me more about that trip where did you go who did you stay with what do you havejust stay in an airbnb and when you get back just get in line of the friendliest looking agent and if they ask just say you went to support the cuban people
5971	1	have you tried raw water just kidding
5972	1	i dont think it is more greasy at all it is literally not not many foods are even fried there is just oil in the food unless she calls all italian food greasy because they use about the same amount of oil as cubans do that was a racist and dismissive comment it is rice and beans and meat where the fuck does the grease come from
5973	1	nice i dont smoke either but its always a very cool present bringing one of those cuban fresh motherfukers good to know your hotel is in varadero you gonna love it there  at least the beach   havana its hard to suggest places from here but get lost inside the city try to visit differen municipalities starting from old havana then to center havana to vedado to playa and youll kind of feel the transition in the architecture and way of living from one of the most dense places in america into green neighbourhood with a lot of life but if thats your first time having a tour guide is always better cuz havana is big and it might be bit overwhelming if you wanna know it all unless if you wanna go outside old havanafood is awesome everyone just try to eat at paladares they serve typical cuban food for a fairly good price you will get a lot of rice beans meat pork most of the time frite bananas yuca fresh salads fresh fruits theres everything for all tastes my friend
5974	1	forgot to add one very important point if you have a direct flight home then buying at the airport duty free is fine but if you have a connecting flight it is way safer to purchase the booze in varadero and put it in your checked luggage the duty free handling in varadero can not be trusted and their standards are not always accepted by canadian security so you run the risk of having it confiscated if you go through additional security in canada

5981	1	two winters ago about 15 years ago one of the concerts i forget who it was playing but it was newsworthy got out of control i forgot what happened too sorry terrible storyteller here something crazy happened and people began running out and a stampede formed and lots of people were seriously injured my neighbor was one of them and she was so hurt it was horrifying not a peep in the news eitherwhen something happens it is like mib they clean up the blood and flash everyone with the memoryerasing stick
5982	1	depends on the part of florida only south florida miami area is it like cuba the north gets rather cool
5983	1	that is a pretty good analogy i think
5984	1	afaik mexican water is not worse than cuba if anything there is more transparency as to water quality because mexican govt doesnt treat negative stats as a state secret
5985	1	mmm not really im thinking fries or other deep fried stuff are super greasy but they are not dripping oil some home cooked meals seem oily because meat juices spices and fat so they look like they are way more greasy than they actually are
5986	1	esta pinga si es tripadvisor  firman moderadores de rcuba
5987	1	youre way overreacting none of the sites you mentioned are censored or banned but do whatever makes you feel comfortable

5990	1	gti was also just reading that i should be careful when im using a hotspot and going on websites that are blocked in cuba even with a vpnstop reading nonsense there is a small bunch of banned websites most if not all criticizing the government the rest is totally fine and about being careful even with a vpn no
5991	1	yo creo que de vez en cuando una foto de cuba es bueno sobre todo para gente que como yo no tuvimos chance de ver mucho de la isla antes de irse del paíseso o soy otro nostálgico con tremendo gorrion
5992	1	relajate y copera
5993	1	youre reading way too much into it it does mean you have shame but not in the way you think it does to have shame in spanish tener verguenza can also mean you are self aware enough to not do disgraceful things basically it means you have pride in yourself as an insult in spanish you can call someone a  sinverguenza which means a shameless person a scoundrel etc so in this context when you have verguenza or shame it just means that you dont act in a shameless manner
5994	1	tienes razón para muchos deportistas esto es una oportunidad gracias x tu respetuosa opinión mucha gente solo ofende y no les gusta aceptar cuando no tienen la razón
5995	1	havana to vinales is more like 3 hours
5996	1	of course i have have you those cute dogs sniffing around the people and luggage are trained to sniff out drugs if you think spending the rest of your life in a rancid dirty cuban prison would be fun can you at least film your arrest for the rest of us
5997	1	im assuming that you have never been in cuba though i might be completely wrong nevertheless just in case theres someone reading this thread and know little or nothing about cuba im leaving this link straight from cuba customs    httpwwwaduanagobcuindexphpvalorenaduanas3 i found the english version of the customs values and duties not as detailed as the spanish version must read  by the way if you traveling to cuba but you were not born in cuba you dont have to worry about custom duties while entering in the country the hardship is for cubans bringing stuffs for their friend and family and one more note i live in new york for 13 years and next trip to cuba will be the second time me going over there im just commenting based in my little experience and i dont claim to know it all
5998	1	hey iamnewhere2019 just a quick headsup  goverment is actually spelled government you can remember it by n before the m  have a nice daythe parent commenter can reply with delete to delete this comment
5999	1	oh i read that booking from us using credit card that i was using a third party entity not true ah
6000	1	i will try to book using my credit card and see what happens thanks
6001	1	it is not my job to fix your retraso mental pero anormales como tu tenemos de sobra
6002	1	will google it for sure thanks
6003	1	bueno en cuba es un poco difícil coger huevazos porque la familia de esbirros y dictadores de los castros ni huevos han dejado para comer lo de tarru si eso me paso cuando me singaba a tu madre por la mañana y ella de puta me engañaba por las noche
6004	1	yep they dont mention a lot of serious things in the news some years back a drug deal went wrong and i think 3 people got chopped up and dumped in artemisa one guy escaped and lived to tell the story no mention at all
6005	1	you can access those  as easily as you avoid the censorship
6006	1	cuban sandwich was invented in tampa florida but most places outside of south florida dont do it right it has to have mojo roast pork
6007	1	im traveling to cuba soon and i read that shampooconditionerssoaps are good gifts for host families in casas particulares  is it rude if i give people open bottles  i have quite a few conditioners that i didnt like but didnt want to throw away and i was thinking id bring those if it isnt considered insulting
6008	1	that sucks to hear oh well
6009	1	alguien parece que no la visto pasar hace rato
6010	1	cmon the cuban give doesnt want to give everyone access to info is old and fake maybe some old cows of them dont want but take a look to every park with wifi in cuba and will see it full of people talking and looking for things in internet it is all about money and infrastructure
6011	1	yeh this is accurate imho
6012	1	pero usted es una rata inculta y pajusaeso no se quita ni viviendo en otro país gracias a tu trabajo de jinetero en cuba  porque esta historia de reddit tuya dice mucho de ti pedazo de mierda
6013	1	youre so immature that you cant help but to resort to  vulgar personal attacks now that you realize you dont have a point grow up
6014	1	none of that is any more greasy than hamburgers french fries potato chips fried chicken mac n cheese pizza bacon etc
6015	1	and yes at least in the resorts ive been there is always internet in the lobby and is really fast
6016	1	if its international then i should keep my mouth shut but my mother works for one of those travel agencies cuban ofc and she usually advice friends to go straight to the hotel unless she got some kind of package or offer
6017	1	interestinggggg
6018	1	jajajajajjaa
6019	1	no lo conocia apuntado queda
6020	1	thanks for the input ill add that as a stop
6021	1	they have pigeons and chickens there
6022	1	yea i could access it but couldnt post a thing ig let me post on my stories however
6023	1	2 f pundonor estimación de la propia honra hombre de vergüenza
6024	1	i did know that i adore southern cooking quite a bit
6025	1	thank you for that website will use it
6026	1	same for me in december can pay in cash or card
6027	1	no one will ask you why you were there
6028	1	hahaha i know
6029	1	how was the price compared to booking online or thru a travel agent
6030	1	i couldnt say  we didnt book anything online  it was all through casa owners or taxi drivers recommending places to go  we would just rock up and ask the rate at a few places and choose whichever we liked we only had ore dust nigh in havana booked  everything else was done by the seat of our pants
6031	1	guy from rconservative quotes animal farm written by man actually fought with the socialists in the spanish civil war who was a socialist  libs destroyed
6032	1	im not able to say with certainty but i would hope this allows you to roam into their network using your existing plan and get some data servicebut next time i go im not going to leave that to chance ill send some money to one of my cuban friends and have them purchase a prepaid sim for me
6033	1	actually i have heard people say yo tengo verguenza to imply that they have honorpride and wouldnt behave in a certain manner it is used more as a contrast though for example youd say something like yo si tengo verguenza no como el descarado ese which i think is the way the word is being used in the patch theyre basically just saying we are not shameless like you
6034	1	qué interesante gracias
6035	1	my flight just let off in the same area as everyone else flying back into the country and the agent asked what i brought back couple t shirts and a handful of cigars that is it
6036	1	if they actually let you roam free  hop on a private cab and ask for whichever kind of fun rocks your boat  make sure to have cash on hand
6037	1	youd be surprised how much computer stuff goes on behind the scenes though getting official internet is the least of it
6038	1	gt but they shouldnt vary much  wether you book thru an agencyprices through one of the canadian tour companies can easily be half the walkup rack rate youll pay in cuba not even the big cuban government tour companies like cubatour can match them in most cases
6039	1	we just dont think eating should be a challenge in any way
6040	1	if an american goes to any other country in the world to work or play a sport professionally they still need to pay us income taxes this isnt much different
6041	1	no most of the world goes lmao
6042	1	gtthis is great news it makes basic cellular activities calls and messages 10010000 cheaper here in cuba 1 sms 009 now with 010 1 mb in the most expensive plans you can send what 1001000 whatsapps no matter how you look at it it makes everything cheaperstill expensive for the average cuban with a 20usd a month salary aaaand i bet the quality of the service is going to suck as everything else with etecsa
6043	1	varadero is not a half day trip from havana maybe if they drove there drove the main strip then turned around and drove back
6044	1	kinda makes sense
6045	1	there is plenty of ways to go legally 100 and other ways to go legally almost 100 if you want 100 do a cultural program music or dance i could tell you a few but there is a ton out there a little more expensive for a little more peace of mind
