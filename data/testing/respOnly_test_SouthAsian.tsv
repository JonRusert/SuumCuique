1	1	i did watch the video i still do not see your point of course i disagree with republican tactics that impede on democracy and measures have to be taken to stop it but suppression of speech is off the deep end into totalitarianism also if the point is going low to match going low then the strategy to match altrighters is rallying up angry youth who is voice and problems are not being heard in mainstream politics perhaps desis and advocating for their issues while simultaneously arguing that the root of their problems is in the altright as this is what the altright does with the left
2	1	ill clarify that i meant what care is offered from each type  without any context i took your post to be a commentary on the ability to prescribeview of overprescribing the process is definitely overwhelming and the financial aspects of finding care are an unfortunate but necessary first step referrals from primary care is a great place to start in the canadian context ive had assistance from a range of resources

6	1	those nations britain in particular do need to face their pastsindia has faced many challenges that western nations imposed on it  i see your point about why it would be hard for india to have the same levels of equality as western countries  but does that justification really do much  the victims of regressive policies are still victims regardless of the history behind those policies
7	1	meds can help im sure you know ssris snris and bupropion are pretty safe medications so it doesnt hurt to try them in my opinion you should probably see a psychiatrist to confirm your diagnosis i dont know how long youve felt this way ie if you have at least 5 of the 9 criteria for depression for more than 2 weeks plus if this is recent could just be adjustment disorder or hypothyroidism or something either way though it doesnt hurt to check with a psychiatristfor step 1 i recommend using boards and beyond in addition to the typical ufap resources bnb helped fill in the gaps in my memory of the details of many subjects while being specific to step 1
8	1	why are you saying that i feel like they are finally coming aroundedit nvm just looked at your comment history
9	1	i agree with you no one should be made fun of for their culture no matter what label it is under but it is still extremely irritating encountering selfhating desis or desis who are against other desis

15	1	comparing apples to oranges in my opinion jews in europe complaining about racism went unheard for the most part before ww2 i think the holocaust is a huge factor affecting how people respond to antisemitism today indians have not faced that kind of genocide in their history and if they have then they havent done enough to raise public awareness

34	1	regardless of what imran khan can or cannot do there is no evidence showing that the pakistani government has given any sort of support to this khalistani group the bjp congress cm seems to be grasping at straws to paint pakistanis as disingenuous after they opened the kartarpur corridor in good faith according to him pakistanis are guilty simply because some fringe separatist group is trying to ask them for supportedit congress not bjp
35	1	biting the joints
36	1	damn
37	1	httpswwwjatlandcomhomemalikuclarkkent160
38	1	yah the problem is that people use it to justify invasion and discredit indigenous culture in fact the very idea of indigenous cultures seem to be discounted and discredited the problem is that the west is still very ethnocentric the west not only reserves the right to define themselves but they also reserve the right to define other peoples and if any nation tries to define itself they are constantly labeled fringe rightwing fascist or a host of other slurs for examplegtit has experienced waves of migration and invasioneveryone has experienced waves of migration and invasion furthermore where are the migrations out of india has no one that entered india ever gone out
39	1	my relatives in india would feel the same way explains why 100 of them are overweight or obesedefinitely possible to eat the carbs in moderation and stay shredded instead of cutting them out all the way though

52	1	soyou want to bomb the shit out of britain to the point that it reaches third world country status because its people like churchill and are benefitting from its first world status all so you can assert your dominance and be friends damn
53	1	oops that is what i was saying
54	1	i get what youre saying but saying simply practicing yoga is cultural appropriation is a bit absurd i dont know a single indian that practices yoga or has any interest in doing soif the white middle aged mums practicing it pisses you off so much then you got issues
55	1	you literally just buried him
56	1	yep and there are ways to manage that which some states are already doing where youre limited to say a 3 or 5 day supply and have to go back in the risk is that once the person takes a day or two of medications there is a chance someone else gets a hold of them and it only takes 3 days to become addicted to opioids that leads a person down the tunnel to heroin

64	1	with a 1000 budget you will more than likely need a roommate only the places that charge 2000mon give you free parking garageyoud be better off in the suburbs living near a septa station so that you can get into the ucity area for drexel and not be crazy far from njde areas
65	1	i know its unfortunate really and takes away from becoming close and supporting one another
66	1	reddit still oftentimes echoes american perceptions i encounter on a daytoday basis i mentioned that the kids i grew up with have those ideas about indians ive made a few friends on my lifetime who didnt hesitate to insult india to my face and expected me to agree with them black folks may be insulted in certain pockets in the states but overall theyre considered to be cool and are taking over popculture dayin and dayout they also have so many role models to look up to im only starting to see a few good role models ie hasan minhaj for desi kids as of late the bollywood stars are a complete joke for the most part
67	1	id also like to see a major news org pick up this story but foreign interference was literally one of the first topics in the report

81	1	brahminical patriarchy is not the same as upper caste hegemony in the eyes of many indians this author her friend and twitter is pr team failed to recognise that and were forced to apologise caste is a complex issue using words carelessly especially when you are an outsider with little political clout will have consequences most indians support anti discrimination efforts provided they were messaged correctly in fact everyone would have applauded twitter if twitter said something about not tolerating caste based discrimination and added specific policies for it none of the other upper castes like rajputs or jatts  came out in opposition to the poster only brahmins were offended that should tell you that the poster was offensive not for the reasons that the author is saying i read through the interview of the poster is author she says the term brahminism is used on an everyday basis and she is claiming that bramins are wilfully misunderstanding it but that is not correct that term is not in everyday usage and brahmins are not wilfully misunderstanding it they just dont like their caste being used for that purpose some of them might know know what the author meant by brahminical patriarchy but they dont like the author using their caste for that purpose others not familiar with feminism or patriarchy may have entirely misunderstood it and it is not essential for the author to use that particular word to talk about what she wants to talk so why be stuck up on using it
82	1	the birthplace of nank was nankana sahib the capitals of the sikh empire were lahore and gunjanwalla for the provincial capitals it also included multan and peshawar historically these are the most important places in sikhism backwaters and traditionally second tier centers such as amritsar and chandigarh have grown in prominence to tier one centers only recently  since 1947to fully support sikh self determination we should be returning these most important lands of sikhism  mentioned above  back to the sikhsand while we are at it provide retribution for those who conducted ethnic cleansing of sikhs im sure as someone who supports sikh self determination youre all for this
83	1	this is so interesting thank you
84	1	just an observation not offended by op if that is what youre implying
85	1	httpsthewireinhistorygandhiandafricans
86	1	you think there is a strong marxist and atheistic streak in the spirit of bhagat singh in this rah rah sikh culture today no bhagat singh idolization from sikh people sanitizes his politics and atheism is for the most part pure nationalism gt he didnt condem singh but wasnt too keen on releasing him eitherwhat does this even mean he didnt agree with the guy but didnt want him to be killed petitioned the british multiple times to let him go they didnt and executed him and its gandhis faultno clue what youre saying here at all bhagat singh didnt deserve to die and gandhi tried to get him released anyone who hates gandhi on behalf of singh is really dumb and ignorant to the actual history of the independence movement
87	1	nope
88	1	my punjabi ancestry has existed much longer than any of the nation states you listed so its disingenuous for you to claim thats its recenti think you are having trouble with the concept of nationality and ethnicity your grandfathers nationality did change in the middle of his life because he migrated to a new nation just like your fathers nationality changed from pakistani to american when he migrated to the westtheres a shared history between punjabis in the diaspora and on the subcontinent that is a shared culture for me but beyond that i dont have any affinity or ties to the rest of south asia my identity customs language are much too different to be lumped in with a south indian from chennai or a bangladeshi from sylhet i am not of indian descent as india as a nation state has existed only as recently as my fathers birth my ancestry is of punjabis who lived under the rule of the mughals raja ranjit singh the british and before my birth came under the purview of the two nation states known as india and pakistanso just like how there have been varying kingdoms and nations of people who have formed and lived under various governance systems based on shared interests in the past that trend continues national identity doesnt erase your cultural identity we preach that in the united states so why dont we hold the same standard when discussing south asiayou wouldnt tell an african american that they should not hold their hyphenated identity in high regard in favor of a broad american solidarity so why push this backwards ass narrative with desi identity the point is to create harmony despite your differences not to look past the differences and erase minority cultures and identity in favor a hegemony by the majority
89	1	yeah didnt watch it either gave up on srk movies a while ago
90	1	gtnot sure how your comment is relevant to anything i said but ill bite theres certainly overlap of honor killings and extremism not only with pakistan but india nepal bangladesh and srilanka to some extent and your point i didnt even mention honour killings gtmaybe you werent able to keep up but the discussion is about ills of uk pakistanis vs pakistanis elsewhere like uscanada i spoke about how its difficult to let go of cultural practices for some in uk because the entire community migrated and brought all the machinery that allows a community to ensure conformity compared to individuals migrating to us and canada who arent surrouded by others from the same back ground and culture that is true yet as i mentioned that is also a problem with other pakistani groups as well you cant blame it all on mirpuri culture gtalso i gather youre an ex muslim claiming to be pakistani but you love to start bash pakistanis and muslims every chance you getyeah maybe if pakistani culture and islam didnt go around persecuting exmuslims and being generally shitty maybe i would have something more to be proud of but it is not like nationalists like you would understand that
91	1	or just date a bangladeshi guy who isnt like her dad

112	1	put brown sugar
113	1	what you mean by that is that you would essentially rather be rich than poor since the average brownindian guy has more money than the average black guy does in america i wouldnt want to be any other race i love being indian and myself but there is no point hiding the fact that the western world has alot of bias against us that many other minorities does not have to deal withi can guarantee that in general an uppermiddle class black guy gets less bullshit to deal with socially than a uppermiddle class browndesi guy does
114	1	i meant physical pain

118	1	in urban parts of america there are often large indian communities  new yorkillinois new jersey and california are states where there are significant indian populationsampx200bwhat about the whole issue of cultural appropriation  youd be surprised many indian americans are angry when they see white girls at music festivals wearing bindis and henna  there are many indian americans who dont know much if anything about the significance of those things but still wear them  i think that both of those cases should have the same side effects or lack thereof  but many would view those two cases differentlyampx200bim in college there is a lot of people like that you wouldnt believe it  i think those people should strive to tie their identity to something they have built and developed by themselves rather than sticking to a superficial version of a culture their ancestors were a part of

125	1	were gonna need a computer person to hack into yelp too lol
126	1	i could say the same about black people loot asian businesses rather than target the police department when a white cop guns down a black guy sounds like youre too afraid to confront your oppressors just like the zulus in south africa only attacked poor indians but didnt dare go against the white people who put them in chains
127	1	what do you do on social media particularly that makes it easier i mean besides messenger etc though for your usual friendsdoes sliding into dms actually work for brown guys when we are assumed to be creeps

173	1	i dont think she is in any way trying to absolve india of it is inequalities instead trying to document how the inaccurate historical presentation of the development of caste doesnt allow for the actual dismantling of the social system itself which the current indian political system is now dependent on never dismantling and thus allows foreign interests to continue a subtler form of colonisation through their biased human rights paradigm eg iraq wari think both you and uwinningalwayswinning have valid concerns with regard to whataboutism however this piece is not doing thatedit rephrasing

180	1	it is the most widely used and most validated but that doesnt mean there isnt room for improvement and yeah sorry didnt read that carefully but the end result is the same a patient was prescribed it which happens all the time it is an epidemic here in the us it is a combination of a lack of physician education on the issues which thankfully is on the upturn with compensation structure issues docs can be docs is the issue along with big pharma it takes 3 days for a person to become hooked on opioids which in turn has lead to the widespread use of heroin i recommend reading dreamland the true tale of america is opiate epidemic by sam quinones

217	1	the government honestly shouldnt be in charge of our educational system or school curriculum  it was never designed to take on that task and it moves much too slowly to adapt to changes in need for the workforce there are still aspects of it that are designed to prepare children for factory work  just anecdotally ive seen more people using other options more lately like charter schools homeschooling and virtual schools  using these options requires a social shift thats gonna take time but i dont see public education lasting the way its currently set up

226	1	theres nothing wrong with his parents wanting her to end up with an indian guy the problem is her parents are disregarding her wishes and tricking her into meeting other guys theyre trying to force a relationship to happen for their own benefit which is wrong
227	1	probably because 70 of the country is white theyre the most available numbers wise no matter where you go youre bound to run into one of them im sure that mentality is prevalent too for some people but availability is a big thing

231	1	the pain of regret is worse than the pain of trying
232	1	gt people should integrate into the larger social fabric and not erect parallel societieswhy not not all people are the same we are animals who are drawn to likeness people feel comfortable around their own and they gravitate towards their own the only responsibility any citizen has to the nation state is to follow the laws if they are involved in breaking the laws they get to go to jail you cant and shouldnt force someone else is values on others values and laws are not the same thing i value different things than you you shouldnt have to integrate into a society where your view is the minority lol since youre supposedly an exmuslim and a pakistani which i doubt that you are but lets suppose that you are would you like to integrate into pakistani society and adopt their worldview culture and values gt if you have people infringing human rights within those parallel societies such as fundamentalist mormons or mirpuri pakistanis then those communities should be abolished and integratedgo to jail if you break the law pretty basic concept closed communities arent magically above the law gt if you dont care for individualism that is fine but it raises questions of why you decided to move to the new country in the first place the kind of people we are talking about are economic migrants they didnt come for the society and values gt in a free society you shouldnt get to contribute to the same structures that make other people unfreenot exactly a free society if you can go to jail for voicing the wrong opinions but thats besides the point if you dont want people to living in their own communities make it illegal for people from the same background to move into the same neighborhoods thats how you create adjacent structures youll find adjacent societal structures with different lifestyles and value the ghettos the hamptons elitist neighborhoods hispanic neighborhood chinatown korean neighborhoods indian neighborhoods
233	1	calling out cultural appropriation is the equivalent of not integratingisolating oneself where did you go to school
234	1	gteveryone has experienced waves of migration and invasion furthermore where are the migrations out of india has no one that entered india ever gone outread not in disagreement dude the oldest segment of the dna sequence that these people are talking about 1500020000 years old originated in south asia migrated to central asia mutated and then came back again to south asia that is not what im arguing the point is how the narrative is being usedwhy isnt there a divisive narrative for britons franks or the dutch why not label their language culture etc as imported stolen or otherwise from an outside source the problem is that the narrative is being used to take away agency independence and ownership of history from india
235	1	sorry sis that is pretty awesome congratulations would you mind if we chatted some time about writing and how to publish also how is your friend breaking through screen writing thanks in advance and please feel free to share any of your writings id love to read some

245	1	that blog gave good advice agree with all you said
246	1	brah if you can destroy the world with a weapon ten times over your obviously a superpower israel usa india pakistan russia france china uk and possibly north korea and iran are superpowers in militaristic strength if you cant face facts i cant do anything to convince ya your obviously blinded by nationalism for india and hatred for pakistan delusional people like you wont make it far for in the application process for top tier schools sorryampx200bps also i am not in the islamic studies faculty but you seem to think that everyone studying in that department is a hardcore islamaphile lot of the profs are white dudes and a lot of the profs have critical academic views of text history and present day practice and thats completely fine they have specific nuanced views not blatant careless non specific hate for an islamic country like pakistan such as yourselfalso you said in your post  if they hand out degree to a guy who has arrived at the conclusion that having nuclear weapons makes the country a nuclear power i shudder to think the level of education they must have  wtf else would anyone conclude having nuclear weapons  nuclear power
247	1	actually if i am a nationlist like you then i wud rather agree that nuclear weapons makes the country a superpower when your country is struggling with eradicating polio it is hardly a superpower superpower is when you have global influence and make other countries bend or do things which favor you holding pakistan passport actually makes it difficult and warrants extra security checks the country is finding it hard to get funds and is having to beg for a few billions how can you even call it a superpower lol  before you go with india also doesnt have visa free access to other countries i am hardly claiming that india is a superpower i didnt even bring india in this discussion you can talk shit about india until you are satisfied or tell me i am not getting admitted admitted anywhere or derail the topic further none of it will strengthen your argument that pakistan or india or north korea are superpowersi dont intend to unnecessary reply to your university application commenst they are irrelevant which you brought up just to feel good about yourself but sorry just because you got into mcgill doesnt make your country superpower its not even relevant smh
248	1	the point was that sikh community has not been shut out from public service in indian establishment of course the discrimination violence injustice exist as they do in my multi ethnic society

252	1	i have family in alabama and cousins that grew up there interesting place youre right about some places id completely avoid
253	1	definitely not true i dont see how attractive you are would influence wheter you use reddit or notand even goodlooking desi guys who get dates regulary can still be aware of how much racism there is our there towards indians im one of those guys just because you can overcome it doesnt mean you dont want to talk about it there is a big difference from the people you are referring to posting complaints here conpared to the types you find at the incels subreddit
254	1	look man i am a very polite person both online and offline i am sorry for being rude and calling you stupid and that you studied islam in college if you unnecessarily bring personal stuff of my life in a completely unrelated topic i will react by making personal attacks although i absolutely hate to do so because i consider myself extremely empathetic respectful polite personnowhere did i call you anti india or hindu you keep calling me hindu hating on muslims and angry about partition if you actually read properly than i was talking about 100150 yrs ago when my ancestors were murdered in cold blood if it was partition i wud have reacted differently because both sides had lost humanity at that time for my family it was in peaceful time when a few left to nearby town for buying selling stuff for festival holi had they felt that the women and family they will leave behind faces hostilities and dangers they wudnt have gone imagine coming back to see your community has been massacred raped and you have no place to call home all this happened when there was no communal tension and then not receiving any support from any political party because they dont want to fan communal tension you dont get to say both sides have done shit just get over it because it wasnt during partition it happened much before whether you like it or not today the entire world is aware that extremism is more common among muslim community than others doesnt mean its non existent among other communities but it is much lesser on a scale when compared to muslims i guess pakistan is paying for all that today it didnt take stock of religious extremism and turned a blind eye as long as vicitms werent muslims so here it is today with islamism becoming bane for its existence because these islamista have run out of hindus to feed on so it has turned on itself shia ahamdis or what not but that is none of my concern i only worry about india  although it is completely unrelated to pakistan being a superpower i am just clarifying my other comments on a different sub which is completely irrelevant to the concept of superpower because you brought it upi didnt even click on your name let alone go through your history all i wanted to discuss was the concept of superpower and your comment didnt give me an indication that you have discussed this topic before so i dkdnt bother going through your historyif nuclear power makes you superpower then even north korea is one was my comment your only argument is if you can destroy the world you are superpower well if any country even nukes a city it will cease to exist as a country even usa doesnt have the guts to use nuclear weaponsidk you need to really understand what makes a country superpower india is on its way to become one maybe it will be in 3040 yrs as of now it is not pakistan is wayyyy down the bottom to be a superpower usa is definitely one and china i guess is almost a superpower now russia is also back in the game nowedit  i called you pakistani nationalist which you are otherwise you wudnt bother defending partition or even bring bring up partition neither wud you claim pakistan is a superpower  your username is mcgill so i guess you love the uni maybe it is your best accomplishment in life good for you and have a nice day
255	1	what schedule do you follow
256	1	a lot of immigrants definetly used to be republicans back in the day now theyre mostly dems guessing it has to do with the gops full embrace of evangelicals

264	1	college towns are always a little liberal even texas aampm which is somewhat conservative basically people are more educated nerdish and atleast understand not to indulge in the worst kinds of physical racism how many indians were at texas aampm at that time  i wonder also people have always respected professors doctors even racist people
265	1	umm yes their food is more delicious if thats insensitive

276	1	yeah you would
277	1	me personally  i dont think anybody should take pride in things they cant control  gender race sexuality etc  you should be neither proud nor ashamed of any of those things they just exist  selfworth should be determined by things you can controlbut obviously that is not the case for many people and ive accepted that  regardless of what people on this sub do indian americans in real life definitely do not focus on the negatives particularly the 1822 age group in college
278	1	i think this is the only thing people need from jordan petersonhttpstwittercombritishgqstatus1057234945427628032langen

283	1	no be afraid be very afraid  i very seriously nearly fucking died of food poisoning by doing this last time i visited india just because youre ethnically indian doesnt mean youre immunized to the multitude of horrible pathogens endemic to india you didnt have back where youre coming from

287	1	no  vegans are mostly misinformed working in the biomedical space we slaughter over 100 million animals every year for the purpose of advances in science  most medicinesbiologics are mammalian based like blood thinners which the crude is sourced from pig slaughterhouses  vegetarianism is fine but veganism imo is extreme and most vegans i have met try to push their agendas on to others
288	1	caucasian women by far and then south asian women occasionally
289	1	yea i never understood the standoffish attitude toward being friends with other ethnicities i definitely got judged for it from afar but it just stops mattering as we get older now the only time i run into such cliques are at the gurduwara but i am there twice a year

292	1	the only people who are incels are those who call people incels and use words like incels
293	1	oh yeah even i have to keep reminding myself of that thanks to internalized american exceptionalism and even right wing scumbags like nigel farage dont want to be associated with tommy robinson whereas you cant say the same about us republicans i think americans forget how far right weve gotten and often just cherrypick the worst incidents of racism in eastern or southern europe to act like the us is such a beacon of tolerance
294	1	marrying a white guy is basically social suicide as far as extended family is concerned and close family depending on what they are like
295	1	i dont think there is anything in hinduism saying something cannot be eaten literally beef is praised as being tasty as is horse meat
296	1	i have seen marriages lasting in india where hindu marries muslim there is family pressure and non acceptance but the moment nationality changes i wonder how the problems change do they decrease or do they end up opening a whole new pandora is box
297	1	he didnt call them perverts but he made fun of their stereotypes russiansslavs  their wardrobes weird habits etc japanese  anime tv shows etc indians  bobs and vagene i cant link you to the specific videos because there have been so many vids in between but he has themes in his weekly yiay videos which include his subreddit memeing all of the said stereotypes in good funedit in the dr phil episode he is done he takes the piss out of western culture in every one of them
298	1	i apologize if you find this offensive but you sound like an incel with such arguments now that i have taken a look at your post history you do seem to be one i initially thought that you were trying to be a realist but your arguments and lack of actual sources seem to indicate otherwise my motivation to argue with you has gone down now this sub seems to be filled with incels who are obsessed with wanting to date in our elite university circles we dont give a damn about dating and focus on building our careers it would be far easier to find women after that regardless i will address your points but please dont reply unless you have some proper sources and argumentsgtyou want me to believe a dating app with 31 reviews most of which are calling it a scam and asking for their money to be refunded rated at 25 starswhich review website are you referring to even i can choose arbitrary websites like consumeraffairs and say that tinder only has a rating of 11 with 37 reviews or that okcupid has a rating of 13 with 43 reviews many of which are also calling them trash and asking for a refund the official google play rating for firstmet is 39 for tinder is 40 and for okcupid is 41 and that difference is mostly because of the interface and featuresgthas a 18 million user basewhat are you even talking about the 18 million was the sample size in the uk not the userbase in that case the okcupid survey is maximum sample size for the questionnaires in it is around 1 million in the us does that mean okcupid only has a userbase of 1 millionyou quoted the columbia paper it is a good study with over 167 citations let me link it herehttpsfacultychicagobootheduemirkamenicadocumentsracialpreferencespdf firstly the paper specifically states that south asians have been omitted because there were too few of them secondly the same paper proves my point that if people from different races are equally attractive and have a good game they are almost equally likely to get a date through a dating website just like the match rate was almost equal in the okcupid survey which chose a sample with people who were rated similarly in attractiveness the results for face to face meeting seem to be different and i will talk about it in the end and that is the main objective of the paper too let me quote the paper regarding attractiveness firstgtwe find that most coefficients are not significant and in fact 10 out of the 24 point estimates are positive the only coefficients that are negative and individually significant are hispanic mens ratings of asian women and white and asian womens ratings of black men given the overall number of coefficients we estimate however these three effects are likely to be spurious therefore we conclude that a subjects own race does not influence the rating of a partners attractiveness this finding gives us confidence that we can meaningfully speak of objective attractiveness and thataverage rating is a reasonable proxy for itasian men received a low rating in attractiveness because most of them in columbia do not groom themselves and their main focus is studies and they are the group which required the highest merit to be admitted it is not because of their race let me quote another sentencegtboth of these changes derive from the fact that our pool of asian males generally received low attractiveness ratings strikingly we observe almost no residual heterogeneity in racial preferences after controlling for physical attractiveness in no case can we reject the equality of race coefficients and furthermore no two coefficients are significantly different from one anothernow let me talk about the main variable of interest of the paper the fraction of yeses for male and female subjects these are means of percentages of people from a certain group who say that they are fine with dating the subject of another group after a fourminute conversation the percentage yeses for asian males was 48 while that of white males was 46 this shows that despite this sample of asian men being rated lower for attractiveness women were willing to date asian men more than white men after meeting them if their attractiveness level was the same the dominance would be even higher so you essentially shot yourself in the foot by citing this study the incel community has made a strawman of this study by just quoting the table for attractiveness rating

317	1	gtone thing i have noticed common in many pakistanis that they dont seem to acknowledge the terrorist attacks of india dawood is a big deal for us i am from mumbai and lost 3 different acquaintances in 3 respective attacks  92 2006 2008  but they seem to take it very lightly once in a family conversation my ex really casually said  we should give these poor guys this dawood back  i think that moment really brought out the afterall you are a pakistani in mesame with indians tbh many dont even know about the samjhota express bombings because pakistani is dont hold it over their heads every two minutes and they downplay the role of indian backed terrorists that kill punjabi is and sindhi is in balochistan i mean the attacker of the chinese embassy in karachi was getting medical treatment in india before he was killed in afghanistan last week i have met many decent indians who have the capacity of objectivity but many are bigots like you who think pakistani is are savages and indians are the paragons of virtue
318	1	yeah it sucks nondiary milk substitutes all taste bad too like almond milk  eew

320	1	just had very fetishist views towards muslim guys in college i came across many such indian girls that would come to the us for studies and would wanna sleep with a pakistani guy however for all the wrong reasons i mean she would say things like how her parents wouldnt even share cutlery with a muslim and that made being with me more exciting for her

325	1	gtdating out of your race doesnt make you better than everyone else and looking down on people wanting to date within their race just makes you a self hating dumb assholeadding to that expecting it to help you integrate into whiteness because lbr every time this sub talks about interracial dating they pretty much always mean white people is living in a fantasy land ask fred korematsu how much dating a white girl helped him when the authorities grabbed him to ship him off to an internment camp
326	1	most of the human rights organizations have ulterior political moves there were some cases of killings but to assume that the sole purpose of army is just killing people is absolutely absurd i would say the indian army is the most humane when it comes to dealing with islamic extremistsamerica uk or israel would have carpet bombed the area indian army doesnt even use bullets not to mention the kashmiris openly wave isis flags spew hatred against hindus india and not a single kashmiri has been persecuted for the pandit genocide which killed more than 5000 hindus and displaced many of them

332	1	gt canadians can barely afford housing and cant raise a family in a basement apartment some single new immigrant working for peanuts with no children to support in this more expensive country can doisnt that a wrong comparison though shouldnt you be comparing single canadian workers with the single immigrant workers gt if a job cant be filled because nobody will work for that low of a wage the natural forces the free market should increase that wageyes this applies to your local industry but for an industry which generates revenue across the nations borders it will be impacted by labor across the border whether in form of immigrant labor or labor in the destination country if canadians dont want it to higher immigrant labor then they restrict their business within canada similar to how the govt of canada it jobs are restricted to  canadians and not immigrants and i think ibm is an american company and listed on the nyse first and not on toronto stock exchange so it is a foreign company to begin with
333	1	lol i get one nice reply and one nasty reply from you and duck off with calling me sweets
334	1	it was an regular restaurant not fine dining but not a hole in the wall place either1 we walked in and waited to be seated the owner manager saw us then turned away and went back to what he was doing several minutes later a server showed up and let us up to a table the restaurant had only one other table occupied at the time2 while we were getting settled in the server disappeared we waited several minutes again for someone to show up to take our orders no amount of waving could get the manager is attention finally the server took our drink order 3 the drinks took close to 20 minutes to show up by now other tables were starting to fill up with white people and they were getting prompt service4 we finished our drinks and there was still no sign of the server finally he showed up to take our orders after that we were ignored for the next 45 minutes till we threw a fit demanded the check for the drinks paid that off and prepared to leave the manager said nothing and did nothing all this while5 as we were walking out of the door the manager called out a ok bye at our backs

339	1	that is good for you i hope one day ill have a fulfilling life like you have and i wouldnt really care about all those social expectations
340	1	i dont think i would be prepared to settle down in india at this point i still have a better time there in terms of fulfilling interactions and relationships than in america but on each visit i find it more difficult to deal with the inconveniences of living there the traffic the level of cleanliness and organization the pollution etc when i was a kid i dont remember these things even registering as huge problems i still struggle with loneliness living in america but i can bear with it at least for now if it ever gets too much or if india continues to improve and makes significant reductions in pollution i might seriously consider moving to india for now i appreciate the time i spent in india as a teenager and the lessons i learned about being a part of a closeknit joyful family my hope for now is to create a family in america that resembles the one i might have had in india

349	1	then do it look for tutors take classes or ask native urdu speakers to help you
350	1	allowing the museums to keep the stolen artifacts encourages more artifacts to be stolen stolen artifacts should be pursued vigorously and anyone who had anything to do with them should be punished only then will the stealing stop all the recognised artifacts are safe in india the unrecognised ones in the rural and not so famous sites are the ones that go missing the proper response is to identify these sites and safegaurd them not allow the stealing to continue in the hopes that the thieves will take better care of themhaving these artifacts in india will allow indians to be more in touch with their heritage i would prioritize that much more than what these artifacts can do in western countries

353	1	well your politics are still terrible unironcially calling yourself a socialist modern day trickle down policy is cancer i understand that but socialism is also canceralso leftists oppress indians by treating them as if they face no racial discrimination and are actually privileged

365	1	gtso while i see all of us as one of the same there are way too many blind nationalists that ignore the similarities and focus the microscopic differences in effort to make themselves seem different or better  gt  gtin terms of similarities i would put it at a 9 i think were all one of the same in terms of the closeness i feel with other desis its like a 2 im not allowed to have an outside opinion without people making claims that im not desi or that im white washed i dont like saying this but i cant help but be prejudiced towards 95 of desis who arent westernized and its mainly due to the more traditional folk acting like gatekeepers cant help but agree with both of these it is fine to be proud of your cultural heritage and stuff but many folks are taking it to an extreme where it is like they create a cult and decide who is in and who is out based on a list of criteria to define x or y being called whitewashed for petty things like watching baseball and not cricket not being religious or vegetarian etc etc or say hitting the gym is idiotic at its best it is not benefiting anyone but instead dividing people further than uniting and is pretty toxic

370	1	amen honestly the idea of passing down culture and tradition will in some ways become futile as generations go by cultures have been changing and evolving since the beginning in all countries to think of it the culture of our parents and grandparents were vastly different than the culture of the current generation so when people say they are going to pass their cultures and traditions to their kids what are they trying to pass down because kids will be adopting values and beliefs of the present time they are living in not the values and beliefs that we grew up during our time  for sure share with them the heritage and culture you grew up with and make it positive most important but at the end like you say itll be up to the kids to decide what they want to take from it you cant force your children to live a certain way for the sake of upholding your culture and tradition their culture will be vastly different from our culture
371	1	son in hindi
372	1	no calling out cultural appropriation is stupid because youre implying that non desis shouldnt practice yoga because its an inherently indian concept which is stupid because youre insinuating that only indian people can practice yoga and that anyone else who did was guilty of cultural appropriation i went to school in brooklyn one of the most diverse places in the world why
373	1	so the core idea behind mgtow is factbased and one of the most smart decisions you can make i sleep with women but dont have relationships if you like ocasiocortez though you are missing something in the head
374	1	sounds like you have committment issues do your parents have a good relationship thats what i see is usually a cause for that it also sounds like youre afraid of losing your freedom by being tied down you should reevaluate what being in a relationship means to you right now youre jumping the gun and probably psyching yourself out planning a hypothetical future with whatever girl youre looking at very few people will ever look st someone and think wow theyre the one more often then not they become the one overtime the best relationships are forged not found you should never settle for someone but the more people you push away the less options youre left with in the end
375	1	gt whoa the well is poisonedi tell you your comment has no relevance to what im discussing you ask me whats my point __  i tell you this isnt a complex discussion and now you tell me the well is poisoned it appears you simply do not have the mental fortitude required to understand that your comment not being relevant to the discussion is the point lol gt yet certain groups are a bit more problematic than others i am sure you would agree i dont see hindu or sikh grooming gangs in britain i think that is an important bit of detail you seem to want to omitthis further gives credence to the fact that you dont understand what youve read if you recall i mentioned hegemony can be a good thing or a bad thing tight knit communities can exasperate bad practices in the case of grooming gangs 84 of all convicted in grooming gangs were asian out of with 70 some percent were pakistani 222 men in total out of a million plus living in uk these guys appear to be pimps and sex traffickers who have figured out a way to get their sex workers at an early age to bypass having to pay the sex worker and control them other sex traffickers may not be groomers but they certainly exist in other communities some of them even end up in joining these grooming gangs this couple of hundred are hardly a reflection of pakistanis in the uk or pakistani culture rest assured sikhs and hindus have their own problems in the uk and at home we dont impose actions of a few who are involved in sex trafficking on the rest of the million plus strong community gt so fair enough so then you agree the problem is pakistani culturenope no more than raping is a hindu problem gt well you accused me of being fake  so it is a bit relevant here actuallyyou started the conversation with an irrelevant point anything i said to you comes after you thumping your irrelevant rhetoric

390	1	liberals consider desis as privileged even though the reality is we are one of the most discriminated against ethnicites both socially and systematically if not the one who is discriminated against the most simply because we work hard and are talented losers on the liberal side would rather think we are privileged rather than more capable than them the truth hurts them and makes them feel inadequate

409	1	can you share your experiences which made you conclude this my personal experience is this happens with indians maybe i can be wrong
410	1	thats because you got married to a catholic catholic and christian are different sides of a coin indian catholics are usually goankonkani while mallus have a mix of christian and catholic population op is most likely with a protestant christian as i have a lot of mallu protestant friends and ive noticed the guys girlfriends often came to me and inquired about this whole have to convert to marry shit

414	1	castesystem is an absolute joke youre telling me i should judge and treat people differently not for their actions but their dna not even that it is literally depending on a surname which anybody can change i understand and maybe i can empathise as to why a civilisation wouldve followed this system back in the millenia delegation of labours spread of law and order and whatnot caste system is a similar albeit explicit form classism which still persists in nearly all modern societiesbut to witness castebased prejudice in this day and age the irony is palpable the very people who are barbarically vain of their tribe whilst looking down on others would be unable to recognise how the castesystem opresses the potential of otherwise talented peoples ultimately bringing down the prosperity of the very nation they are so proud of

421	1	can you cite where he specifically insulted his parents and faith
422	1	rather not say ive been doxxed before
423	1	i wont discount the experience that youve had because that is your experience however in general im seeing overarching sweeping statements against white people and the above communities you tend to hear from the most vocal and stereotyped version of those communities the reality is that the majority of us are not those archetypes that you mention we hear about the worst republicans and democrats from either side the false boogeyman so that we can in good conscience say that theyre crazy again the reality is that the majority of people who fall into whatever group really arent the portrayed stereotype i fall into both those groups you mention a lot of my friends fall into the groups you mention if anything weve called out each other for falling prey to generalizations i do know what it is like to be discriminated against and as such i speak out against people who discriminate if im failing my own morals theyve called me out on in it no one is perfect and all of us have biases that show up  the trick is recognizing that i really dont know anyone in real life that has ever said i cant be racist im gayfemale but i have heard the trope online i would urge you to talk to real people that fall into those categories to see what their thoughts are if you have and your generalization holds true talk to more people because i really havent met anyone like that in real life

429	1	the problem with this article is that there is a bunch of true stuff  and a bunch of obviously false stuff such as that brahmins live povertyfilled livesjust because impartiality isnt ever 100 doesnt mean that there are writings that are more impartial some pieces do have more of a political goal than intellectual curiosity and this is definitely one of them it is pretty clear that the goal is support bjp rather than understand hinduismfor what it is worth i have an issue with partisan hacks on both sides sjws casting everything as oppression thus trivializing true oppression also get my goat

481	1	gti think it is wrong that people avoid criticizing their own group or culture especially if they want to enact change in other groups or cultures not really possible if you are an abcd how can you enact change in a community you dont actually live in but are only ancestrally apart of unless you do live in some kind of big south asian community i for one do notgti can see why your mom did that but i dislike people clinging to the superficial elements of their culture i think that by definition that damages the meaning of those cultures ive been guilty of this in the past and i am actively working on being less superficiali wouldnt say i am strongly clinging to superficial things everyone in my family for example wears western clothes and we grew up doing it even for most special occasions and even weddings we all wear western clothings which seems to be uncommon for other south asian families but we are christians to be honest i dont see how it damages the culture like if a abcd or even a white person wears a bindi without knowing the meaning i cant see any direct negative side effectgtin america i see a very standard progression in the indian american mentality in their youth they grow up exposed to both american and indian cultures and participate in both however kids at school make fun of them for their indian culture so their preteen and early teens are spent being ashamed of indian culture and trying to act less indian once they become young adults they become woke and reclaim their indian culture often to a fault which is why i made this posti agree with this maybe they feel so rejected from mainstream western society they need something they can identify with but they are sensitive about their identity because they feel that is all they have that being said i have never met anyone like this in real life it seems to disproportionately manifest itself on the internet i feel like some of them may have actually be more recent immigrants not abcds id also be curious to know if the sentiment comes from their parents or grandparents who may only feel apart of their indian community and not where they live which could be white

506	1	open your eyes just go on rraisedbynarcissts and read the shit that people on there go through i go through the same stuff x2 because my parents are indian and come from a culture where its socially acceptable to treat your kids like fucking property until theyre 40 years oldexample my mom and dad socially isolated me since i was 14 removing me from school 9th grade onward and not allowing me to make friends my dad did not allow me to attend college either and instead had me start working in   it starting in 2015 on a fake resume im 25 years old now but they still treat me like i am 10 years old im not allowed to spend money on anything or do anything on my ownlately ive started disobeying my dad more and everytime i do he goes batshit crazy just 2 days ago he had me start helping him fix an appliance part it had been 5 hours i was helping him and it was 11 pm and was getting late so i told him firmly that i was done working and was going to bed because i had work tomorrow he looked fucking shocked and then started mocking my tone of voice without responding to him i put down the flash light and started walking off then he grabbed my shirt collar back and pulled me and told me to continue working and started calling me all kinds of horrible names in punjabi i got mad at him for hitting me and then he dared me to call the cops in a mocking toneearlier this year he tried to arrange my marriage with his coworker who was many older than me the only reason he thought it was ok was because she was punjabi and he liked her personality i did not even see her yet or know what she looks like and he decided who i was going to marrynow heres the deal whenever i tell indianamericans about incidents like these they are a little shocked at first but they understand what i am going through they also go through similar things although less extreme but they fully support me in cutting off contact with parentson the other hand  indian people from india almost always think my parents are justified in doing it yes they think it is justified for my parents to not allow me to have friends for my dad to control what i do 24 7 their reasoning is that i must have done something bad to deserve it  or i somehow broke my parents trust   when in reality  i have never even had a chance to break my parents trust in the first place they simply cant even fathom the idea that parents can be shitty people

541	1	i have no authority over hinduism or any other religion but let me try voicing out my opinions on this i believe homophobia arises from the very fact that it is contrary of every relationship defined in the religious booksthere are 2 reasons to hate something1 it is explicitly stated that this must be condemned2 it is opposite to something that is considered to be the normhindu mythology only talks about a relationship between opposite gender any same gender relationship is treated as brotherly or sisterly or parental in nature homophobia in hinduism derives its roots from the fact that it is opposite to whatever is being propagatedits acceptable to have mistresses like lord krishna or pretty much every other god had but falling in love with a person of same gender is paap

546	1	this is what you saidgt read her comment history shes a thot with 0 self respect or shame who has likely taken dozens of pink dicks same as many desi women shameful that desi men will defend this degeneracy lmfao go ahead let white men take your white supremacist women too after they fucked your entire subcontinentit is not only about applying puerile stereotypes to subcontinental women do you not think that calling a woman a thot with 0 self respect or shame solely predicated on what you presume the ethnicity of her lovers to be is regressive and inappropriate for a genderinclusive forum it is peculiar that race relations would have degraded in such a manner that it is now considered acceptable to label interethnic relationships as degeneratei personally dont thot police subcontinental men who have a tendency to date women of certain ethnic backgrounds and i would have appreciated it if the same courtesy was extended to women who are subject to a higher amount of scrutiny in their dating choices than men we are not each other is property and compatibility should be much more important than ethnicity or adhering to some antiquated us versus them narrative

549	1	i empathize with the yelling back part of handling indian parents they really bring the worst out of you even if youre a nice person 99 of the year cordial polite kind considerate with literally everyone else theyll really push you to the edgethat being said you really should have talked to people who have served in the military before that arent recruiters i know a shitload mostly marines handful of army guys and one navy and even despite my moral qualms with joining a western military nothing theyve said has made it seem like a worthwhile decisionevery experience is what you make of it for sure but besides getting money for college there is very little to make of joining the military and most of what youll be doing is in support of an organization that terrorizes more innocent people across the world than literally anyone else the us military has a higher innocent body count in more countries than isissome times i really dont think indian parents know what theyre yelling about and just want you to fit their rigid and arbitrary rules for being their child but im not sure that is the case in this scenario i really think they have your best interest in mind when they try to make you rethink enlistingif your mind is set at least go to college so youd have a chance at ocs enlisted military is the most dead end shit in the world
550	1	because im an atheist and i dont find commonality with other muslims i dealt enough with religion and culture growing up that i dont want my significant other and household to reflect that im not closing the door completely but i have dated other desi girls who were culturalreligious and it never worked out because of the clashes belief system is a big factor for me when determining attraction and the pragmatism behind the relationship

560	1	yeah but how much choice does she actually have or thinks she has it seems like her husband wants these kids it seems like she didnt have much of a choice in marrying him so i question how much choice she has in regards to continuing to try to children it seems like he is reluctant to try ivf and i just wonder if there is actually more elements of powercontrol that were not seeing i completely agree that it is terrible that these kids are being brought into this world only to suffer and die i just dont want to assume stupidity when there is so much about her life and circumstances that we dont know i would rather try to understand their potential motivations than make quick judgments about people we will never know i work with vulnerable populations and blaming people for bad behavior never works trying to understand and meeting people where theyre at helps to facilitate change
561	1	think about seeing a professional  they really helped me  i know there is a lot of stigma about it still in our community but you are responsible for your future and should do what is best for you  wishing you luck
562	1	obviously theyre just playing scrabble and reading the bible scome on man dont be obtuse two college age kids hanging out in a dorm super late at night together
563	1	the lobbyist i spoke to said there was a difference between what they were saying publicly and what they were doing behind the scenes to your point sundar pichai and satya nadella got their green cards via the h1b  i140 process so i would assume they are for it or at the very least will not be actively against itsince it was second hand information it is likely i understood it too broadly the conversation started when we were discussing zuckerberg is initiative who the lobbyist called two faced
564	1	the death toll of kashmiri muslims is over 90000 and over 10000 raped and another 10000 disappeared you seriously want us to believe that the indian army isnt using bullets those must be some really advanced pellet guns theyre using just a few inflitrators mostly likely planted wave isis flags doesnt mean the majority of kashmiris support them or even care of isis the separatist movement decades older than isis or any religious terrorist organizations i dont know what pandit genocide youre talking about theyve always made 5 of the population and that hasnt changed according to recent censuses

572	1	here is a list of companies that spent money on hr392 httpswwwopensecretsorglobbybilllobsphpidhr392115 i see several tech companies in the list including ibm salesforce amazon microsoft texas instruments cisco etc but i am not completely sure that all the people in the list lobbied for it some of them may have lobbied against it from what i heard so far hospitals non tech industries and some other community orgs like iranian americans are opposed to it hospitals because they are afraid it might make recruiting nurses harder for them and other immigrant communities because they dont like standing in the line with us
573	1	op said that her husband is supportive of her culture and is not against having their baby be exposed to it he is not against op for speaking gujarati or immersing the tot in the culture traditions going to temple him not speaking the  language nor participating in certain things if he is not comfortable with doesnt mean or shouldnt be assumed that hell be discouraging the kid from exploring the op is heritage nor should it have to hinder the kid is selfconfidence or identity if the kid wants to explore something im sure hell be supportive of it and will participate in that sense of course it all should be encouraged but if not partaking why would it be an issue it is completely okay imo i dont think anyone should force these things on anyone only thing that should be expected is show that genuine respect and be open which the husband seems to be doing  the actions of one parent doesnt always have to reflect on the kid  im sure the father will encourage the kid to embrace both backgrounds and take the best of everything or what the kid feels will resonate with him especially when he is older and can think for himself and is establishing his own identity he is getting exposed to everything which is good and hell decide when older what he want to take from it regardless of what influences he has had i am not sure if this makes senseampx200bampx200bfor utoofemmetofunction the father seemed to have a disdain for the wife is side and acted like it is is something weird cant find the post now argh that is probably why there was a sense of insecurity of being open to the other side and shot down the selfesteem because he made the wife is background look as if it is something negative or inferior however i wish this poster realizes that he or she doesnt have to take in that negativity and just navigate it even if the father is not keen on it afterall the poster should be doing it for him or herself not the father it is not the case with the op is situation and therefore i really do not see a problem

579	1	gtalso 50  is just a unbacked number someone just threw out there there is no hard evidence  to that and is just someone is anecdotal evidencethe article itself said 63 of pakistani mothers in bradfordit is not a random figure it is based on actual researchgtin 2013 researchers published findings on cousin marriage in the lancet 63 of pakistani mothers in born in bradford were found to be married to cousins and experienced a doubling of the risk of a baby being born with a congenital anomalyhttpswwwbbccouknewsstories46558932from the article about the 2013 researchhttpswwwbbccouknewsukenglandleeds23183102gtof 5127 babies of pakistani origin 37 had married parents who were first cousins compared to less than 1 of married couples nationallygtgtlast year the bib project found cousins getting married was becoming more common among britishborn pakistanis in bradford than a generation ago
580	1	lol i frequent that subreddit my mother is the narcissist and ive been disowned luckily i have friends who arent muslims but are willing to learn and spend holidays like eid with me so i dont feel so alone its not just a white thing its a dysfunctional family thing but being evil to your parents ive found to be more a white thing kids in school used to tell me to sneak out all the time and i was like
581	1	gt education into pain management because asking patients to rate their pain on a scale from 110 is outdated and there are far better ways to measure subjective pain the bigger issue is the disproportioanother big issue is the doctor rating system a lot of patients come in expecting to be given some magical pill for pain its usually opiates that they want and if the doctor refuses they criticize them and leave bad reviews online a lot of docs probably figured that its better to give them what they want then risk losing businesstaking professional hits
582	1	i fucking wish
583	1	gtthe divorce rate in this country is 51 that is a myth that has been perpetuating for some time its more like 15 also at least they are able to choose divorce have you seen the amount of desi parents who just stay married miserably because what will people say etc etc keeping the face nonsense
584	1	let is say a man in mississippi had a greatgreat grandfather who died fighting for the confederacy  he is a moral person that doesnt display any prejudice towards minorities  if he flew the confederate flag in his house to honor his ancestor would you seriously have no problem with it  he is a good person that is honoring his heritageampx200bwe arent responsible for what our ancestors did i agree with that  but a key concept of leftwing ideology is that there are lingering effects from the actions of our ancestors that play a role in our lives today  it is distasteful to fly the confederate flag because at the end of the day the flag represents the oppression of black americans  i believe that the injustices that women and poor people have faced in india warrant a similar reaction to overt displays of indian culture
585	1	theyre just doing it for the money bro but there has been efforts made in the us in several states recognizing the sikh genocide
586	1	in leftleaning circles there is generally a consensus that the confederate flag should be viewed as a symbol of oppression  i can accept thathowever my issue and what prompted this topic is the reactions of leftleaning indian americans  they tend to espouse the same values as the general leftleaning population in america and hold the same view towards the confederate flag  again i accept thatbut why would they turn around and ardently defend indian culture a culture whose values are also oppressive  just because it is the culture of their ancestors doesnt give them a reason to apply different logic  they are biased and dishonest about their views and beliefs if they do that
587	1	brother  thanks for sharing your story loneliness is the root cause of our problems lonely is so multidimensional as well it is possible to live in a very crowded manhattan apartment and be so lonely
588	1	what kind of bs are you smoking every census from before parition during rule put muslims at the majority in west punjab sikhs have never outnumbered muslims
589	1	yeah i agree with you sure pasthuns in pakistan most likely dont like to be associated with india since they are originally from afghanistan but pakistani punjabis and indian punjabis are the same genetically as for nepal its culture is mostly indian in origin the mahdesi tribe that lives in nepal are basically indian descent people who live within nepals border and there are other tribes like this there buddha was also an indianindoaryan in terms of his racial background the tibetoburmanmongoloid derived people in nepal have nothing to do with the buddha and the dharmic cultures in nepal they have adopted alot of it but they also bring in some of their own south east asianeast asian cultures and i guess they identify more with that than with the rest of south asia becuase of how they look
590	1	well thats just your opinion its not an objecive reality for a lot of people including me there are a lot of negatives to marry outside your ethnicity and really no positives at all im not gonna force my views on other people though there is no such thing as blending cultures and marrying someone else isnt about being a race traitor or sell out it causes much more problems for both you and your kids than its worth at all
591	1	yogi b was an og as well
592	1	yes this is very true the comparison is really toxic
593	1	the indian people where i live lowkey hate black people so i guess it is just different where i live indian girls only date white guys guys dont try to act black or anything
594	1	ive regularly seen such scenarios posted on the sunday thread of abcds marrying someone from the motherland and im always curious is this people still living in south asia and moving to the states post wedding or people living and working in the us but still citizens of a south asian country the former seems bonkers for abcds
595	1	gta huge majority of foreign residents nurses are working on h1b in usa because there is no other way apart from j1  gt  gtj1 while being an option comes with the nori ordeal some time back india stopped issuing noris andor had become very strict and there is no way you can stay here long term on j1  gt  gtgood luck working in usa on j1 after your residency is done and then good luck getting nori approved by the government of india if not bye byeampx200bfrom the indian standpoint not a bad deal it reduces the brain drain ampx200bregardless as for residents medical schools here have ramped up class sizes and do is have flooded the market as well i dont think the need for visa sponsorship is going to be around much longer based on gme at my institution
596	1	seems to be true enough  certainly compared to the uk
597	1	you are right ive spent a lot of time in such a circle so i have a large sample size but the particular community i was in was extremely toxic you know how wokeness is almost entirely performative in college people have no problem sending a tweetstorm about police brutality but they clutch their purse when a black guy walks by and they say the n word when rapping along the people im describing were the minority but they were the alphas of the social groups which is why i dont trust the communities  they held disproportionate power and sway over the conversation and would use really shitty tactics to shout others down it was like elementary school many people ive met outside of that scene gay feminist straight white whatever were wonderful people and would go to bat for anyone at the drop of a hat
598	1	thats actually so dumb

605	1	nah i do the same thing honestly and when ive asked any of my buddies of routines before dates theyll make sure to brush their teeth and have gummints on them or in their car single people girls or guys generally keep some around now that im thinking about it i wonder if asking the date if they want a mintgum after a meal is some form of signalling that yall might kiss or make out later although it is just considered good etiquettemanners so i might be over thinking it my thoughts is that youve cooked for them so youve shown youre not a hopeless ape youre most likely at home and i hope you brushed your teeth before them coming over and showered properly that day dried off with a clean towel put on deodorant amp cologne and put on clean clothes theyre eating the same food as you who is going to care about some daal onion or garlic breath if you both are eating the same thing i know people might avoid those dishes preemptively on a date especially an early one so maybe have a palletcleanser or mint on the side or even make a joke about the fact that yall is breath might not be great after the meal but the fastest way to someone is heart is through their stomach i dunno im awkward and cheesy and own it now

621	1	indians were allowed to become citizens at the time of segregation through luce cellar act of 1946
622	1	im legitimately confused as to how you see hindus being victimized but dont also the opposite happening to muslim people regardless i still believe that there is more good on this sub that those random people bashing each other until someone does some actual analysis we are both just subjectively postulating  so ill leave that be is your main argument that people should know more about religions in general then like general knowledge about christianity vs islam vs hinduism im cool with that if it is in direct response to make sure we are differentiated from muslims  im not cool with that i think the reasons matter as well i feel like you dont fully understand my argument about gay people even if you dont say that yes we should kill muslim people i feel like you still want to make sure that people know you particularly are not muslim as opposed to people knowing about the differences in general we might have different ideas about god but i dont know my pakistani friends and share the same ideals ive celebrated ramadan with them theyve celebrated diwali with me my beliefs  be a good person and dont hurt other people nah pretty much the same beliefs if someone did die by not declaring themselves are hindu or whatever if they were given that chance  note that i did say if they were given the chance obviously it is a tragedy however i completely disagree that it is more of a tragedy if someone was hinduother than muslim someone innocent died doesnt matter religion at that point
623	1	do they still have that stupid rule about not having sunglasses in your photos because i cant imagine they have some ai looking for that  has to be them going through our pictures

647	1	dumb question but when you mean auckland do you mean in new zealand
648	1	first those are not classicssecond they are not racist
649	1	interesting ive always thought there must be a filter of some kind but not sure what it looked like i think another factor is that once indians come here and have children there is a realization that their kids may assimilate to a point where they may have minimal ties to the indian culture i think this is a natural response to parents wanting their kids to reflect themselves on a basic level though it does cause conflict and challenges for the kids  american culture has such wide spread influence and appeal the kids are being socialized in this culture by its various institutions school friends media etc are powerful agents in forming identity so i get why these parents may feel threatened i think this is when the cultural differences that some indian parents may not be aware even existed come to the surfacethinking more about what you said in my experience ive been in the west about 40 years  y2k has brought a different crop of indian immigrants than previously many who came are young and single it was after india is market liberalized so they tended to be more familiar with western culture than their predecessors  they came to  america at a time when there is already an established indian community and with many of their peers so they could also choose to just hang out with each other technology has changed to so you now have stronger links and easier access to india another thing is the large influx of south indians due to it from my experience south indians ive met im one myself tend to be more conservative at least on the surface ive seen south indian girls at my daughter is old school wearing bindis every day which is something id never seen growing up and living in the west another dynamic to consider is that the more indians that come here the more ethnic enclaves there are i used to live in one and i saw that it was much easier for desi parents to enforce a lot of the things my parents tried on me when the majority of the community shares your valueswe left that community right around the time kids started high school so dont know if these desi kids ended up pushing back against their parents restrictions

714	1	gtpeople shouldnt have to assimilate and integrateactually that is a bit of a misnomer you see integration means a group is embedded into a larger society is economic and legal foundations assimilation means becoming part of the larger whole so actually two different things immigrants should at the very least integrate and if they so chose they should be allowed to assimilate gti think im right on the money about you not being an exmuslim or a pakistani but ill treat you as if you were one for nowwell again you have no proof so at this very moment it is irrelevant that is like me denying you are pakistani a pointless insult but it looks worse on you than me tbh gtalso nice sidelining of the issue i asked whether you should be forced assimilate and integrate into the pakistani culture values and worldview you didnt make it clear when you wrote that sentence anyways as i said so long as my basic human rights are respected i should be expected to integrate and at least give my children the option of assimilating if i dont personally want to gt if that is one of the key things important for a host country they should definitely not import foreign labor and allow them to live in close proximity to one another good we agree gtjust as exmuslims and other minorities in pakistan should be forced to accept the values of the society is this really a good position for you to hold lol the only catch is you are comparing apples and oranges the individualist rights framework of the west gives you the choice and opportunity to participate in a society at your own volition and if you come from backwards places that dont respect those rights you should be at least educated to that framework gtjust as exmuslims and other minorities in pakistan should be forced to accept the values of the society lol as if those islamiyat classes werent doing that already gtplenty of sikhs and hindus are going through this even the tamest of cases of parents forbidding their children to do xyz are found right here on this subreddit and doesnt make it any less of a problem

804	1	gt even in the us in the desi social circles in college grad school and the professional world a lot of people discreetly ask about caste if it isnt obvious from last name and subtly observe caste lines there arent that many intercaste friendships or relationships especially ones where it is more than one level apartwildly incorrect speculation caste is still prevalent in india but to claim that intercaste friendships are rare in the us is extremely inaccurate you are overestimating the usefulness of last names in predicting castes i have lived in the us as an nri for around 10 years now and my circle mostly consists of recent indian immigrants ie people who are more likely to show caste prejudice never have i been asked for my last name nor did i actually see anyone asking others for it in my presence even if they did it is pretty hard to guess caste from it unless you already know the last name and the caste i still dont know the caste of my all my friends here but i can confidently say that at most only two of them are from my caste all the others are from different castes the only thing we have in common is our mother tongue you shouldnt talk about topics you dont knowand you are missing the point of that comment caste issues may not be present in the us but it certainly has race issues we dont have racial diversity in india so caste issues are more prevalent the point is every society divides itself along some lines you are correct in that we should be trying to reduce these divisions even if every other country has it but pretending like india is the only country which has them is not helpful in any way

816	1	that sub makes it very easy to fathom how there are government backed pogroms against some minority community every few years but seriously the sikh diaspora is to be blamed too so many members of the community have achieved relevance in contemporary media more so than any other desi community but we abandon our struggle once we hit the mainstream our community was chased out of india through mass killings and now we just pretend like our story is the same as all other desi immigrant stories like nah fam i wish these people like jus reign and rupi kaur took a page out of jagmeet singh is book and not abandon the sikh political identity in favor of one that wants to erase our suffering
817	1	it is a phrase no i didnt assume your gender but go ahead assume since you wanna be like that and two it is a sikh related issue you started bringing up taxes lol like okayy
818	1	but in the title it says shes unattracted to this ethnicity
819	1	gt just look at the scrawling on the walls of ancient relicsthe reason this happens is because people dont recognise their value a person who knows that a pillar is 2000 years old and contains one of the earliest inscriptions of their mother tongue will treat it much better than a person who merely sees it as one of the 100 pillars in their local temple this lack of education is not a reason to stop the theft or to stop trying to get back what is stolen from usgt before staking claim to what other have stolen yes surprise i acknowledge that colonial powers engaged in theft the indian state must first learn to value and maintain what it currently has within its own bordersso the thieves will be arbiters of when we are mature enough to get back what is stolen from us

829	1	gt incel gt accusation of saying sex is bad gt patriarchal misogynist gt girls dont want you losergt incel fantasies all these personal insults and accusations yet you claim there is no butthurt lol i didnt even bring up purity of muslim women i simply made an observable and rational point about non muslim south asian girls being more  promiscuous than their muslim south asian counter parts the fact that indian hindus so often complain about indian girls preferring whites paints a very telling picture you rarely find the same sentiments in south asian muslim men if we think about it further it a culture places so much value on piety that they make their women cover up that culture is going to have far more women who are less promiscuous that in no way means that a subset from those women will rebel hard against that cultures norms but that subset doesnt negate the fact that more from that culture will not be promiscuous ill extend an olive branch to help you understand non muslim indian culture prizes piety as well although to a lesser degree in this scenario girls raised in non muslims south asian culture on average will be less promiscuous than their white american and european counterparts who dont much value in piety i honestly dont know why you people are losing your shit over such a non controversial rational position especially when you dont think sex is bad why not simply own it lol

861	1	are the big communities of indians made up of recent immigrants 1st 2nd or 3rd generation americansi dont exactly share their views it seems like a minor and insignificant issue but i can understand where the resentment comes from perhaps those same people were discriminated against i heard in america there used to be gangs targeting indians called the dot bustersi think all diaspora groups naturally acclimate to the dominant group over time keeping a few superficial elements is fine by me but i dont think it should be put on a pedestal with a sign saying nonsouth asians dont touch i think everyone should be able to participate in cultures superficially or not i dont carejust so you know it wasnt me who down voted you haha

867	1	your example doesnt check outwhen a riot occurs surrounding businesses can be destroyed they dont specifically seek out asian businesses asians happen to set up businesses more readily in black caste neighborhoods and any business gets destroyedwhen riots occur around the world the same thing happens but when black caste involved it is about black and intentional targetingyellow vest riots right now no one calling them thugs or saying their seeking out businesses riots are eruptions firestorms your bias is showing maybe you should save that how many desisikh have been killed by the white caste in the usa them actually seeking you specifically out yet this is what you say why do some of you despise us this is inexcusable but rare so why the animosity
868	1	damn yall eat fried roti or what

875	1	gtim not talking to you anymorewait i thought i was the one who was triggeredi cannot speak for the experiences of others but i do not appreciate you speaking for the experience of all desis your parents may have been abusive but not every desi parent is you dont get to speak for my experience or every desi is experience this is why you are being confronted by methere are white parents that abuse their children also they are just as despicable as the desi parents you are referring to either explain to me why i should despise the abusive desi parents more or stop wasting my time

879	1	not saying i couldnt get dates in australia just saying it looks to be harder compared to the us dating is about odds not simple binaries to that end not every guy has to be a jacked tall dude to make the odds worse  a lot of girls ive talked to also said they liked australia cause the guys are hotter than anywhere else and lol of course skin color matters trying to not to be patronizing but this is like a white liberal saying race doesnt matter anymore after the 2008 us election you can only imagine skin color does not matter much in dating speaking from privilege  plus white guys clearly are much lighter than the average indian unless you are comparing sunbaked white dudes with punjabis again its not a matter of skin color ruling you out it is making it harder  especially relative to the us looking around and seeing a couple of dark skinned dudes with hot gfs doesnt negate that anyway it is all moot cause it looks like i wont have to go to australia anyway
880	1	httpsmediabiasfactcheckcomindiatodaygt india today reports international news with low biased wording and they source properly to credible mainstream media sources such as reuters overall we rate india today high for factual reporting and a least biased news source for international news m huitsing 952017

887	1	the people who adopted you were racist to you then why did they adopt you in the first place
888	1	that sounds odd to me tbh churches can be flexible these days i reckon you should do some investigation into it perhaps get married at another church which will accept you both i think k that is an acceptable compromise and agree you shouldnt have to convert for marriage
889	1	yeah thats my experience as well im back in india for now and ive met a lot of people from hyderabad and ap and they all speak telugu
890	1	i could just as easily say it to your face no big deal for me either waygt i literally never said that you needed imperialismsay what you want but our lives wouldnt be anything like what they are today if it wasnt for imperialism tbh copy and pasted word for word looks like you think we needed imperialism to have a decent standard of living quit backtracking it only makes you look like even more of a pussy if that is even possible at this pointgt again you have a preconceived notion as to what a desi who hates himself looks like doesnt mean youre right it just means youre biased and have a tendency to stereotypemy guy if you defend people who oppressed your ancestors or say you hate your culture it is not a huge reach to think you hate yourself this has nothing to do with stereotypes or preconceived notions i dont even know of any stereotypes regarding selfhating desis im just going by all the bullshit you choose to type out you can act as desi or as undesi as you want i dont care and that is irrelevant to what im saying but in regards to your views stop being surprised if you get called out for being selfhating if a white person held those views hed be called out as a racist it is only right that desi with those same views would be selfhating
891	1	yep it does just was wondering if a reason your parents are more relaxed to say is because they might have grown up here
892	1	same here i think the reason i have so much freedom is because my parents trust me to be responsible  basic things like no drugs no overspending etc that i choose to follow myself im sure id have some of my freedoms taken away if i did things that were toootally out of line
893	1	its a shame that he makes fun of indians and calls them janitors ethan can go fuck himself

903	1	south indians are not necessarily conservative per se compared to north indians it is just that the more conservative ones are the ones who go to it there are plenty of young privileged south indians living in cities like bangalore chennai even kochi who are into music fests comic cons film festivals standup comedy have tattoos etc all started in the past decade or so but then again these guys live a comfortable life in india so there is no incentive to go to the west and deal with all the shit that comes from being a minority it is the sort of more conservative relatively poorer middle class indian that immigrates to the usa where you basically trade racism for material comforts the more urban hip indians have zero incentive to immigrateas india develops economically migration will gradually slow down and more indians will come to the western world purely for studies and tourism like what happened with the chinese instead of looking to immigrate back in the 90s the idea of going for holiday outside the country was unthinkable you just went to immigrate but so many of my friendsacquaintances now go to europe or the states every year on vacation heck i went to coachella this year for vacation

914	1	its not even close to being as codified and rigid in pakistani society i cant speak on whatever your experiences are as an indian muslimsikhism and islam both vehemently reject these practices but off course since practitioners of both religions in south asia have hindu ancestors certain practices will seep through classism exists all around the world but i was genuinely shocked by seeing casteism at play in the united states in this day and age and yeah no wonder most dalits ive come across in the us have converted to islam or christianity to escape that cycle of subjugation

923	1	im with you brothersister i am too but folks need a boogeyman to point their problems towards that and there are a few people who genuinely dont think you can be racist towards white people youre right in what you said but like my initial comment pointed out any type of defense of white people is usually met with a very small percentage of folks accusing you of wanting to be white white worship etc
924	1	yup i would also say look at chinese immigrants that have the same experience in san francisco bay area there are 4th5th generation but they all still speak mandarin because of chinese school
925	1	indian women like pale skin men indian men like pale skin women almost everyone likes paleskin people its science when the turks invaded and usurped the roman empire byzantine they were tannishbrownish people now the majority of turks in turkey are pale skin because the turks took all the greecoroman women as war wives most black people like pale or lightskin people too you cant control the brain most people love pale whiteskinned people they are simply more attractive there is nothing we can do about it

951	1	this is a good point although the goal is not marriage and if it does become a goal it will be years down the line as far as the customs and traditions go im not a religious man and have distanced myself from that aspect significantly over the last few years i have always feared that i am acting impulsively and just am lovestricken i have feared that me going through this is shortsighted and will reap consequences i may or may not be equipped to handle but its been almost 3 years at this point and i have never been more connected to a person in my life and if this is a mistake it should be one i should risk because every time i visualize a future where i do things in accordance with my parents wants i see a miserable version of my self that is a mere shell of a man that i could have been had i pursued my fullest potential idk this shit is so fucking hard
952	1	i think there is a real problem in redefining words like caste depending on the context that it is being used in you seem to define casteism as prejudice while your european husband may define casteism as the systematic oppression and exploitation of a subgroup of people based on a particular familial heritage some gujarati brahmin family living in the us isnt exploiting untouchables in india by observing brahmin customs in the privacy of their home and while it is prejudiced to want your child to marry a brahmin it is as prejudiced as a white father wanting his daughter to marry a white man if what youre referring to is a kind of prejudicial classism the uk historically and even to a certain extent today was structured along strict social hierarchies

957	1	gtthe only responsibility any citizen has to the nation state is to follow the laws if they are involved in breaking the laws they get to go to jail you cant and shouldnt force someone else is values on others values and laws are not the same thing i value different things than you you shouldnt have to integrate into a society where your view is the minoritythat is all fair but that is what i meant when parallel societies shouldnt be created gtsince youre supposedly an exmuslim and a pakistani which i doubt that you are but lets suppose that you are would you like to integrate into pakistani society and adopt their worldview culture and valueswell you dont really have any proof that i am not so i think it would be a more productive use of your energies to converse with me as if i am what i say i am on the tin i mean there are of course people who leave islam who are also pakistani or are you one of those conspiracy guys i am sorry i think my freedom of belief as a fundamental basic right should come before any integration to larger pakistani society now if my beliefs were hurting people like fundamentalist mormons then that would be an issue but so far only the feelings of some people like yourself are hurt somehow for some reason gtgo to jail if you break the law pretty basic concept closed communities arent magically above the law whoa we agree on something for once gtthe kind of people we are talking about are economic migrants they didnt come for the society and values those people shouldnt be allowed in the first place but if they are here they should be educated or forced to accept the values of the society gtnot exactly a free society if you can go to jail for voicing the wrong opinions but thats besides the pointthat is a strawman but wegtif you dont want people to living in their own communities make it illegal for people from the same background to move into the same neighborhoods thats how you create adjacent structuressingapore does this to great success  cant complain reduces communal tensions and promotes assimilation it is a problem when those communities dont give their members freedom to do what they want

963	1	i honestly just dont understand people like you like what goes through your mind when you see someone who is hurting admitting to their faults and your advice is basically yep youre fucked upgo get therapy to not be fucked up that is such a blanket statement this response is to this and the one below saying that it is the individual is fault again yes all of our shortcomings are our own faults at the end of the day no signs that you empathize and hey congratulations for admitting that it is shallow no words of encouragement of how to love yourself no acceptance yes literally the person admitted that they dont like themselves well done on pointing it out it is sad that this person doesnt like themselves share a way that you overcame something about yourself this person probably does need therapy and i agree with your advice but there are so many ways of saying that while being kind and understanding you obviously have the right to be whoever you want to be but damn dude it doesnt take a lot to get your point across while being respectful
964	1	i dont think there is that many persians and northern indians an hour north of northern idaho man
965	1	ok when it comes to intimate choices and decisions i believe that people have the right to make the choices they pleaseno matter what their reasons might be if an indian woman wants to date marry a white man i support her right to her reason might range anywhere from todd is my spiritual soulmate and were destined to be together to im marrying outside my race because indian men are scum her reasons are irrelevant in this situation because its an intimate decision and her choice is hers onlydo i always like or support it of course not but the way i see it her choice doesnt affect me my happiness or my wellbeing so i have no say in what she does might i judge her for it you bet i will might i think shes being stupid in doing it of course but will i advocate that she marry within her culture no its not my place to make that call best case im indifferent to it worst case its good riddance to bad shit
966	1	gt desi women love competing against each other in friendship circles especially for a desi guy or a guy in general ive seen women end entire friendships over jealousy for a man who is a wet dream to bring home to the parentsim sure this infighting is common in the aunty circles but do people in our generation really compete for guys to bring home that is such a weird concept to me there shouldnt be any competition since the dude is only gonna be able to be in a relationship with one of them
967	1	lol my mom did the same then theres always the sheila auntys son got a 100 in math science and english why didnt youya our parents really know how to kill our excitement
968	1	poophole loophole
969	1	i spent time with my grandfather back in maynothing will ever compare to teaching my grandfather all the cool toolswidgetsapps his new smartphone can do simple things like setting up email weather updates and voice automation invokes a childish thrill among these men and women who have personally seen a rebirth of a nationtechnology may seen as a incremental development to us in western countries but the vast population of the world is experiencing something very new and very lifechanging
970	1	nah be its the use steroids but say its tofu army
971	1	im shooting like 5 so prob not
972	1	not really and if they do its not as prominent as desi culture in the us if youre a blue collar worker you still get the same respect as someone whos in the medical field by white people and americans in generali cant say the majority of desis would treat each other with the same respect in those positionsyou should go find that thread from a few days back about how being poor and desi has affected peoples lives youll see a lot of users who grew up that way ended up distancing themselves from the desi community due to their statusmaterialist obsession
973	1	finally someone else who enjoys strong black coffee
974	1	agree he has no real talent except racism
975	1	brown twitter isnt racist theres black twitter white twitter nba twitterscottish twitter its a slang term for a group on twitter if you dont understand western slang you shouldnt try to comment about how its racist lol and again bollywood blatantly steals western music and movies without even acknowledging it tpain didnt even know there was a sample yet he still acknowledged it and is getting it cleared lmao
976	1	again how can you decide which person had a harder life maybe my difficulties might seem simple to you but to me they were hard to overcome i am not arguing they dont work hard if money is their problem waive their entire tuition and make others pay for it money can be earned later in life but if you want someone to sacrifice their seat to someone else that is where you are downplaying his hardworking in life
977	1	most discriminated against may be a bit of a stretch i would definitely make the case for most disenfranchised considering that literally no political party or other prominent group cares about us

981	1	montana is a nice place would love to live there one day
982	1	i love how offended they are over a black dude using the term brown twitter but our gora buddy and his followers ie pewdipie have basically been waging an online war against tseries and poking fun of indians and none of them have said a word
983	1	any of my creative brothers and sisters tryna write something up ive got a few good ideas
984	1	yes it is broad as fuck i work with a team what i do is called eda data preprocessing understanding what is the objective for the project data science isnt always about creating model from scratch but using existing algorithms to solve and predict things i work in an insurance company most of the time we use linear or random forest depending on the datasets i have to decide with the team if we have time to change the acurrancy or we just gonna use the existing algorithm it isnt always research with lot of free time
985	1	solid insight
986	1	agreed on movies its not typical asian rom coms that have vast appeal in the us its the stuff with unique aesthetics miyazaki or great story and directing  korean moviesbollywood certainly doesnt produce that caliber outside of niche movies nothing in india is as good or as visually sensational as the films that cross over from east asiai think this is changing slowly then rapidly shows like sacred games are pretty popular internationally when india is developed enough in 10 or 20 years to make those on the reg the impact on film or vr or whatever will grow rapidly as language is less of a barrier
987	1	unless they do it and theyre only doing it to give out dawaa s

1002	1	yea but if they were actually all indian that wouldve been impressive
1003	1	the difference is people arent systemically discriminated against for wearing glasses having different hair styles wearing certain clothes etc people are being discriminated against for how dark their skin is skin lightening continues to enforce the narrative that dark skin isnt good and that impacts people who both do lighten their skin and those who dontadditionally most people dont wear glasses as a fashion statement we need them to seefunction it is a very different comparison
1004	1	congrats bro pretty impressive for a old man like you keep going and despise all the limits plus stretch that gorg body of yours any room for the hakathe true test of your abilities
1005	1	sweet home alabama
1006	1	python and data science goes hand in hand bud edit lol getting downvoted by the person i replied to cant accept the facts
1007	1	im disappointed to encounter so much unrestrained misogyny and regressive patriarchalnationalist sentiment in a purportedly neutral space like this what youre accusing her of is probably untrue and predicated on this antiquated stereotypical view you seem to hold of subcontinental women even if it was true though i wouldnt blame her if she was only surrounded by subcontinental men like you who hate women and think that they are property
1008	1	maybe you are used to eat shit
1009	1	i guess the later is where my interest lie
1010	1	so how did you do it what kind of diet and exercise plan did you follow to get down to 125 how aggressive was your cut in terms of daily calorie deficit or weekly weight loss and what did that feel like
1011	1	this is the only correct answer on a thread filled with meaningless anecdotes and needless jibes
1012	1	this is bullshitmalik is a tribeclan in the mahabharata and the name derives from it ill find the exact quote from the gita when i get home
1013	1	i cant be racist im gayfemale i know what its like to be discriminated againstmeanwhile showing their true colors in insidious subtle ways black people have known about this for a long time
1014	1	gallup has consistently estimated a 255 range in the us the last number was at 35 i dont see why india would be any different
1015	1	its like you cant think for yourself
1016	1	he just started asking him some really overly personal questions the whole thing was so awkward
1017	1	benedict anderson came up with the phrase longdistance nationalism to describe the intense feeling of like loyalty to one is home country when in the diaspora there is been a lot of writing about this not only for asians but anytime there are people in diaspora yes completely agree there is a lot of tension for folks trying to accommodate both or multiple cultures that are sometimes very contradictory yes totally agree that there is all sorts of costs associated with it there is lots of post modern and post colonial scholarship i could recommend on this topic if youre interested in reading up on this subject
1018	1	i dont simply trying to relay what becomes of this sub each time something positive about muslims or pakistanis is mentioned
1019	1	i like how you are being down voted the hate against pakistanis and muslims is something else in this sub probably from brigading somewhere
1020	1	not directly related it is just that i realized recently that i there are no nonvegetarian gujarati recipes i was out when i went to india last and everyone told me that you just dont eat meat in gujarat not for religious reasons no one does so it is just not worth the gamble at restaurants it was my first time traveling throughout india in a long time and it was mindblowing how it felt like every restaurant outside of gujarat was nonvegetarian unless it had veg in the restaurant name  i also dont know many indians that had to come out of the closet after adding chicken to their diet but ill admit that is largely fueled by confirmation bias  oh and ive been told that the cow worshipping stereotype stems from gujaratis not sure if that is true or not
1021	1	woohoo i think
1022	1	you got this girl  i feel like a lot of women fear this i know i do

1025	1	i would have added deliciously rich home made ice cream and epic jalapeno grilled cheese sliders    ʖ
1026	1	thankfully the trend has started to change at least in the mental health field the past decade has seen a significant increase going from like 0 to much more lol in research focusing on cultural differences as a variable and it is led to a modified dsm5 cultural competency is now an expected component of training for practitioners as an asian american practitionerresearcher myself i definitely feel almost obligated to really make these issues more salient with the end goal of decreasing stigma and improving treatment for these individuals with a very specific cultural background gosh that sounded like my personal statement when i applied to grad school hahathanks my friend
1027	1	desi men especially have a huge burden we have to wear on our shoulders and have to deal with the stigma in the community that mental health doesnt exist youll never see an adult cultured desi man talk about mental illness or their struggles unless its the i walked 4 miles to school in plastic bags story
1028	1	good luck just heard a success story of a friend who went through chemo and had a smooth pregnancy this year
1029	1	gt the former politically support their right to selfdeterminismcreating their own countrythe khalistani separatist movement is extinct in india even the sikhs dont want a separate homeland the khalistani movement now only exists outside indiawhose right to self determination are you talking about the sikhs living abroad like they are going to drop everything and rush to move back if the separation happens
1030	1	yup sunni muslims this is a big no no they are more lenient towards guys but think girls more like property that other people cant have my cousins in england married sikh girls and had them converted which i was like what the hell to i seriously cant fathom asking someone to do that you know ismailis are definitely not considered muslims by my family because they are probably a lot more liberal than sunnis i have a ismaili friend who married a hindu guy and she is coming to the wedding she also kind of went to a similar ordeal but it was nowhere as intense as mine
1031	1	latinas
1032	1	maybe he changed his viewpoints because of pr and political reasons let is not forget gandhi was more than just a protester he had a political side to him as well
1033	1	you dont call the independence movement terrorism the people that are all fighting india are all terrorists groups they have committed atrocities on the kashmiri people even now a week ago they kidnapped and murdered school children whatver you feel about india there is no comparison that a state run by militants would be worse of for the kashmiri people there are members that support isis in these groups
1034	1	a person doesnt need to be right wing to recognize illegal immigration gangs and drugs from the southern border are very much connected
1035	1	yes expropriation of private entities is very badass
1036	1	do i attract probably white or hispanic what im attracted to hispanic white or arab
1037	1	listen i am notnreally sure what you are trying to argue i simply put out an observation that almost all the desis in hollywood have married white regardless of genderit is a fact that interreligious marriages are a lot more different than intercultural or interracial marriages
1038	1	goats eat pretty much anything too
1039	1	thanks for the suggestion im a female so i usually find other single females at those types of events hehe need to find where the eligible single men are at
1040	1	the article says 63 like how can you be this stupidgtmy husband still doesnt believe it she says i believe it now because it is happened three times so there must be something in what theyre saying it must be true
1041	1	gtthey were just generally very toxic gossipy and full of dramayup indians are egotistical af and i cant even tell some of my friends what i wanna major in without them making comments implying that my major is too hard for me and that they thought i was doing some sort of humanities i wanna be praising my friends not putting them down ya know
1042	1	ooh can we do something similar on this thread i have an abcd friend who is been looking for setup and she isnt on reddit i showed her the fb group but it seems the demographic there is quite young
1043	1	ive always been clear that im of kashmiripunjabi descent not that im kashmiri lmao but youre not pakistaniamerican or part of the community so you wouldnt understand the different subcultures anyways i see you doing some damage control on rexmuslims tryna beef up your fake identity lmaoo
1044	1	gt its about the quality of service you get not because youre unhappy because someone didnt pay enough attention to you so paying attention to a customer is not part of quality of service that makes no sense whatsoever i am in a restaurant to eat food and get good service i am not there to know about their life stories or hardships or to give charity i have always tipped 20 at least sometimes more when its easier to do a roundup instead of calculating the exact 20 so if i get less service than what the server is capable of why i should i tip at the average or higherampx200b
1045	1	just look up does ethnicity matter for dating in the uk on google and this is the first result that pops up of course there wouldnt be any media coverage regarding this because it shows that white men are less desired in the uk which goes against their narrative and propaganda but they cover the results by the same app when it favours white men in the us even if it is marginal are you interested also called firstmet has 3 million likes on facebook as opposed to tinder is 1 million likes and okcupid is 70k likes even their sample 18 million is huge it wouldnt be possible if it wasnt populargtthere are much better statistics research papers studies done that consistently support the rudimentary findings of okcupidplease link statistics which specifically show that indian men not asian men have it bad in the dating scenario in the west
1046	1	your summary of american desi isnt quite right the girl and the main guy actually liked each and the other guy was the territorial friend that had an unreciprocated crush on herthat being said i think the movie was always meant to be more of a cheesy comedydrama than a realistic portrayal of real life
1047	1	slick
1048	1	gtso whats it like being a religious minority in your nation of origin but following the majority religion of the place you where born inerror
1049	1	no they dont this guy is confused i dislike the black and female victimhood narrative while indian men gets shit on by society without anyone thinking its racistmgtow is mainly a response to feminism many black dudes are mgtow also

1051	1	you guys are hillarious always trying to bring up another detraction only the areas in india with sikhs are asking for independence no khaalistani has ever asked pakistan to give them land during partition the formula was that muslim majority areas go to pakistan and hindu areas go to india thus only sikh majority areas would form khaalistan anyways khaalistanis never mention taking lahore or converting pakistanis to sikhism it is always indians who bring this up as if it is a demand of the sikhs lmaoo
1052	1	that is not the point it is already a stereotype in the desi community that kids who grow up in western countries are disrespectful and shitty we dont need bollywood movies adding more fuel to the fireyes i do think these scenes are one of the many reasons contributing to my parents behavior towards mei asked this question because i wanted to know if this was still a thing in bollywood movies or if they have finally grown past that
1053	1	yes at the age of 17 i am very much an incel nice observation
1054	1	im guessing his family disowned him for not being a devout muslim
1055	1	eh i kind of like this answer
1056	1	i think the biggest thing here is finding happiness within yourself and your life and eventually everything will fall into place easier said than done tho
1057	1	even parents are human and sacrificed alot theres so much duty one can handle yet they still did it
1058	1	i said multiple times that changing jobs is not an issue but people shy away from taking risky jobs that they would otherwise have taken because they get deported if they get fired or let go either you are not understanding it or you are trying very hard to redirect the topic back to they can change jobs anyway i am done with this topic and i dont really need your empathy the reason i made those comments is for the benefit of others who may not actually know about these issues i think i wrote enough for the people who are really looking to learn about the topic you on the other hand seem to be here just to say that indian h1bs dont really need anything else they can just rot in the green card limbo for an indefinite period of time
1059	1	that is bullshit logic countries like india and china existed for thousands of years into the bce america has been around say 400 years or so if you dont include all of europe easier to say america is all progressive when it is all new and shit that is like saying all millennials are so progressive and open minded while their grandparents were sexist and racist some millennials arent so progressive and not all grandparents were so sexist and racist it is all relative
1060	1	churchill may or may not have been genocidal but he was the last man standing in europe against the might of the nazis didnt gandhi sleep with little girls
1061	1	wow that is terrible i dont even understand the mental gymnastics that guy went through to conclude that killing his wife was preferable to divorce
1062	1	i like fashion and collecting sneakers kind of a materialistic hobby but i like being creative and talking to people about something that is in no way related to academics or romance ill embrace this hobby a little more
1063	1	thanks for sharing ive heard feeling hopeless is not the most uncommon thing in med school im glad youve been finding things that improved your state of mind ill try to focus on my nonacademic hobbies toofamily stuff has been so hard to deal with during school i only feel better with distance but maybe that is the real solutionwith regards to studying im lazy i spoke with my school is academic advisement office and realized i tend to study at the last minute def gonna make some changes
1064	1	you guts need a good probiotic
1065	1	yup
1066	1	it is near the end of the semester and no one wants to spend winter break alone this is their last 2 weeks to do something about it
1067	1	no she is an indian citizen living the american dream on a visa just like fellow h1b isbut she now made what many h1b is dream of come true marry a us citizen
1068	1	i agree with everything you said but to be fair i know plenty of indianborn parents in the us who support this characterization using the achievements of theirour people as a point of pride i dont like it in either casei sort of see the argument for it to the extent that it invalidates beliefs of a glass ceiling for people of indian ancestry in the us
1069	1	im guessing raees i havent seen it yet is it worth the watch
1070	1	gtavanti school is surprisingly ethnically diverse thoughgtavanti house is unusual among faith schools in that it does not explicitly select pupils on the basis of religion still only a couple of pupils in each year group of 180 or so come from nonhindu families
1071	1	gt they just want to preserve their culture identity ethnos and make sure their grandkids look like them whats so wrong with thatbecause it is not their culture identity and ethnos anymore it is their child is and that decision should 100 be up to the childparenting to enforce values specific to you is narcissistic and cruel a child should be raised to nurture the strengths and preferences they happen to intrinsically have as long as those traits arent deeply harmful to themselves or others the only bias that should be present is that of what parts of life you choose to show them that they then may determine a preference for or lack thereof
1072	1	get out in front of it and explain what exactly there are a disproportionate number of brahmins in north america because we came here to avoid discrimination as i mentioned in another thread an antibrahmin party first came to power in my native state in 1920 it and its successors have held power for the majority of the last hundred years including a monopoly on power since the 1960show do you explain how strongly the law is against discrimination against lower castes to the extent a famous politician was once arrested because he used the common phrase international pariah paraiah is a caste of drummers and by using the phrase he was ruled to have insulted that castehow do you explain that some of the people fighting the hardest to retain caste identities are lower caste and often violently so how do you explain the million differences between subcastes and how one sub caste will completely shun another sub caste even though they belong to the same caste how do you explain that in many cases upper castes served lower caste royal families how do you explain that in modern india castes lobby to be officially labelled as lower castes
1073	1	good job twisting the argument based on your personal anecdotes the linked post clearly bashes pakistan in order to make india seem better but you somehow manage to twist this into pakistanis hating india pakistani americans are not insecure about their heritage but it does seem like indians take any chance they can get to hate on pakistan your post is a prime example
1074	1	ya we hate each other
1075	1	thank you for sharing do you have any specific way i can bring up this conversation im trying to minimize the shock this will give them and i would love to hear more about your brothers situation 5 years is a long time how is his relationship with both your parents and his partner
1076	1	the set point was configured due to some behaviors in the past  no reason that it cant be reset
1077	1	i see it as a literal form of gatekeeping especially with women
1078	1	what is the abbreviated form of fob i am new here and am not familiar with the term cause i think i am one
1079	1	true
1080	1	yes readership has gone up since digital was embraced i still get physical issues if they stand out like the multiversity and doomsday clock
1081	1	that is a thing
1082	1	nah marvel has been killing it in terms of diversity and minority storytelling by hiring writers that actually have an idea of what they are writing about the minds behind kamalas comics are 2 practicing muslim women one of them desi this champions run has 2 white guys if there was just one brown person on the team sayinghold up this wouldnt be as cringey
1083	1	yeah im totally against putting yourself up against a time line for most things in life in general so hearing those words makes my skin crawl haha
1084	1	im actually the opposite haha the thing you gotta realize is that the vast majority of men are hairy women too but thats another story sure some hispanics and asians may be naturally hairless but the majority probably do some self grooming to get there
1085	1	yeah but i deserve my foot stamps for having an american flag on my pick up truck
1086	1	gt a few binge drinking sessions kind of bought out the truth when one of the guys i hung out with in the university said it point black he was like we are at the bottom of the pecking order anyways its just we feel bitter that even our women would not date usnot saying it is justified  but that is it put it together with the fact that fobs are on an average likely to be shorter and the whole negative stereotype about curry smell  bottom of the pecking order thing is real and makes people bitter
1087	1	they do this in china too i remember phelps during the beijing olympics had done it i know james harden and ryan anderson have also done cupping before it is probably quackery but i know some athletes feel theyve found benefits from it
1088	1	good on your parents
1089	1	thinking of it now i think the concept of culture is overrated it is not uniform and everyone is culture is different from one another our culture is def not the same as our parents culture and for western born desis our culture is comprised of a lot of western aspects with some indian influence whereas for indian immigrants it is purely indian unless they are from metros it is never the same a lot of ideas traditions beliefs change within generations and hence culture is different and people adopt the values and norms of the present time they are living in not of the past so when people say others dont know their culture i guess they dont realize that they are different people with a different agenda and influences their shared ancestry doesnt mean anything there i say instead of people blaming others for not purely tuning into their culture or if insecure about not being x enough just live and let live people have their version of culture anyway
1090	1	swarajyamag describes itself as a right wing media outlet and its explicitly probjp its headline magazine cover is literally demographics are changing warning people to beware the rising muslim population its featured numerous articles supporting typical hinduvata causes minimizing hindu violence against minorities defending brahmanical politics and in the case of this article pushing the idea that many scientific advances can be tracedconnected originally in some way to a hindu ampx200b
1091	1	lmao no the only word i can think of that start with g with a j as the third letter is gujarati lol
1092	1	is it possible to learn this power
1093	1	you ever been on a trump supporter forum they do not distinguish at all they have a blind hatred for non whites it is a cult level brainwashing but these guys are not capable of telling the difference between a desi and a latino to them were all the same and that is bad
1094	1	its not my favorite thing either but as a south asian american living in the southern us i know that a lot of nonsouth asian americans including some east asian americans like to say that we smell like curry and stupid shit like that so i feel like its more to poke fun at that than to be selfdeprecating
1095	1	it is a naive world where youre not concerned about the appearance of being gayjust like as a 20something dude in a small indian city you could take your neighbour is kids out for ice cream no problem but you could never do it in the us because pedophilia
1096	1	i wasnt trying to imply you were uncritical of gandhi as i said before even his indian contemporaries who were familiar with his spiritual beliefs considered his behavior inappropriate and sexist so grief or religious beliefs does not justify his actions not that i think you are excusing his behaviorgton march 16 1947 nirmal kumar bose one of gandhis closest associates wrote a letter to kishorlal g mashruwala another of gandhis close colleagues saying when i first learnt about gandhis experiment in which a girl took off her clothes and lay under the same cover with him and he tried to find out if any sexual feeling was evoked in him or his companion i felt genuinely surprised personally i would not tempt myself like that and more than that my respect for women would prevent me from treating her as an instrument in my experiment
1097	1	i dont think that it is wrong to celebrate christmas just a waste of time and energy if you arent christian i am not one of those who gets crazy if someone wishes me a merry christmas but i will always ask why the f a non revert muslim has a nativity out in their yard or a christas treet stockings etc in their hime simply put why do we have to be so extra about it or feel the need toi grew up in the us as well i was asked the same question i simply said my family doesnt celebrate christmas and that was the end of it there were only like 7 or 8 brown kids at my school including my sister and we were the only muslims this was also early 2000s during 911 i had an orthodox jewish classmate who simply asked to be excused from the activities and that was it one time i decided to get excused with him and felt a lot better about myself he even taught me about hannukah and the dreidel and i taught him about eid then we went back to class and joined our friends i am not saying everything was easy for me but back then my classmates definitely did not judge me as even some muslims do to me now when i dont do christmas activities with themi know a lot of jewish families who dont do as much as desis regardless of religion do during christmas i think the problem is that so many of them have no confidence in their own identity that they feel the need to double down on it no matter how dumb it is
1098	1	rofl cope
1099	1	why do you wish youyour parents were white my guess is you have shitty parents and you think it is because of their race or culture when they likely would have been bad regardless

1103	1	pretty sure its asian men in general not just south asian men edit checked and confirmed
1104	1	the reason they like asians is because they fetishise them for being petite submissive and generally easy to dominate they dont see them as anything other then a maid who they can fuck
1105	1	perhaps they dont mind trumps corruption and his america first rhetoric i was talking to my uncle about us politics and he said he supports trump for putting americas interests first  then again he is a textbook example of corruption in indian politics he used to work as an adviser to some minister before retiring several years ago now he does under the table work for some politicians and is never willing to explain his work his perks include free travel to various indian cities and a free car with a driver that his family can use
1106	1	just because theyre jokes doesnt mean they cant be offensive or that they dont contribute to make racist attitudes more palatable the daily stormer a neo nazi editorial site actively promoted pewdiepie because of his stances like you can pull off humour that is in problematic areas if you do it well but he doesnt do that sorry if i dont think paying poor dudes to say death to all jews is the height of comedy saying edgy shit isnt automatically funny just because its edgy but thats his crutchi think its on you for thinking racism only means youre a member of the kkk and anything less than that isnt worthy of criticism racism exists on a spectrum im not saying that his actions mean peediepie is a neonazi with a shrine of daddy hitler in his closet like youre getting angry over a selfconstructed strawman youre getting all worked up over just a drop of criticism i think his actions are worthy of criticism because they play off racist attitudes without really doing anything actually more sophisticated with it and i think its possibly indicative of some racist leanings the dude has as exemplified by his usage of the n word
1107	1	definitely desi all people of hindu origin and faith are desi by being hindu you are inculcating a lot of indian traditions and rituals and other stuff which nonindians dont indian muslims dont understand that a lot of rituals they do at their weddings is of a hindu origin think of it at one point everyone on the indian subcontinent were considered hindu hindu traditions have influenced everyone on the subcontinent
1108	1	gtin an interview with abc news george stephanopoulos asked trump about the content of the speech asking him to respond to the charge that he had not made sacrifices trump began by suggesting that hillary clinton is campaign staff had written the speech according to khizr they wrote it themselves26 and said i think ive made a lot of sacrifices  ive created thousands and thousands of jobs tens of thousands of jobs built great structures ive had tremendous success i think ive done a lot2336 he went on to describe financial help he has provided for veterans causes37 trump also remarked on ghazala is presence on stage implying a connection between her silence and gender roles in islam if you look at his wife she was standing there she had nothing to say she probably  maybe she wasnt allowed to have anything to say you tell megtinsult verb speak to or treat with disrespect or scornful abusewhere did trump speak with scornful abuse to the islamic faith
1109	1	well i do want to take care of my parents  i understand both americanpakistani culture but i would definitely not leave my parents if they need help  i do have an older brother who lives 2 hours away younger brother moving out of state for school and a sistermarried who lives close  we all kind of have to help our parents because that is how they raised us  i am looking at houses that are 1020 minutes away from them and my work  i dont think my parents would necessarily hate me but they would definitely not approve of dating girls as much  once i mention a girl they will most likely jump to marriage talk which i am not ready for  off course they want me to get married and have kids etc
1110	1	10 didnt answer i wonder why

1114	1	well shit
1115	1	first off i realize the error of my comment not all sikhs do this and i am incredibly sorry for implying that secondly yes the indian government or factors of the government were complicit in the abuse of sikh human rights at certain times of history ie 1984 as an american i am not beholden to any glorification of the indian government or the radical elements that occur within it if i did i myself would be biased and will apologize for that as to the rest of the argument i could say the same that you are painting a rosytinted view of sikh separatists the khalistani movement has committed acts of terror oft considered reprehensible indeed acts of reprisals on innocent bystanders akin to hate crimes in the us after 911 are also reprehensible but it nevertheless should not water down the crimes of what is considered by most a terrorist movement by most here is the issue in canada a plethora of sikhs glorifies the khalistanis akin to how indians in india do with indira gandhi or yes bhagat singh which is a problem as to a certain extent this is a deification of terrorists thus when a violent terrorist movement has been intertwined with a political cause for secession in an overseas diaspora why do you think people get upset indeed most sikhs in general even back in the 80s did not support secession so me saying that the khalistani movement is vicious does not make me an rss or any other type of radical it just makes me acknowledge one part of facts that i am saying a lot of canadians americans and indians cant even acknowledge which is this exact issue that people are getting mad over indeed recognition of the crimes against the sikh people is also in order but i resent the fact that you are making me out to be some villain that hides and protect lynchers against a valiant and heroic cause because like all things in life there is clearly some gray areas and areas that simply bring up sore points in history as well as others that i believe are not okay you think i whitewash the crimes against the sikh people i dont and i dont want to express it that way the hurt and harm that happened in that nightmarish time do demand reconciliation my friends are sikhs and some of them have relatives who dealt with that very same issue yet for you and indeed a small minority of others like you to whitewash the crimes of the khalistani movement is considerably also unfair unjust and yes downright bad i have always admired and respected your people and your faith i am a south indian that eats paratha listens to bhangra and watches jusreign i love punjabi and the sikh culture especially the community in canada it is just that hindu or sikh i sincerely just want the crimes of all sides to be acknowledged and move forward in the spirit of peace and harmony
1116	1	east indian is an outdated term possibly created to differentiate between indians from india and people from the west indies
1117	1	we are not the most discriminated against i dont know where you got that from we are discriminated against but on a significantly different level than other ethnicities with deeper histories in the us eg native americans and black americans
1118	1	gt i am saying every hindu needs to speak up about their identity so it becomes mainstream knowledge hindus and muslims are not the same religious groupsfor this to happen the hindus need to practice their religion in public in greater numbers so that they can stand on their own rather than competing against muslims that is crab mentality

1139	1	if that is the case i dont understand the need to bring that up on a discussion about his early life racism we all acknowledge his wrongdoings the point i was making is that we should focus on those and not the ones that are false like the claim of his racist views never changing

1177	1	gt rather than the indentured servitude that takes place in the usa with the whole green card backlog situationindentured servitude a bit of an exagerration eh the indians impacted by green card backlog in the us are mostly employed in the tech industry and the jobs are well known for significantly higher overall compensation they can easily save enough money each year and return to india which has significant tech industry of its own as wellnow if you think about the desis from pakistan bangladesh sri lanka nepal gt what tech industry are they going back to there is not fall back option yes it is kind of sad to have to wait for a long time for the us green card but to call it indentured servitude is a disservice to so many of other workers who get stuck in human trafficking and other much worse situations
1178	1	exactly ive seen people getting married because it was the right time and to be fair majority of them are successful that is what they latch on to

1183	1	yeah that could def be it that is also what fueled me to write it we need to reappropriate stereotypes and cast them in a more honest complex and ultimately human light it is funny and sad that immigrants are often mocked for being incredibly hard workers willing to do just about any job for their own betterment and the betterment of their families
1184	1	my two brothers are basically 2 extra dad is

1187	1	lol dude keep telling yourself that you see nothing wrong with your parents requiring that she convert but somehow think that her family is wrong in worrying that you will convert her i dont think her family should have threatened you but what you did by converting her is neither going to help the wider muslim community or any future couples involving a muslim

1191	1	wtf that is stereotyping
1192	1	yeah i dont understand it either but then again back in my dad is day most of the people in the british government were alive when we were a colony and directly profited off our suffering  also the uk was super rascist towards brown people in the 70s and 80she still doesnt like the fact that people revere churchill in the uk while my grandfather nearly starved to death because of his policies or the general apathy the british have for their horrible history i mean people either dont know anything about its attrocies like the genocides and concentration camps or dont carealso the us had much better offers and he was able to get a full ride for his phd
1193	1	interesting the majority of mallu christians i know here in the us are syromalabar catholics
1194	1	those are not the same democrats or republicans most southern democrats went over to republican side after the passage of the civil rights act both parties further went through a ideological realignment after nixon is southern strategy  simple questions for you  which party currently has the most nativist which party  has the most people that doubted if barack obama was born in the united states which party had 4 open racists running for office in this year is mid term election an election where one of them was able to hold onto his office i could on and on with many more examples  the point is the neither party is ideologically same as it was in the 1960s
1195	1	wanting india to be an equal society for both genders and take action against sexual harassment and assault is not the same as having opinions about indian politics
1196	1	nah regardless of the situation it is cool

1198	1	all of our cultures are derived from india pakistanbangladesh i dont know much about countries like nepal and bhutan havent been around long enough to where our identity is easily distinguishable like i said my grandfather fought for the indian army during the partition he considered himself pakistani but his nationality didnt change halfway through his life my dad used to think we were different but now understands that were all the same because of historyand thats coming from an almost 60 year old traditional muslim lol my guyanese friend also considers himself desi because the culture is similar   nobodys saying to simply identify as indian but moreso to understand that being called india has a factual basis behind it but genuinely asking whats the difference in what you call preaching kumbaya to identifying as a desi in a sense it seems like thats a form of solidarity amongst some south asians  who are of indian descent
1199	1	gtyoull never pass for white bhaiwhat prompted that personal attack bhai did i say i want to pass as white did i say i support white nationalists did i say i want to wave american flags rather than responding to my argument you decided to attack me if you want to debate come back with a valid point not rhetoricampx200bi do not want to pass fort white i do not want to change my name burying my head in sand would mean i do not see what is happening around me but just listen to like minded people which is the problem with people nowadays  living in an echo chamber my neighbors voted trump yet they invite me to christmas dinner and joined me in bursting firecrackers on diwali i talk to them they respect my opinions and they respect mine we disagree on things but we do not attack each otherampx200bthe first line of the article reads asgt  reported hate crimes in america rose 17 percent last year the third consecutive year that such crimes increasedso that means 2018 2017 and 2016 had increases in hate crimes should we call obama a xenophobe as well with that logic since he was the president in 2016 noampx200ball i am saying is stop picking sides and start thinking logically laws cannot be applied selectively

1202	1	forcing a relationship to happen isnt a crime and neither is it as severe as the op is making it out to be if the post had been my parents disowned my sister and cut her off financially kicked her out of the house  then i would obviously say the parents are flat out in the wrong however this isnt the case here
1203	1	hi
1204	1	what im advocating  that we should focus more on nonblack minorities and the racism theywe face i hate the fact that women and blacks whine so much that almost all attention is given to their problems and many of their problems are not even the result of racism or sexism but rather their own failures which they refuse to admit

1217	1	you cannot justify one form of imperialism and at the same time disparage another one most everything youve labeled about developing india can most definitely be applied to the english the british introduced their schooling system they built cities beautiful monuments and in fact the very seat of indian democracy the rashtrapati bhavan is built by the british most of the rulers under the raj were native born indians that pledged their loyalty to the british white anglo saxons made but a fraction of the raj as the majority of the population of rulers in india were native born the raj however maintained control gton top of that the muslim rulers of india were usually indian themselves the mughals and even the delhi sultans had significant rajput or otherwise south asian ancestrythat may well be the case but the mughals themselves never considered themselves to be indians they always put their own turkishmongol origins up front and considered themselves foremost as suchgtmughals may have slaughtered hindussikhs destroyed temples etc but the wealth that they plundered or received as tribute was of a smaller scale than the british and purely circulated within indiaby weakening the roots of a civilization with the express goal of ending it you are do no one any favors the nazis created the autobahn pulled germany out of a economic crisis and did a whole lot of good for the nation of germany but its morally debased ideas nullify any kind of economic benefit that it may have contributed to the mughals or any imperially ambitious people therefore in the same boat mughals are no different than the british
1218	1	do you mean sukh knight
1219	1	i respect your stance but logically i cant support it
1220	1	namaskara yeah you can just throwing it out in the open as well in case some other kannadigas south indians find it useful checkout this youtube channel called hebbar is kitchen her channel is amazing to learn to cook south indian dishes in a simple and effective manner
1221	1	the food definitely needs to be packaged differently i feel like once someone hits on a format that is just right itll spread like wildfire too soon maybe it is a minitandoori oven place that goes for a pseudokbbq experience or a tiffin joint with amazing chutneys or somewhere that goes all in on street food im thinking curry up now but better there is so much room for innovation and it is a shame that there are so many doctors and engineers who missed out on their calling to revolutionize global indian cuisine
1222	1	thanks
1223	1	i really dont know but i dont think they are since the only babber as in babber sher ive met were from the punjab region both sides of the border ive met some pastun and hazara but didnt hear baburbaber but my contact with afghans or even pakistanis of the frontier is limited
1224	1	are you making a point or is this a juvenile attempt at whataboutism
1225	1	gt i have to admit i really liked pewdiepie back in the days when he made letsplays of mainly horror games this rape obsessed pewdiepie httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrqncgq9c7i
1226	1	more down to ayoade than anything he is a good newsreader otherwise

1229	1	and indian girls back home dont
1230	1	fox news must be destroyed seriously
1231	1	yes i think judging fobs is something we really do im just gonna say it having a deep indian accent will really hurt your ability to make friends with people who have been running away from stereotypes all their lives
1232	1	i actually dont see that a whole lot in the sub in fact i usually hear how hindus dominate the sub and they are being dicks to the muslims  something i really dont agree with it i dont conflate with being indian and hindu but as a hindu we are not doing the community any favors by saying we are all the same  muslims have a lot of vastly different beliefs than hindus and i think that should be known i only legitimize their argument when i say that its okay to kill muslims which i am not i am saying every hindu needs to speak up about their identity so it becomes mainstream knowledge hindus and muslims are not the same religious groups which we are not   people who are getting killed for looking like muslims are not standing up for what they believe in i think it is common knowledge no one wants anyone killed for any reason by crazies but if someone thinks you are something you are not and gets you killed for that then that becomes a tragedy
1233	1	no but he may have given your mom his lollipop today
1234	1	lactose intolerant
1235	1	afghans are desi imo i believe afghan hindus even existed until like a 100 years ago or something and the mauryan empire back in the day spanned all the way to gandhara
1236	1	imo it is gone to shit since the americans have poured in american humour is very boring
1237	1	where in the states are you im in the sf bay area i hang out with a lot of east asian kids im 17 and they all prefer east asian food obviously  also yes chai tea latte is everywhere and we overlook it cuz we are so used to seeing it tbh
1238	1	a lot of hindu hyderabadis do speak telugu but there is also hyderabadi hindi which most people know
1239	1	although that is finally changing as people like bernie sanders present an alternative that is more in line with the policies of fdr eisenhower and lbj rather than the reaganism that has dominated recently
1240	1	are you above average in height or was the guy on the shorter end
1241	1	its difficult when youre a teenager i genuinely acquired the accent when i spent 1820 hours with american kids playing world of warcraft back in the day i wouldnt say its a good thing i did i did what i had to to not be treated with racism all the time i dont want to be an abcd because im not one and will never be because theres a lot of cultural differences just from the fact that i was raised in indiaim just alarmed that i have to receive the same sort of outsider treatment from my own ethnic relatives who i thought would relate to this more than the people i spend my time with in indiai do want to live here in america though because my interests cultural preferences food preferences are better suited to living here than in india theres nothing to be proud of or feel superior about its just how it is
1242	1	as an adult with enough experience religious fanatics of various groups i no more feel offended i do pity the religious people who blindly follow such practices without questioning their legitimacy just because someone taught such a thing under the pretext of worshipping god but such encounters were one of many reasons that pushed me towards agnosticism
1243	1	im in the exact same scenario but im the 25 yo and he is the 32 yo im the abcd and he is come to the us 5 years ago he a nice guy but were incompatible on a few levels i tried telling my parents that i dont think were compatible but they literally have something to say for everythingon a side note tho what do you guys look for personally before making a final decision i dont know which issues would be the big ones and which ones i should let go also how do you determine if youre compatible enough to marry them in 34 phone calls
1244	1	my dick doesnt care
1245	1	wouldnt trust anything unless you actually go to the location in india for oneself  ive had personal experience donating and the administrator pocketing most of the funds reporting how it was expensed on school supplies etc and no questions asked until i went myself  its very corrupt and policegovernment could also turn a blind eye
1246	1	thats awesome
1247	1	im sure that she is embraced her indian roots but remember this identification of an ethnic group is  a two way street what makes you think that her indian side accepted her we cant take that her indian side accepted her as one of their own
1248	1	lol the methodology is simply that they use reuters good one
1249	1	not gonna lie as a toronto native i thought when people say gta they were referring to grand theft auto for longer than i care to admit
1250	1	of course im around your age and i can tell you for sure that my peers and i are still having discussions about how to reconcile being american and south asian dont feel like youre the only one out there
1251	1	what about him speaking of which where is he
1252	1	yup it is title song was hype vivek oberon was a great actor unfortunately calling out salman khan ruined his career
1253	1	i care
1254	1	no go to dallas houston is full
1255	1	why am i a troll  just because i have a different opinion than you  all youve done is pile on insults and accusations  at least with the other posters we disagreed on our beliefs but reached a somewhat amicable conclusion  im trying to do the same with you  the first paragraph of that is my personal opinion  i put it out because i think you wanted to know how i felt  but the issue remains regardless of my opinion so we should focus on the second paragraph
1256	1	same even got a couple of beautiful ceramic desert bowls for free because i mentioned how cool they were
1257	1	very little ive noticed it doesnt make me as anxious though
1258	1	not all arranged marriage women are like that and not only fobs get arranged marriages
1259	1	according to the us census people from south asia fall under the asian category while people from the middle east are considered white
1260	1	yesss that is absolutely true i typed this up from my phone real quick lmao at how im half desk so i wasnt able to capture everything  but there is so much richness in indian dance and music as well i could write a whole book on all the awesome parts of our culture

1262	1	halleluka
1263	1	fair and lovely
1264	1	my apologies i will fix my post
1265	1	yea this sort of sentiment wont get you anywhere
1266	1	twitters caste problemby thenmozhi soundararajanyep lost me right at the author is name ive heard her talk before although rail might be a better word than talk listening to her youd think that all of india is an oppressive religious casteist society in which poor innocent hapless muslims and dalits are huddled miserably cowering in fear under the boot of the mean old upper caste hidebound hindus every negative aspect about india is dialed up to eleven any positive aspect or mitigating factor is denied or simply ignoredit is not the activist is fault for making those posters it is the pr team is fault for taking a picture with the poster and releasing it into the public domain with jack dorsey coming off as the typical westerner who thinks that he knows what india is all about and what it should be
1267	1	good even if it didnt go well for a second date you went on a date you got more practicebeing comfortable which is a win use that opportunity as a stepping stone to do even better when you get another opportunity you got to do something that a lot of guys on this sub didnt get a chance to do recently
1268	1	can confirm alhamdulillah terrorist incidents have gone down quite a bit in balochistan and other parts of the country
1269	1	not him but his fans made it racialthey literally spammed tseries videos with racial abuse i mean they didnt even leave tseries kids channel which is meant for kids
1270	1	gt almost hear their brain circuits rapidly reconfiguring themselves to comprehend this new reality beats white bois fighting meme wars any dayto be fair that is how it was here in the us in the early 90 is when for the first time the general public got on the internet it was a wondrous place and now you can see even a lot of indians engaging in shit posting and meme wars its a natural progression it seems your maid and cook are just a couple of years away from it too
1271	1	why do desi people want light skin its because south asia was colonized by the british for over a hundred years this is how the region came to correlate color with success and prestige all im saying is that the idea that being fair is better needs to be dismantled because lets be realmost desis are pretty fucking dark so its unachievable for most people im all for people doing whatever they want but if a practice is rooted in unachievable ideals of beauty left behind by colonial influence then it is socially detrimental
1272	1	take a chill pill and develop some sense of humour
1273	1	its normal in the us now perhaps not 1015 years ago but now it is
1274	1	this plus learning something as a hobby versus actually studying it is so different ive just started a history degree and will be specialising in south asian history if all goes to plan and let me tell you doing a whole degree in it is not even similar to that time i read the discovery of india and thought i knew everything there was to know about it plus we need people who are knowledgeable in the arts everyone who consumes any content  movies music literature articles whatever  was taught by someone that needs to be continued if we want to have any kind of culturenot saying artsgtstem or anything both have their place but only seeing artshumanities as hobbies really devalues their importance in our society
1275	1	the bjp it cell is brigading this sub
1276	1	the complexity of indias social structure  its castes varnas jatis religions languages tribes communities  is a minefield to navigate for many indians let alone nonindianshttpsthediplomatcom201811twitterindianliberalismandthetruthaboutcastei dont think the article is in no way defending the caste system but instead trying to give a more comprehensive description of rigid hierarchical systems throughout the world to better understand how to go about dismantling the caste social system in india
1277	1	haha thank you all this anger and resentment towards being indian and my parents isnt worth it i wish i could take their abuse and ignore it but no i yell back its quite ugly i never raise my voice but these damn people drive me to hells edge i love the army so much im so happy about enlisting which is very soon thinking this summer is when i will enlist i dont care about them anymore i genuinely want to enlist this is my destiny anyhoo hows your christmas going
1278	1	gteither way there is always an alternative to being beatthere is but what gives the lasting impressionan example of this is incarceration physical punishment why lock someone up when you can just give them a slap on the hand or verbally warm them  because theyll know whatll happen if they do the same ish againampx200b
1279	1	lol i wouldnt go that far all of my doctors are first gen indians because id still rather see them than a white doctor i think you might underestimate how racial bias might affect your care like black people often have a hard time getting pain medicines they need from white doctors who assume theyre drug seekers white people often act nice but can be very good at hiding their biases until their true colors show
1280	1	you are ignorant and are proud to be so typical low information liberalgt not even clicking but it is either some bs proposed by a pro corporate gop memberthis is an old bill it has not passed so far because of 2 reasons1gt silicon valley companies are lobbying against it the indian american group lobbying for the bill  immigration voicehttpsimmigrationvoiceorg called out zuckerburg in particular for gt which will never pass and anyway never would be signed by racist trump trump supported the billgt or it is some anti immigration measure that heavily restricts other areasno the bill just removes the racist quota system in allocating employment based greencards it does not reduce the numbers overall the previous version leaves the numbers unchanged while this version also removes some other restrictions on greencards for chinese immigrants from that time related to laws passed post tienanmen square protestsand the 2nd reason it has not passed 2gt while democrats purportedly support this bill  it has in the past been termed the most popular bill on the hill  they are holding it hostage in order to get legalization of illegal aliens
1281	1	gt it was only in the colonial era that sign boards began to emerge prohibiting black indians from entering restaurants and various other public spacesi have never heard of that happening in colonial india  can you post some examples of this  most places that prohibited indians prohibited all of them not just ones with darker skin
1282	1	whats the name of that indian soap opera thats number one in vietnam
1283	1	thats true still hopeful our generation will get over this
1284	1	i dont even think most americans care about the religious aspect of christmas lol  they just do literally what you describe plus presents
1285	1	lol okayyou dont understand how polls work and how the electoral college is a lot different the polls were correct in that she won the popular vote but the electoral college doesnt measure popularity the way polls doone of nate silver is possibilities was also that hrc would win the election but trump won the popular vote there were multiple scenarios this scenario if people like you actually learned history gave us bush and gorealso ionteresting that you bring up lgbt rights considering that she said there was a gay mafia trying to push gay marriage upon other people how progressive is she when she supports israel and calls palestinians terrorists she was the only democrat who attended private aipac eventshow progressive are you when naziskkkwhite supremacists members are supporting you this includes david duke richard spencer and steve bannon how progreessive are you when you were on a shortlist for turmp is secretary of state how progressive are you when literally joined up an unjust war and then turn around pretending to be sad that the war happened she is a progressive at home but hard right outside limiting refugees and making it harder while also supporting a precursor to the muslim ban is not a progressive point how are you antiintervention but still publicly support and take sides with terrorists isnt that intervention i know hypocrites have a hard time seeing their own hypocrisy and idiocy but come onprogressives are against the extreme vetting especially when there have been no refugees who carried out any terrorist attacks in the us she follows the poisoned skittles analogy even the demsocs have voiced their concerns about her progressiveness especially when there are many more consistent and better optionshow progressive are you when you limited the regulatory powers that would stop unfair lending as well as cutting progressive funding to things like snap how about the fact that she has won against her primary challenges simply because she has outspent them with her corporate lobbying cash have fun
1286	1	gt does this mean theyre datinghhhow are we supposed to know  they might just be studybuddieswithbenefits
1287	1	hey this post is 50 upvoted how come no protest by you who is brigading this time
1288	1	youre a wannabe gatekeeper acting as if anybody has outside views is wanting to be white so all desi people eat halal no do all muslim people no so why not just go ahead and accuse everybody of wanting to be white if thats the case if youve never eaten zabiha halal or havent been in an a area where it isnt easily accessible then your comments have no merit because you have zero idea of what other peoples lives entail but whatever act like half of the reactionary folks on this subreddit and start accusing other people of white worship or whatever which isnt even real because youre so insecure about your own identity that other people being more progressive or idealistic is a threat to you sorry buddy but not all desi people are the same the sooner you learn not to throw stereotypes and labels at people the sooner youll be more educated you can say whatever you want to me it doesnt change the fact that youre insecure and bigoted
1289	1	sure
1290	1	i can understand it with immigrants if they are new to the country not so much when abcds do this and long term immigrants
1291	1	do you not know what he did while he was chief minister of gujarat  he and his party have never cared about anyone who is not brahmin so this is no surprise to those who didnt have blinders on
1292	1	yeah i know of sikhhindu arranged marriages granted the families had military backgrounds  so probably a bit more progressive than civilians
1293	1	gt the only successful indianborn adult actresssunny leone would like a word with youedit i see emphasis on born even though both grew up abroad
1294	1	its actually the government trying to avoid helping black communities by putting the onus on colleges to ensure that theyre brought out of poverty if we really wanted to help black people achieve great heights then wed start by spending the money and effort to fix the disparities in education and opportunities in public schools in low income areasschools that have high minority populations
1295	1	just been accepted mate i have no clue what to suspect but certainly not thatreally tempted to put myself up
1296	1	ummm in the japanese wife she is the wife of the guy in india he wasnt married to anyone else while she was in japan loved the movie though that last scene where he floats away in the boat made me cry
1297	1	eh i said tan skin not dark skin of course very darkblack skin makes dating harder case black people or some south indians but not a lot of indians who are black skinned most are either tan olive fair or wheatish somewhere in between those i dont think youre gonna get rejected for that

1302	1	yes he was a pakistani hindu ive never met someone like that before thats where the intrigue of his personality stopped though he was an insecure pakistani that constantly felt the need to flex his country even when the conversation was nowhere close to the topic of countriesthis memory stands out to me i was talking to him about how funny the calgary stampede and cowboy culture is and he replied oh in pakistan where my father is from he was one of the best horse breeders do you have horses in india and i was like  im talking about canada he used to have weird conversations like that with me no reference to context at all but somehow trying to flex pakistan for no reasonedit removed the word typical lol sorry that word is a reflex from back when i used to live in india
1303	1	my boss manages 40plus people at my level and hundreds of people below my level i dont need to add to his list of problems any problem that is minor enough for me not to leave i dont need to bother him with any problem that big enough to bring to his attention im better off looking for a new job rather than trying to get the job that im in to changemy problems are my problems theyre not someone else is responsibility to fixobviously this doesnt apply to  especially of the sexual variety but being socially or culturally insensitive is not harassment
1304	1	you sound like the 14 year old since you try to make this personal you dont have a strong argument and thus resort to ad hominem i know hindus in jammu are the majority and mostly likely they vote to stay in a referendum muslims are actually 2533 of jammus populationhttpsenwikipediaorgwiki1947_jammu_massacrespopulation_figures i dont know if youre purposely trying to misrepresent facts it is riduciouls how you think the only alternative to an occupation is an islamic state that is just fearmongering and more dishonesty on your part ampx200b whataboutism doesnt dismiss claims as you have mentioned it has a lot  to do because it is mostly pakistanis making claims for independence  while ignoring what is happening in their door steps  muslim indians  dont say things like that i am in favor of a referendum too but you  have to get everyone in youre always trying to make this an india v pakistan thing and that is why you keep bringing up my background my heritage shouldnt matter in this case i just objectively support freedom for kashmiris also you cant lie to yourself the majority of people in the valley want independence it is not just pakistanis that talk about this indian muslims do not speak on behalf of koshur muslims in the valley that being said an independent kashmir wont even survive because it has  no access to the sea and is land locked just like what would happen  to kurdistan that is your opinion and shouldnt matter you can choose to be indian and wouldnt matter what kashmiris did with their country nepal and bhutan are also landlocked countries yet i dont see india annexing them for their welfare
1305	1	lmao it is funny how you cant stop thinking about her
1306	1	the shah in amit shah is name is not persian shah is a surname used by trader communities it comes from prakrit sahu which means merchant it is pronounced as sah in traditional gujarati
1307	1	not true the earlier language spoken in iranian plateau was elamite if you know sanskrit u can very well understand this language even zoroastrian has borrowed from vedic religion of ancient iran old persian is the ancestor of modern farsi language despite its massive arabification farsidaritajik has retained old persian roots however there is not a single persian loan in ramayana and mahabharataworld is leading indologist michael witzel nothing predates to sanskritprakrit
1308	1	hmm i am going through it soon
1309	1	i think the key is herethe panel concluded that by writing the notes a doctorpatient relationship was established sex between health care professionals and patients in ontario requires the automatic revocation of their licenceso it is not that he engaged in sex it is that he had sex with someone who he was also providing medical care for by definition that is an automatic revocation of their license if he wanted to have sex with her he should have asked her to go to another doctor
1310	1	its when you wake up next to them in the morning and still feel the same way you did the night before
1311	1	i used to work for a company where my boss was from alabama i had to leave because he was so racist
1312	1	dang i have never heard of a desi being homeschooled before that is some next level stuff your parents must have been either extremely paranoid or were narcissists afraid that you were going to escape their controlalso although it can help i dont think college is necessary to socialize honestly you should find what you are good at and try to join some local groups like book clubs sport activities etc you can then make friends through common interests i only say this because i have seen college backfire on people who went there just to party and have a good time not saying this is your only motivation
1313	1	i was talking about the outdated and frankly terrible belief that all hindu bengalis should live in wb and all muslim bengalis should live in bd the whole notion that india should be a hindu only country and that all indian muslims should go to pakistan or bd is a shitty belief too

1321	1	are regular people nonpoliticians haha
1322	1	okay i just looked it up must be exclusively pakistani indian or iranian descent  meaning the donors birth parents are both 100 pakistani indian or iranian so you cant be both iranian and indian i think you have to be either indian or iranian
1323	1	i appreciate the answer but your comment on height made me look through your profile history apparently you are well over 6 extremely pale and built so basically got 2 things vastly in your favor that the average indian guy doesnt and cant get given how many southern europeans are in australia you basically would fit right in in big citiesthe small tinder match rate bump actually makes sense aussie culture seems way more into sports than the us so theyd value that way more

1331	1	it is kind of funny but we fetishized each other for totally different reasons nothing to do with our races we had and continue to have the most lively political debates followed by the best freaking sex and figured that is fun enough to do for the rest of our lives
1332	1	guy with victim complex is calling out me for having a victim complex you would have more of a point if you didnt attack another user for gatekeeping in your first post but sure

1341	1	to clarify white people have nothing to do with being aryan they hijacked the ethnicity of millenia old civilizations because our history sounded glorious and nice to them
1342	1	i see i havent actually seen any abcds at my university use it nor from anyone in general maybe just a fringe minority use it in a degrading way
1343	1	haha that is also true
1344	1	hell yes they do theres definetly some super sexy guys out there
1345	1	for me its more so that the idea of india as a nation is a modern invention and i dont see why i have to consider myself one with people who i couldnt understand and who obviously dont look like me for example im punjabi and i dont feel a close kinship with bengalis i accept that there are multiple indian cultures and ethnicities in india and so i dont feel a need to consider myself to be the same as all of them this is an idea that is very unpopular amongst indians bc it challenges their concept of india and indians as a single nation and peoplegtas i have gotten older and learned about the actual culture more i feel less kinshipdo you think thats bc before you actually knew indians you could project qualities on them that you desired in a group you wanted to be a part of now that youve you known some indians those projections are shattered and youre disappointed with the reality
1346	1	lun te baj im an american sikh and dont support this shit

1352	1	that is not what he said he thinks what he had someone else say was what was in his opinion one of the worst things you could saydeath to all jews that is why he had them say it because it was shockingly bad it was ironic woah are you saying i dont belong here because im white is this segregation are you racisti like to better myself by being informed on the sentiments of other people is you racist

1355	1	kerala is pretty clean bangalore wasnt as bad as mumbai which actually wasnt that bad last time i visited either september but usually its so frigging bad
1356	1	dont you think you are presumptuous if you think white kids are evil to parents because try told you to sneak outand using the word evilseriouslyand sneak out from where school or homeand what is wrong with sneaking out sometimes
1357	1	i loved denver best 6 years of my life i honestly cannot say anything bad about colorado at all it is almost perfect  except that there arent very many indians therenew york is straight up dystopian in comparison
1358	1	yes
1359	1	what is worst is when they start badly and loudly speaking your language to you because they assume you cant speak english so rude and obnoxious
1360	1	my parents might know what that is but wagh bakri was my first contact with tea as a child and it is what ive drank ever since xd
1361	1	thank you brother i stand corrected and humiliated
1362	1	it isnt just the 2 nation thing though i suspect the policy views of average muslim hindu christian and sikh desis are very different from each other and would prevent meaningful solidarity
1363	1	ive noticed that too i see a lot of nondesi too whenever i suggest we go out to dinner my friends always want indian food in my area a lot of the indian cuisine are halal so i see muslims of different ethnicities there it could just be just a michigan thing
1364	1	i live in an area with a lot of desi muslims i see a lot of desi at indian restaurants because they serve halal food while local asian restaurants do not also i havent seen many indian takeout places as opposed to chinese takeout takeout food is more popular than sit down among the younger generation
1365	1	tattipost eh what is it in other languages and which language is that just went on context
1366	1	y u p
1367	1	the third world had their heads up their ass
1368	1	i love the way you described it wokeness as a performative art im going to use that phrase if you dont mind youre right they are the alphas usually individuals who are willing to talk about the grey areas usually are more verbose turns out that there usually is a nugget of truth on either side that needs to be considered and appropriately discussed unfortunately none of that fits in a marketable soundbite
1369	1	holy shit i used to be one of those people then i lost a ton of weight and gained a ton of muscle yay being unemployed goddamn its a different world out there
1370	1	well it is a good thing i lift then d
1371	1	i have to disagree with your first paragraph yes its not a deal beaker or anything but it certainly can influence young childrens view of their parents and their own self confidence and self identity until they get older i raised my mixed cousins and watched each one of them going through a variation of questioning their self identity andor rejecting their culture because of their indian fathers refusing to participate in certain cultural activities thats a broad statement but certain forms of lack of participation can be defining for a young child who lacks certain kinds of emotional iq and understanding give their age utoofemmetofunction alluded to this in their comment
1372	1	did they really have that rule lmao thats so silly but youre probably right its a pretty small user base so they probably do go through them
1373	1	some of my best friends are gujarati hindus that ive known for 5 plus years theyve never displayed the tribalistic attitudes this sub engages in on a weekly basis people here are just way too egoistic
1374	1	this guy comes out of his cave everytime these types of articles come out anything that degrees with his myopic world view is wrong then he attacks and cusses out every one honestly o would report him but i know that the people who are supposed to do anything pretty much agree with him
1375	1	they conquered india fair and squareanytjing they took they took because they won sucks they did but there should be zero reparations
1376	1	yeah idprefer to let my offspring and their generation shift through our bullshit
1377	1	gti think either op should speak to him privately and rip him apart for his sexist and racist behaviours and make it clear that his attitudes are disgusting from a western or indian perspectivewhich is the exact same thing i said in fewer words
1378	1	i mean probably but that is not the current situation i appreciate the call for nuance  which op really lacks
1379	1	everyone has their timeline
1380	1	me neither small world
1381	1	oh yeah the safri boyz good memories the daytimers were great but things really took off when b21 played at huge warehouse gigs at bagley is where youd have up to 3000 people a night bhangra in one arena drum n bass in another arena rnb in a third one those were huge they really brought the money into bhangra
1382	1	well it is in this picture wait till the load shedding hits lol
1383	1	true lol
1384	1	yes that is fine but i was discriminated on the basis of my caste haha but the caste system in and of itself is a joke in 21st century we should do away with caste system imo
1385	1	a lot of times indian immigrants regress a little or are frozen in time and become much more conservative here versus what they probably wouldve been like in india my parents joined vhp and they arent even religious people just want a connection to india really badly and it shows itself in regressive tendencies many times
1386	1	what about sunny
1387	1	i dont think this thread has anything to do with seeking white approval for who we are i wrote a paper for law school on racial classification of desis through american legal history after the passage of the 13th15th amendments but before 1950s laws on citizenship american citizenship was available to only whites blacks and native americans it is interesting to me that every time desis tried to get citizenship in those early days they only argued that they were white never black  even though if they had managed to legally qualify as black they would have gotten citizenship albeit with all the segregation issues that came hand in hand with being black
1388	1	gt ex allahabadthis is a poor example as allahabad is new name  prayag  is its original name from before akbar changed it in 1580

1390	1	yeah duh what is your point trump is only possible because of low iq white racists
1391	1	europeans had a few hundred year period were they excelled raping and pillaging other peoples of their resources that is nothing to be proud about it is actually a fatal flaw that whites historically were so imperialistic and violent there is something wrong with their underlying culture and religion that causes this
1392	1	bandra mumbai isnt all of india im from kolkata and while christmas is huge here literally no one celebrates halloween tbf christmas is more about chilling out with family and going to picnics here even in the suburbs

1397	1	uh im not whitewashed
1398	1	wrong they definitely care and they will be extremely butthurt about this
1399	1	yes i noticed that read the article you posted it was alarming also alarming we are not allowed to talk about it here in the west i guess if censorship enforced by hindu nationalists is good enough for the ceo of twitter
1400	1	waitwhat did the marines do
1401	1	youre the big dumb
1402	1	pewdiepie may or may not be deliberately racist but saying that he doesnt care about numbers is simply not true his view count and subscriber count started increasing ever since he started making videos about how his channel is going to be surpassed he may not care about being number one but he does want to milk it as much as possible before making his diss track there was a video where he condoned his fans spamming the t series comments section and disliking their videos for his own greed but he wasnt satisfied with that so he had to release the t series diss track where he dissed indians probably because he didnt know what to diss t series for because he was too lazy to research which is shown in other videos of his too or probably because t series wasnt responding and instead focussed on getting the attention of indians either way he gained a lot of subscribers and views since then for reference his daily view count and subscriber gain were 56 million and 2030k respectively before the drama and now it is 1112 million and 130140k respectivelyyou talk about individual vs corporation but where were these people when the top channels were mostly corporations before pewdiepie youtube itself is a corporation and it was meant to be a platform for video sharing and not for employing youtubers employing monetizing their videos started happening only when corporations started sponsoring their videos so they are essentially earning their income because of the same corporations yet they have the audacity to say that youtube was created and is meant for individual creators
1403	1	most desi answer ever hahahahaha
1404	1	was the lady an indofijian by any chance as in a descendant of indian coolies in fiji

1407	1	that movie made me try white castle
1408	1	gtchristianity is a jewish religionwellwe certainly wouldnt say so
1409	1	thanks for the words man i of course agree with you it is just hard to escape those thoughts sometimes i cant speak to your personal experience but i myself have like daily panic attacks about what is gonna happen not so much for me  i live on my own and have had more time to think about this my parents are wonderful and generous in heart but they live in a tight community thatll relentlessly give them shit for this which is painful to me i guess you just have to remind yourself to have courage it might be easy right now to just marry a woman but certainly more disastrous in the long term
1410	1	i sense cultural differences here in the united states sadly many older parents are shipped off to be forgotten about in their later years sucks it is not the way things should be im saving as much money as i can during my working years so that i can pay for my golden years even if my kids will be caring for me physically
1411	1	not everyone has a stem brain or aptitude for stem subjects or theyre simply more talented at artistic subjects  i would have floundered in a stem career  dont get me wrong stem careers are vital but saying people can pick artsy careers as a hobby is a bit dismissive  artistic subjects have their merits too  if everyone picked a stem career for income and stability we wouldnt have novels comic books movies plays actors sports teams singers etc
1412	1	he is the living personification of a state issued pakistani studies textbook
1413	1	gt so all desi people eat halal nope i dont strictly stick to halal either also there are tons and tons of options to for non meat eaters hence my comment regarding if halal meat is a must in every meal than you can bitch about missing out but in all honesty from fast food to fine dining there are plenty of options people have on the veg and seafood menu which is why i say youre a whiny sucka gt  act like half of the reactionary folks on this subreddit and start accusing other people of white worship if you do it own it lol gt sorry buddy but not all desi people are the same never claimed they were gt the sooner you learn not to throw stereotypes and labels at people the sooner youll be more educatedi base my opinion on your posting history and views on other topics as well gt you can say whatever you want to me it doesnt change the fact that youre insecure and bigotedtranslation moneymammoth is 5 and this is his way of saying no u lol
1414	1	i bet hindus in pakistan probably celebrate eid similarly
1415	1	ya op is kind of ignorant when it comes to addiction
1416	1	just skimmed through the article on that barfi culture what exactly is the issue here the report seems to say that there was an an orchestrated attempt to shine a spotlight on mr atwals invitation in order to embarrass the canadian government what is wrong with that indian govt didnt decieve canadian govt into inviting him they just highlighted it if the canadians dont like being in the spotlight for inviting convicted terrorists perhaps they shouldnt invite them
1417	1	same here i got more of a sense of community from white and black ppl than desis
1418	1	did you just assume their skin colorseriously i can somewhat understand it because gora has a bit of a racist and negative connotation
1419	1	id second this you either feel it out you dont sometimes it is not a conscious choice

1429	1	do you apply this idiotic philosophy to everything in life life isnt completely equal thats just how it is swallow your pride or youll be swallowing something a lot worse soon enough if you cant be mature and understanding enough to get this you have some fundamental personality flaws to take care of
1430	1	dick cheese isnt an issue if you bathe like once a day at leastsource  uncut dude bathe twice a day no dick cheese
1431	1	i think a lot of enlightened centrists thinkers like haidt unwittingly skew to the right of the political spectrum  the political right in america is literally engaging in a culture war with ethnic minorities academia and lgbtqia folk claiming that theyre silencing free speech  do people deserve a platform to voice their opinions sure we have the internet for that  but do academic institutions with their ability to legitimize ideas have that ethical obligation to give everyone a platform  i say no
1432	1	wrong sub many are blinded and cant see the fact that she fooled nick jonas a guy who is half her age if it was a man doing this everyone would judge him for it but somehow it is ok because pc is doing this any indian citizen who had struggles with us visa can tell that this is a green card marriage through to through
1433	1	dude why so rude youre asking this sub you know that means youre asking in your words people tapping keys in some american suburb why would you be hostile to the people youre asking for help
1434	1	well he lost
1435	1	south indian states already have issues related to river water sharingif they split into a different country choosing a capital city and building infrastructure will be even bigger issuethey need new armed forces new constitution and entire political structure has to be adjusted
1436	1	deplatforming works in the short term in the long term it is very ineffective as it unites certain people which create other alternative platforms and produces an environment where extremes find themselves among like minded people which reinforces and normalizes other extremefringe ideologies these people dont suddenly vanish they seek others that share the same sentiment and in many cases gravitate towards even more extreme ideologies than their original beliefs what is happening right now does not bode well for what is to come as these very people are going to come together and preach even more fringeextreme ideas edit to those that are doubting this it is already happened trump antivaxxers libertarians austrian economics and 911 truthers all have one thing in common the teaparty movement that happened 10 years ago those that were a part of that kind of movement felt sidelined betrayed and unheard that is to say they felt that they were being ignored and so you have a silicon valley vc like peter thiel and alex gay frogs jones suddenly be bed fellows in 2018
1437	1	tbh daal or even strong onion or garlic breath dont bother me in the least but having breath like they havent brushed them since morning i hope it wasnt longer absolutely kills the mood for me
1438	1	not sure if sarcastic
1439	1	i agree with you 100  indian government spends way too much money on political populist crap that it should spend on real issues insteadampx200bbut when you say it like that it is constructive criticism when someone says im going to overlook everything that is positive and fixate on the statue  he is a hater this was the point of original link and we see this type of hate all the time in various forms like bobs and vagene memes space club cow cartoons mars missions is fine but where are the toilets etc
1440	1	i find mediocre comedians crying and being little bitches about them bombing at a show and the handful of likeminded fans who also bitch about pc college snowflakes when they cannot fathom that not everyone thinks like them pretty funnypretty much this article and the comments herealso chappelle and mulaney
1441	1	lol my parents constantly called me out for saying stupid shit to the point at which i pretty much dont talk to anybody irl in fear of accidentally saying stupid shit

1443	1	robot 20rajnikanth will never fail you
1444	1	are they a news station because that would be pretty fucked sort of like your local news station showing a picture of chef from south park when the president of nigeria visits your city
1445	1	i thought the same thing lmao
1446	1	dont watch her snapchat if you care for her
1447	1	and it continues amongst sikhs which was literally founded to transcend caste differences there is something bonkers about our culture which values difference and hierarchy
1448	1	it is non existent in almost all desi diaspora and in india too regarding exact stats on ratio i have no idea and ive never seen any census count them so
1449	1	i am not sure of the original source but a quick google search seems to indeed suggest that the writing is from a museum called _dakshina chitra_ in tamil nadu india ive never been there but it looks like the museum houses historical artifacts insofar as they pertain to tamil language art and culture

1452	1	do you even read indian americans vote at way higher rates than 23 and the vast majority vote democrat i cant talk to someone this dumb go read before you post you are embarrassing yourself
1453	1	i realise there is name calling but my point is that it is not impossible to enforce a culture of good but necessary debate and by the way the site used to have far more users than this sub has my aim isnt to denigrate this place  just to say that discussions on these topics is important and necessary and shouldnt be shut down
1454	1	i think you have a point though i am pretty sure you will find a higher frequency of dysfunctional families in the desi community and maybe even middle easterners than white families

1457	1	unlike the american counter parts the children of mirpuris  are do have a life within their own community so some see no need to integrate as everything they need financially and spiritually can be accessed by remaining with in the community i actually dont have a problem with people who dont integrate my only expectation from any other citizen in united states is that they follow the laws and pay their taxes whether they want to be an open community or closed off is irrelevant imoi always found native westerners thumping integration as a bit of a hypocritical position on one hand individuality is paramount in western culture on the other minorities are being attacked not because they dont care for individualism but because they arent integrating lol western nations should plan for integration when they give citizenships to people if that is infact a goal allowing communities like edison jacksonheights china town are actually bad if you want the minorities to fully integrate
1458	1	definitely this the late 1800 is was also a lot like the 60 is in that  spiritualism and transcendentalism became quite in vogue spurring study of indian religious and cultural tradition see chicago world fair and swami vivekananda
1459	1	gtbecause you are literally on meta canada reddit bro it is like the canadian equivalent of the donald subreddit  it is hard to take anyone serious from those subs when all they do is spew their vitrioland i post on a bunch of other subreddits as well that is like me saying that it is difficult to take you seriously when you post on your university subreddit it is kind of a stupid insult that serves no purpose gti beg to differ there is a reason pakistan is still the most poorly understood super power in the worldthat ignorant pakistani nationalism shows up again and you tell me i am projecting gt there are so many factors at work at the nation that not even the local know what exactly is going onwhat does this even mean gtthere is literally a separatist movement going on in balochistan because of how different their culture is from the dominant punjabi cultureyeah it is not like the pakistani state have a habit of dickign around in balochistan and not taking care of their demands or killing balochis who advocate for more self government to be honest you actually seem rather ignorant of south asia and pakistan especially i suggest stick with studying biology so should i really take any of your opinions seriously when you dont know basic things about south asia and you are rather ignorantly nationalistic
1460	1	the current leaders of democrats are not really progressive but the new generation is progressive i guess even with continental standards
1461	1	work hours are not the restrictions he was talking about
1462	1	gteconomic downfall or did i misread your tone    misread i dont mean economic downfall but the demographic change in population that will represent 50 white 50 nonwhite in the future nothing to do with economics just demographics    i believe its the birthright of africans and asians to move to uk and live there

1465	1	op said what he said youre not really contributing much to the discussion like sharing your own story or suggesting books for us to read or generally commenting intelligently on an aspect of the post you find interesting youre just trying to confirm the biases your parents handed down to you just because your parents have a lax edit conservative definition of what an alcoholic is doesnt mean everyone else does
1466	1	the couples who have such close marriages dont see anything at all wrong with it so they wouldnt think of doing things like genetic testing or not having children

1470	1	this is true and it is a common counterargument to a lot of the imperialism is evil arguments the fact is however that british hegemony was far more damaging to india than muslim hegemony was white supremacy and the outright exploitation of the third world have completely shaped the modern world in a way that the mongols and muslims never really did
1471	1	gtwhy would i look at state level laws we are talking about america as a wholeampx200bgtwe are talking about the democratic party  and how progressive they are to other parties in canada and western  europe not the end goal and what a country implements meaning not how  progressive the country actually isthese virtually contradict each other the statelevel laws were largely created and passed by democrats with a capital d who were on the ballot with the d next to their name if were focusing on people in the party as opposed to the end goal then it makes complete sense to talk about state laws when they define social issues that are currently significantalso no one ever specified were talking about america as a whole which provides a very incomplete picture in a relatively decentralized republic like the us last i checked according to you we were talking about american democrats which is understood to be democrats who are american usgtwhich one according to this httpsenwikipediaorgwikiuniversal_suffragehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiuniversal_suffragei was actually referring to switzerland but i suppose other examples would work

1479	1	my brother is the same way my dad did the same thing and he regrets it at this point because he aged out of all the programs that could have helped him and now it is an uphill battle to sort his issuesi am just trying to make sure no other family has to deal with it desis are just so focused on curing them that they ignore their development and looking for easy quick fixes honestly they are probably the most difficult to deal with along with east asian families because they have the same mentality my friend who got me this job after i failed out keeps telling me how much  the fact that i can actually be there to understand and then challenge the desis has helped so muchit is one of the reasons i think all this talk about affirmative action and high achieving model minority talking points that is shared on this sub is bullshit the way that some of them treat children with special needs and hold them back or suppress them as shameful objects is appalling they cant even look after their most vilnerable without contempt and then expect others to empathize with their petty issues sorry for the rant lol
1480	1	i saw it happen all the time in college and watched my brother go through it my brother has done all his schooling since college at ivy leagues and now is finishing training in plastic surgery among indian families hes highly desirable for their daughters he was on shaadicom a while back and a girls mother  called my mom and asked if he might be interested in one of their two daughters specifically that particular daughter was closer in age to my brother and was a pa so both families thought it was a good match the other daughter was significantly younger and an engineer they went on a few dates during which one the sister came along my brother said it was embarrassing how much the younger sister flirted with him instead of support her older sister at the end of the date my brother felt really awkward and apparently it was clear that the older sister was mortified a few days later the mother of the girls called and said that she was not interested anymore but didnt give much explanation my brother reached out to the girl and asked what happened apparently ww3 erupted in their house after the date because the younger sister thought her parents hadnt found a guy like that for her she was barely 24 and her parents wanted to give her more time and werent looking for her yet so it had caused such a rift among the sisters that the mother called things off my brother didnt even really get to know her yet but he also didnt want drama my brother is not some hot stud or anything but he has all the right pedigree  and a good attitude which i think makes any guy attractive i have seen this issue happen before from other high achieving men desi or otherwise

1487	1	from a historical standpoint christianity judaism islam and buddhism meet those requirements
1488	1	lmao at ancaps and libertarians pitching capitalism to me like twobit used car salesmen my point has nothing to do with capitalism but rather exactly what you just said about your parents the legal us immigration system is built to admit educated individuals from certain countries which is why the desi community is a high earning demographic here
1489	1	hey that is what you get for stuffing jade eggs into your vag
1490	1	computer person here and i hate yelp in general poor uiux  slow
1491	1	stats whitewashing internalized racism etc say otherwise dad bod and fuckboycurly hair sounds like a guy straight out of rindianpeoplefacebook  cant even mention the fact that im indian without getting child gangrape jokes
1492	1	haha i grew up here in the states well after daytimers were a thing i only know about them and this type of music through youtube plus daytimers were recently highlighted in the  pump up the bhangra documentary produced by the bbc in august i know recently they had a throwback daytimer in the midlands i joined a fb group of old uk punjabi uncles talking about this type of musici believe the chan mere makhna you are talking about is by the safri boyz totally right about the desi diaspora hell even bollywood used some of these songs in their movies
1493	1	im talking comics wise the movies are hit and miss
1494	1	it doesnt matter it translates over because people become racist mostly through what they read on the news or see on tv i never said racism against black or native people didnt exist but the racism against indians are at least just as bad and in many cases worse we have quotations against us while they recieve affirmative action socially we are far more hated due to public image after how we where portrayed by the media for decades
1495	1	i see this seems like an issue that can really only be solved through more exposure to desis whether irl or on tvgta isnt georgia right
1496	1	i see tons of indian women who look like her
1497	1	its fucking bullshit yeawhat if you dont come into contact with the girl often though and want to ask her out what if its a girl from a couple years ago you havent seen in a while and you want to just hang out and then decide if you want to go for herwhy does it get assumed as creepy and automatic interest followed by a ghosting
1498	1	nobody truly accept others for what they are if not why would we even choose our partners anyway
1499	1	that is something very similar i have been through too not getting the name pronounced in a decent way i am lucky that my last name is easy and until now i introduce myself always with my last nameand my family was the first immigrant family to live where i live and as i said only me and my brother were the only indians at schoolnow also in university i havent seen any indians in my class there are only 4 visible  foreigners one is me and the other three are chinese exchange studentsthank you sharing really appreciated
1500	1	gtno offense to anyone but ive noticed muslims girls just arent as promiscuous as their non muslim south asian counterparts lmao at believing this
1501	1	she is japanese not white
1502	1	hahaha i know right i feel like a grandma on there at the ripe old age of 26 the posts are hilarious though lol
1503	1	if you are not getting good service instead of speaking out here dont tip and do it
1504	1	exactly we are in agreement but shouldnt you quote the person i was talking to and not me
1505	1	im not into that story either though
1506	1	my parents are also kolkata bengalis and i also learned to play the piano as a kid the competitiveness drove me to hate it but i fell in love with it again playing hindi showtunes until grad school killed everything i used to enjoyim also a stem major i went to graduate school for chemicalmolecular biology and i work as a data scientist currently i agree with almost all the things op listed and i have a feeling that more than half of the abcds i know actually feel the same way we just keep our mouth shut because there is no point in picking fights with both sides of the political spectrumto op dont judge stem folks by their academic choices it has little bearing on what kind of people we are
1507	1	islam and islamized culture are beautiful and i can respect it either in the birthplace of islam or outside of it as in south asia however south asian culture art and history is very distinct and it is that cultural trend i really admire if i wanted to get really into islamic architecture or history or whatever there are plenty of great places to do this south asia included but if i really want to get into indic architecture history etc only south and southeast asia can truly offer this i ignore the islamic stuff not because i hate it or discriminate but because it is a foreign patina under which lies a rich and unique heritage that heritage is the one im particularly intrigued by so its the one i will pay attention to hope my point comes across
1508	1	how can you even saw white people today arent hateful yes not all of them are hateful but jfc look at the rise of trump lots of them probably around 50 of white americans are very hateful and racist
1509	1	what proof have you given me this is also a sub focused on indian americans so it is more appropriate to talk about indian americans than any other race  the solution would be for indian americans to stop fetishizing indian culture  i think that is a fairly straightforward solution  do you have any issues with iti dont think ive derailed our conversation  im responding to what youre saying and brushing off the unnecessary insults
1510	1	why are you focusing on the word evil i used it to mean really bad should i not use it
1511	1	yea man i def dont want an arranged marriage
1512	1	i def caught a few episodes especially as i wrote my pilot my script aims to be somewhere between clerks and masters of none
1513	1	arabs are mostly white with a white religion islam but what you said isnt even that true arabs at most colonized spain and portugal but not the rest of europe and they didnt annihilate the local populations and arabs may discriminate against south asians in the mideast but they did not steal the land from them and the african slave trade to the mideast was not that great in distance or scope as what happened in the western hemp
1514	1	bc i am up jaat never heard people not liking sikhs hell most think they cool like there is no sense of anti sikh sentiment the more common image is industrious people who love to drink and eat
1515	1	then you need glasses
1516	1	2 would mean that there are more gay people than there are christians in india
1517	1	thank you
1518	1	many women prefer older men and i would say even 10 years older is okey in many cases for them judging by what i have seen also having the first child by 35 if you are a woman is not really a good idea many of the eggs will not be functional by that point and the risk of having unhealthy children increases its possible but if you want at least 2 kids you should start earlier
1519	1	the irony of devon is it is more like little pakistan than little india lol
1520	1	yeah you cant get it by the slice though just a full pizzai recommend getting it with a thin crust and definitely get the white flour not whole wheat
1521	1	different strokes for different folks is my response to that but on a serious level everyone has a different learning style while i still appreciate having spoken in hinglish at home throughout childhood and into today there are colloquial words phrases and inflections that i learned and continue to learn solely from watching bollywood movies my parents still stop laugh and wonder sometimes when i use a word that they definitely dont use in everyday conversation  not only is it fun for me to know those words it also opens up more dialogue and discussion between us about the language so while bollywood movies might not be the right learning medium for you it may be for someone else
1522	1	theyre the ones that will suffer consequences if they dont
1523	1	im not saying that at all its totally possible he just feels underconfident or that its not as straightforward im just saying that to a child a lot of implicit communication or things that look like disinterest can very easily come off as dad looks down on me
1524	1	bahut uche jaoge beta
1525	1	that is such a great point ill share this with him thank you maybe he could learn with my son
1526	1	why
1527	1	and if possible tip them in cash i have heard that several restaurant owners pocket all the tips when they employ desis on f1 illegally
1528	1	that is not even comparing apples to oranges it is more like comparing apples to a cactus
1529	1	im not downplaying anything it us other people who are downplaying thebhard work others do all i am sayung is to not blame others if what you wanted was not given to you espwcially when there are so many opportunuties in this country that you will never get anywhere else
1530	1	thats just the government passing the buck and saving face by throwing minorities ubder the bus of course most stupid desis here will accept that
1531	1	i went out with a girl who was proud of being an abcd and even called herself a coconut she said to any more dates because i have indian accent there are every kind of people in the world
1532	1	yeah im the same way also ill never be able to roll an r so malayalam is inaccessible to me
1533	1	this is kinda what my family does i dont eat much meat in the first place i dont cook meat at home mainly because i dont want to outside the house i do eat meat and if its a dish that is traditionally made with beef ill eat that to try it i dont have much of a taste for beef though my family doesnt like pork because they didnt grow up eating it  i have never heard any reason for hindus specifically not to eat pork and its actually one of my favorite types of meat
1534	1	just wanted to clarify  you mean you especially distrust the lgbtq and feminist communities more so than the larger community at largeif so why is that
1535	1	there are two eid festivals as well tho
1536	1	you really cant compare spanish to indian languages spanish is deeply deeply rooted in major parts of the us hell even in the miami airport i only hear spanish on the intercoms and from tsa
1537	1	agreed
1538	1	i hope so and i hope the younger generation of desis settling in the us from india also dont bring over that toxiccontrolling aspect of desi parenting that weve come to experience
1539	1	my mom grew up in the late 60s and 70s in england and would say it was wild racist
1540	1	this is why i dont go to desi auntyuncle parties
1541	1	he doesnt practice and isnt a muslim so why would he make her convertyou dont know much
1542	1	let him meet up with neil nitin mukesh and maybe they can trade some names around
1543	1	comparing us liberals to euro liberals is a meaningless exercise
1544	1	gt how could a country that not 30 years ago saw a violent genocide not have a residual ethnic tension sitting latentwell for one thing it was a pogrom not a genocide  sikhs were the majority in the punjab then just as they are now unlike in a genocide when an entire group is removed from an areasecondly it wasnt divided on religious lines  a large percentage of people involved on the side of the congress led government and even the military were sikh themselves  heck even the congress apointed president of india at the time gyani zail singh was sikh himself
1545	1	calzones or bustbitch
1546	1	not more indian just less strongly american
1547	1	gt my ex fatherinlaw was an atheist hitler loving russia lived communistim sorry but that makes no sense did you mean to write russia loving in any case why would a communist who has lived in or loves russia ever love hitleralso your account seems insincere when you have a history of posting stuff such as thesei hears stories of torture of indian prisoners when our batsmen hit pak bowlers for a boundaryhttpsnpredditcomrindiaspeakscommentsa6ndxvvijaydiwas_commemorated_every_16_dec_in_indiaebwkxa9andthis nonsensical imagehttpsnpredditcomrindiacomments5518xbcareers_in_pakistan_vs_india
1548	1	agreed
1549	1	my indian wife went through much of the same when she tried to get her family is blessings i and her have been confronted and threatened thankfully things never got physical part of her family has cut off contact with those from her family who werent as opposed to the marriage  her acceptance and integration into my family was practically seemless the only caveat my parents had for a partner was she has to be muslim didnt matter what caste class nation or race she belonged to as long as she was muslim my parents were cool with it it gave me a much bigger pool of potential partners to work with when my wife is father passed away in india i couldnt accompany her and be with my wife to support her because her family back in india did not want me there i refrain from getting into the kind of threats and drama that was created over me wanting to be there to support my wife to this day some of her family members believe that she is a victim of this weird made up thing called love jihad
1550	1	after my csection they gave me a cup with 2 percocets and a oxycontin to swallow at once hardcore partyin europe the pain is managed entirely with tylenol and motrin so my inlaws were wtf they are getting you high as it turns out we have shorter hospital stays than in europe with poorly organized care and they basically get us doped up so that they can kick us out in the insuranceapproved 4 days wed need less hardcore painkillers if there was the potential of a longer recovery in the hospital andor some nursing help at homealso i took opioids for the minimum time  48 hours  and then managed the remaining 2 days with motrins but at the end of my hospital stay they offered me 30 oxycodone pills even though id been fine without them i refused it on principle
1551	1	huh whos calling for that they just call for an end to illegal immigration how would you feel if you had to grow up in a village in india beat out a million others in studies and get a chance to come in the us and work your ass off sacrificing everything while some mexican can cross the border and can stay here and reap the same benefits that youve had legally wait for many indians are like that illegal immigration needs to end
1552	1	not a first date just ask her out for coffee
1553	1	thanks for proving my point kiddo lol
1554	1	op is in med school lol i really doubt shes actually gonna join the military
1555	1	wow ditto
1556	1	right but you can find instances of muslims doing the same muslims coexisted relatively peacefully with jews in palestine precrusades as well as in spain under the moors prior to the inquisition i dont know anything about jewishhindu relations but i know the relationship between christians and hindus isnt 100 peaceful either christianity doesnt have a peaceful history off the top of my head there is the baltic crusade albigensian crusade torture and forced conversions of indigenous americans literally wiping 2 or 3 continents religious history out crusades against muslims and the continual persecution of jews which has died down only in the last century or soi never said islam in its current state is as tolerant as christianity or judaism it is been damaged by fundamentalism but i dont think it is more or less intolerant than other religions if you take a wider historical view of it like countries religions develop at different rates there was a point during medieval history where you could switch islam was the religion that looked more peaceful relative to christianity anyway who knows if mainstream islam will become more moderate i doubt itll happen in my lifetime but i really hope it willive seen the onion picture before and think it is funny the rogan snippet is dumb because islam is huge compared to mormonism if you take a group of billion people youre bound to end up with some psychos especially if mamy of them are concentrated in third world hellholes with weak rule of law compared to mormons who are all raised in the usa i appreciate rogan is interviews with fighters but the dudes pretty bottom of the barrel when it comes to being a comedian or an intellectual
1557	1	you know were both caucasian right if you paint some indians white they look european if you paint some europeans brown they look arabindian
1558	1	seconding i used to destroy my hair ties and accidentally drench them in oil when i oiled my hair and bought a pack from f21 to try out and holy heck it was worth it so i went and bought a pack from sephora and theyve been fantastic when they stretch out just put them in hot water for a bit and it should go back to normal size
1559	1	ah okay thanks for the clarification
1560	1	that is really unrealistic amount for the average consumer setting the bar that high will only make others seem cheap standard is and should be 1520ampx200bif service industry workers expected to be tipped 100150 of the bill than they need to be looked at
1561	1	yeah he is a cunt but you shouldnt make fun of his disabilityif a blind guy is racist towards south asians you shouldnt make fun of his blindness in retribution you should call him out for being a cunt two wrongs dont make a right
1562	1	thats like 15th century level of casteism i dont think any brahmin these days even in india would be casteist enough to refuse to touch a nonbrahmin
1563	1	why is modi pm then
1564	1	wouldve been veena in my case my family is southern
1565	1	its free to check so i guess ill do it
1566	1	well we did just put a rapist on the supreme court
1567	1	yeah lol how does he not understand context we dont know this girl
1568	1	how is she opportunist
1569	1	i dont see any organized effort to improve education from the ground up in response to the changing skill level needed for today is jobs  tbh i dont think our educational system has ever been made for that
1570	1	gti think the answer depends on who you ask but i dont see the connection between military and the hindu minority being forced to leavethe connection would be that conflicts had to start somewhere eh human beings dont start killing each other there is always an instigator hence the question  which came first and is that relevant to this conversation
1571	1	similar age similar story lmao
1572	1	im not okay with sexual assault but then im not okay with tax evaders either let is kill them all too while were at it i hate how smokers give others second hand smoke it is like giving someone cancer anyone who smokes in a non smoking area theyll have to die also
1573	1	gt but those establishments also say that tipping is not necessaryall of state of california and washington have mandatory wages for the food workers san francisco is just special and adds the healthcare tax and on top of that their bills also have separate sections on the bill for server tips and tips for kitchen hence my disdain for sit down restaurants in sf and preference for fast casual
1574	1	um what im not trying to prove a point or anything i dont particularly like the taste but ill eat it if someone offers me and why would i want to tell my parents ive eaten beef just to start a fight
1575	1	unsaturated fats are good for youred wine does contain antioxidants that help with cholesterolyou really are dumb
1576	1	guess i ran out of luck
1577	1	just put out the red xmas ornaments for diwali then add the green right before xmas
1578	1	lmao hate makes people stupid shitheads and you are the perfect example
1579	1	not denying that if various kingdoms in south asia were united along some commonality like christianity united western europe to a certain extent   then the indian subcontinent wouldve looked a lot different today the brits didnt invade india with superior weapons or a large army they started with mercantilism and then by pitting one indian kingdom against the other but that still doesnt excuse the brits and colonial apologist from claiming it was good for us and we should be grateful that is like raping someone and claiming since they werent getting any it was good for them or if they didnt want to be raped they shouldve carried a gun
1580	1	why do you list high immigration as a top reason for economic downfall or did i misread your tone your link shows 51 asian population in uk which is lower than 56 in us it hasnt hurt the us very much do you think the uk attracts a lower quality of immigrantsheres my take uk 2017 gdp was 2622t indias was 2597t chinas is already higher by 6x without being a nationalistic blowhard its easy to see that developing economiesformer colonies will surpass uk by growth rates alone qol will still be much higher in uk due to per capita wealth and existing infrastructure but the early economic advantage they gained in this game of civilization by looting rest of the world is quickly fading away
1581	1	i hate coconuts more than i hate kkk members but there are both male and female coconuts for example all this pewdiepie shit with indians in the comments saying im indian and i agree with this makes me fucking mad like have some self respect
1582	1	what are you talking about mariah smith wrote an article for a website the website first edited the article after published it to tone it down it was still pretty offensive to the point where the website took the article down completely this isnt a random twitter war and isnt about what she posted on twitter it is about an article she wrote
1583	1	dont know why you were downvoted jeez people they are just opinions
1584	1	people like you take the narrative away from other groups as well there is the hypocrisy i say that the history of the subcontinent is a diversity and mixture of cultures and religions no one religion owns the history however most right wing hindus will always make the narrative that islam doesnt belong in the subcontinent history and many are actively taking measure to erase it from the country those who advocate oit are doing the exact same thing as the british did before them whether they want to admit it or notthe oldest segments of dna came from africa anthroplogically and genetically the out of africa theory is the one most widely accepted out of people who understand and have studied it there is no actual evidence of it looping around the subcontinent and central asiaas for your britons comment there is quite a lot of narratives within the areas where these groups originated there are still strong pockets of these histories within the communities the celtic cultures scots and irish have a lot to say about the britons and it has manifested over history in multiple ways such as the scots independence movements and the troubles however not everything is disseminated across the world think of how bollywood is basically synonymous india culture to outsiders even though it only represent a small fraction of the indian subcontinent
1585	1	entirely muslim in fact what with the quraysh tribe in the islamic origin story and all that
1586	1	if your parents are like mine they constantly stress over it and wonder whats going to happen to their country they probably wont affect you directly but they could indirectly via family drama
1587	1	httpsenwikipediaorgwikigolkonda
1588	1	i feel like i was kind of like you when i was 18 in that i didnt feel particularly restricted at the time i didnt really engage in any rebellious activities and i guess my family wasnt that strict relative to some brown parentsbut when i went away to college i found that things started getting more stressful i suddenly was presented with much more social opportunities ie barsclubs parties vacations with friends late night hangouts etc that i didnt have before and i found myself much more eager to engage in that stuff point being some of the things you mentioned must get straight as no late nights no sleepovers still do still seem like fairly restrictive demands for a college student i think if your parents dont pull back the reigns a little once you go away to college you may find that you end up clashing even though things are okay now which is basically what happened with me p
1589	1	your kind is welcome with a valid visa
1590	1	yeah the flight attack was the worst attack done by sikhs in its history and is a terroristextremist act proof that there has been sikh extremism in canada but that doesnt really show why the canadian gov is saying there is sikh extremism within canadian borders in 2018
1591	1	worse things have been said and received many more upvotes by brigaders sometimes mods havent even shut them down
1592	1	i think it could be what region from pakistan they are all the urdu speaking pakistani people are my bros the punjabis were in another circle all together
1593	1	exactly it is an incident where a guy bombed and is jow whining because people didnt find him funnyit isnt some huge free speechdeplatforming issue where a persons rights were violated
1594	1	is that why theres a decent christian population there
1595	1	no try again
1596	1	lolwat
1597	1	in this scenario you at least wanted to meet together another time if you feel so strongly to not meet someone and its making you tense up and walk away you shouldnt be forced to go meet a person who dont want to talk to a second time props to you if it worked to you but it is never worked for me all it is done is cause me to dislike the person 10x more
1598	1	there are few good people but very few most of them are self loathing pseudoliberal dumbasses who hate nrisabcds because they cant be them
1599	1	i did for like two months until i found out she was trying to use me to get a green card and had punctured holes in my condoms to try and seal the dealtoo bad she didnt know im on steroids and couldnt knock up a girl unless i come off
1600	1	deleted  08964  what is thishttpspastebincomfcrfs94k58719
1601	1	fact
1602	1	httpsyoutubeqw9psr8mypi
1603	1	gt wow a progressive desi list without gabbardit is because she isnt desi
1604	1	i didnt even see the article you are referring to but i do see this on the front page which has little to do w american desis and more to do w hindus and indianshttpsnpredditcomrabcdesiscommentsa3ze9ywhy_is_the_world_so_obsessed_with_indias_caste
1605	1	i feel like they were being sarcastic and you all just got whooshed lol or im getting whooshed now
1606	1	thanks for the recommendation
1607	1	agreed personally i hardly interact with abcds anymore i have little to no contact with my abcd relatives i dont do business with abcds including avoiding going to abcd doctors when the need does arise
1608	1	yeah and the point is that interfaith marriages work when both religions dont claim  exclusivity and respect each other they dont work when one of the religions denounces the other as pagan or evil
1609	1	welcome brother
1610	1	same
1611	1	didnt they mostly go to uk
1612	1	gt plant is feel pain toooh no lol that is one of the worst arguments it is cool how you try to educate your mom  has she changed her stance or habits gt defensiveyoure a brave one for going there i hope that at least a few of them can channel that discomfort into changegthow longit wasnt an abrupt change as it took me a month to give up mayonnaise i know p but ive been fully vegan since maybe july
1613	1	wow sorry to hear that really wish your parents would get a wakeup call what did it for me was a girl i met online that does art stuff and videogames when this internet stranger sent me a gift box in the mail for christmas my parents just stared at me in disbelief that a white girl treated me better than any of their potential prospects theyve tried to hook me up with dont know what would make them snap out of it i would say if my parents were still as anal as yours id probably be living a few thousand miles away from them broke and maybe with a minimum wage job yes but i would be free so to speakwell i cant say i know what to look for in 34 phone calls to say ill marry you parents have grown wise enough to leave it in my court they would make excuses and say things for the person just like yours but ill put my foot down and be i really dislike them like stick middle finger up at them in traffic sort of dislike first couple times i had to do this for them to get the message now theyll understand if i say no that is the end of itfor what i look forthe biggest thing is an equal partner in conversation ask or talk to me just as much as i talk back to you dont sit in utter silence talk about almost anything weather news something dont make me have to go every single question to askthe other is how knowledgeable about the world you are at this point im looking for a collegeeducated woman that knows somewhat how to take care of herself and knows some things about the world never watched star wars not a problem but would raise a suspicious eyebrow dont want asian or white friends and hate cooking for one is self not be a cook in the house never picked up a video game controller or own a computer yeah all the red flags in russia went uplastly if there is any sort of shady behavior i usually ditch and tell my parents im out this will be things like unusual pressures to call ie i sent you a hi im so and so text and youre telling me that you want to call because you hate texting in like the very next message lying about certain information that was told by the parents or having strange expectations this usually is my dealbreaker above the others if a complete stranger is being treated like this why the heck should i believe that someone close would treat me any betterlastly id say i want to see them in person before saying youre compatible enough i wouldnt just rely on a phone conversation before agreeing i would actually turn down a proposal if i wasnt allowed to see the person in person before anything went forward
1614	1	thank you really feel i am not the only one
1615	1	i get that its a good vibe when everyone is in sync when tripping
1616	1	i dont think they instigate death threats and brigade subs
1617	1	i thought imdb removed comments years ago  are you referring so something else
1618	1	wait a minute im pretty sure u sports is a part of ccaa canadian college atheltic association just like douglas royals which means that even though the teams are from different leagues they still play each other for the championship i could be wrong but isnt the ccaa the ncaa equivalent in canada and not usports
1619	1	south america  first ive heard of thatbut those latino soap operas are sort of similarly dramatic so i could see it
1620	1	so is trick or treating
1621	1	i found it weird too i mean she knew i am about to finish my residency and went to med school here  that usually gives it away because you have people on visa doing residency here but you rarely have a desi person come here on student visa for med schoolgt i really want to hear how a combo of an indian and midwestern accent would sound like lollol sounds fake af sometimes i just try to sound as indian as i can what i found even funnier was the fact that this girl was a smart girl who was a ivy league grad probably makes decent money and was your typical girl next door who is cute and hot at the same time lol and yet she thinks that guys care more about the greencard than her i am just a bit surprised she would go out with me if she thought i was in it for a green card or whatever lol
1622	1	i just tried it took the placement seemed ok
1623	1	im north indian and i hated it too not because of the south indian thing but because it was just a shit movie in general i dont think this is an unpopular opinion
1624	1	wow thought it was just me lol
1625	1	what exactly are the sikh religious laws theocracies in general tend to suck but what sikh laws would do other religions harm could you please give an example
1626	1	then they shall be our schools
1627	1	sure but every fanbase has an extreme and we cant group them altogether those people should be condemned op is reaction towards pdp isnt unwarranted however it is a bit prejudiced to say the least
1628	1	i moved here when i was 17 i call myself an immigrant since my parents didnt move with me you are technically an immigrant too but you may feel more like a 1st gen
1629	1	lulwhatever gets you through the day
1630	1	there are significant number of hindus in punjab and you would be surprised to know that there is a high percentage of christians as well which is underreportedcaste for affirmative action is valid only if your identify as sikh buddhist or hindu sikhs arent an absolute majority in indian punjab
1631	1	oh damn now that is a power combo if ive ever seen one
1632	1	it is like opposite of hinduism devas are the bad guys and ahuras are the good guys in hinduism it is devas are the good gods and asuras as the bad ones

1637	1	anarchocapitalism doesnt mean one company dominating a certain region or market access to a free market where rational consumers can choose to engage with multiple competitors is assumed to me it is more of a goal than a viable political system that can be implemented today
1638	1	author never mentions the word hindustan and particularly mentions that they used the term land of hindus and not hindustan which is an entirely different term and would make more sensethe term hindustan was never mentioned in the adventures of kathlyn speaking of which the term hindustan itself is a persian word meaning land of hind which was the arabpersian word for north india and was in reference to the indus river httpsenwikipediaorgwikihindustangt the fucking word for indian in russiansyrianlebonesemandarinjapanesethaicambodian and every civilised country on earth etc is hindustani cant speak for the other countries but they speak arabic in lebanon and syria and the word for india in that language is alhind and people from india are called hindi

1653	1	the fact that he was sacked because of his sexist and racist views may have an impact on his worldly view even if he doesnt change but instead keeps his views to himself will make him a better colleague to work with dont know why youre defending this kind of behaviour im sure if you was treated like that you would at the very least raise a complaint
1654	1	i really wish the indian states were their own coutries or at least split south india and north india into different countries i feel like that would solve a lot of issues and create some too probably
1655	1	except all that they stole stayed in india they built monuments that fill indian coffers to this day tourists from around the world flock to see historic sights built by these people ie qutb minar taj mahal etc and that money goes to the indian government and belongs to the publicwhatever the british stole now sits in the uk to the benefit of the british and not indians
1656	1	yeah it sucks i wouldnt want to ever raise my kids like that either but i honestly dont think anyone in my family even my cousins or siblings would have my back during a fallout and to be honest neither would my friends
1657	1	but do you acknowledge that the rhetoric is focused on the foreign workers rather than the corporation though your initial comment focused on the worker gt who are happy to work at lower rates so they can drive down wages for everyone the tone dismisses much of the responsibility on the employer
1658	1	i am not hung up on the free samplers that incident was the straw that broke the camel is back and it is my right to be a dick by not tipping if the waiter gives blatantly better treatment a mere few feet in front of me in my line of sight and sound if i can easily see that the server was not living up to their potential when serving me that just rubs me the wrong way i am an equal customer and therefore should receive equal treatment even if  it is not the exact same ie i can understand them being attentive towards people who may be unfamiliar with the dishes but at the same time they should also not completely ignore the people who are knowledgeable about the menu and ask them about their thoughts on the dishes as well

1669	1	paharis invented ants actually paharis invented everything
1670	1	it doesnt factor indias idea of poverty the world poverty clock uses data from the un world bank and imf comparing india to the us is futile the world bank adjusts raw data to compare costofliving differences yes 5 is a large number in 20092010 about 30 of indians lived in poverty if you ask me thats remarkable progress

1674	1	so then this is not what the problem is in america why would you even make such a comment
1675	1	i will take back what i said but i need a more larger scale study than just pakistani muslims in bradford that place is filled with these people  from mirpur  could be more of a mirpur problem than a british pakistani problem
1676	1	the first line is interesting why would you consider it racist i would think of it more of as a form of stereotyping than inherently racist
1677	1	the anticorruption and antibribery laws are not what makes it totalitarian though it is the suppression of speech that does obviously no one will say that hitler drank water so we should not drink water but i think it is fair to say hitler was racist so we should not be racist as the second thing is what makes him so badwho is we are those people not counted it we or is it only woke twitter that picks who can speak allowing a majority to decide what can and cannot be said is tyranny by majority and that is why we guarantee the freedom of speech even to morons like milo so that we do not oppress the minority of society had progressives not been allowed to speak by the racist majority we might still have segregation or even slavery as in the 1700s a majority of people though of blacks as inferior
1678	1	this phrase gtyou shouldnt talk about topics you dont knowcomes cross as angry old uncleaunty thing to say
1679	1	i think the way white families interact can be different but their bonds and relationships can be very very strong and there are lots of traditions such as going to great unce bobs farm or whatever i think everyone has those relatives they dont like or who are nosy or who are racist though

1683	1	thanks that was a great read and very informative youre right on the money about desi parents in my case i wasnt allowed to be friends with non muslim kids and i didnt get along with any kids in my community so i just stayed home and kept to myselfit is really a cycle of suffering because in middle school youre teased for your social awkwardness and you go into your shell even more and that increases your social awkwardness more am i correct that socialization is sort of a nuanced skill like any other there are many unsaid rules when you converse and interact with people and these rules cant be taught theyre almost unconscious and if youre unaware of these rules of socialization because of your lack of experience youre seen as weird
1684	1	gti think its unthinkable for most people in india that parents dont act in the best interests of their childthis is probably one of the most ridiculous personality traits that i have seen in indian people even if your parents treat you like shit and are horrible people they expect you to respect and obey themexampleone of my closest online friends is a 19 yo girl living in india both her parents are doctors so she lives a privileged lifestyle i saw that she has her own mercedes frequently goes out with her friends and parties is allowed to have a boyfriend and will be soon attending an art college in new york for a masters degree in fashion design paid for by her parentsshe knows all the shit that i go through and how my parents have treated me because ive known her for a while one time i casually told her jeez i hate my parents and she got super offended she told me i would not be here if it were not for my parents and no matter how it seems like treat me they are doing it for my own good she literally stopped talking to me for 3 days just because i said thati find it very hypocritical for a person who has never lived in my shoes to make such an audacious statement
1685	1	neither me or my fiancé are particularly religious and have decided that well expose our kids to religion and let them decide my fiancé never followed a religion growing up and i grew up sikh but honestly dont care i do think its important for our kids to know about their culture but i wont be forcing them into anything i definitely think its important to have a conversation with your so about it especially if youre leaning towards marriage your families dont need to have any say in how your decide to raise your kids
1686	1	thissometimes my white friends online will have days where they are feeling upset or frustrated i want to be a good friend and supportive but when i hear the actual reason why they are upset i have a hard time taking them seriously

1693	1	this is taking me back to grad school there are so many texts i want you to know about but theyre all terribly hard to read and can get pretty boring the below books are not by any means the books to read about nationalism identity and diaspora but i read all of them when i was in grad school not as required reading but research i didnt link homi bhaba is location of culture because it is very very dense and hard to get through it is one of key works in postcolonial studies that examines cultural hybridity it is also unreadable at times in my post i mention benedict anderson who wrote imagined communitieshttpsbooksgooglecombooksidnq9jxxjvvgcampprintsec which is where he really delves into origins of nationalism and where he discussed the concept of long distance nationalism inderpal grewal wrote transnational america feminisms diasporas neoliberalismshttpsbooksgooglecombooksid0cjag3yygec and it is a really interesting look at how to concept of america travels across borders via consumerism as well as what it means to become american anita mannur wrote culinary fictions food in south asian diasporic culturehttpsbooksgooglecombooksaboutculinary_fictionshtmlidblbg5twklecampprintsecfrontcoverampsourcekp_read_buttonvonepageampqampffalse which is really focuses on food as part of cultural identity there is also a pretty interesting book called bollywood weddings dating engagement and marriage in hindu americahttpsbooksgooglecombooksidy2mpn1zfdhkcampdqhybridindianamericanidentityampsourcegbs_navlinks_s which is not as dense as the other books i recommended but more of an applicationdiscussion of concepts like hybridity and transnationalism
1694	1	90 of pakistani canadians are below the poverty line and 70 of them marry their cousins it is from a harvard study so i trust these stats

1699	1	i dont think people are trying to be divisive with the terms its just helpful when trying to describe your life and experiences a person who grows up immersed in a certain culture and country will have different experiences than someone born into that culture in a different country essentially what im saying is people born in india have different experiences with being indian than indians born elsewhere especially western countries these things are important when we have discussions
1700	1	they think hes mexican
1701	1	hanson for real
1702	1	there are always parents so mentally incapacitated or sick that they need to be looked after professionally  but there are also a lot of grandparents that end up in retirement homes simply because like you said it is stressfull to look after after them while leading normal lives  people need people to live and be motivated diverse people  young old kids old people cannot live with dying people and be motivated to live this is more a cultural thing than anything else looking after new born kids  is stressful looking after a ill spouse is stressful  and yet people do it leaving a ailing spouse like newtrudy did is considered bad  but grandparents not so muchveterans are screwed over 401k and pensions can be looted no laws to prevent it and now medicare and social security are under threat the sad part is people dont understand the loneliness until they are too old and unable to do anything about it
1703	1	lifestyle changes such as losing weight diet and exercise should always come first however in some people these are not enough to control their cholesterol levels and a statin is necessary a statin is sustainable for these people its taken once at night
1704	1	true true but id take her over bobby jindal he actively rejects his hindu identity while she adopted it
1705	1	to me it seems like society causes women to grow up sooner and doesnt allow them to mess up while guys get boys will be boys if there was really such a mental difference in brain development why are both genders in the same age in the same grade
1706	1	why would you say something so controversial yet so brave
1707	1	wait i thought they were a half day ahead isnt it monday for them

1711	1	oh they already are match rates are steadily on the decline
1712	1	listen bro i understand you cant think logically when it comes to sikhs because it you belong to an echo chamber on this sub keep working and shining on your hindu nationalist propaganda though no wonder indian retired army officers say that india cant counter pakistani propaganda online simple reason is because they have people like you ranting nonsensicallybhagat singh is hailed as a hero even though he was a convicted murdered or was he a khalistani too utterly reprehensible that the choice of rosy view depends on your own bias and not an educated learned methodology sikhs dont glorify terrorists or extremism of any sort at all what is valuable to us is justice just look at last 34 years and say if we have gotten any justice for the 1984 antisikh genocide not a single hindu was killed in any retaliation from the sikhs for this genocide even in punjab where sikhs are in majority after terrorists killed hindus in punjab and haryana during bus attacks normal everyday hindus killed sikhs in delhi and haryana can you see the dichotomy here terrorists killed hindus and instead hindus went after normal sikh citizens sikh kids underwear was searched in delhi yes they were molested by teachers all because the purported mother of hindus indira gandhi was assassinated you took in the propaganda that indira gandhi was mother of hindus and hence needs to be avenged pretty well look at what is happening in india right now hindu terrorists killing police forces hindu supremacist organization rss openly calling christians and muslims as pests that need to be eradicated hindu nationalists want to erect a temple in place of a mosque now say are we the baddies inspite of all this sikhs will be proud and will never ever try to please or belong to india and this is where it gets your goat that why sikhs dont praise india this is the root cause of every mundane analysis that why do sikhs not praise india look at pakistan and shit hole they are sikhs live so good in india is the rote and oftrepeated analysis of nearly every hindu nationalist guess what give justice it is high time you have shielded hindus who have killed and lit sikh pyres and put tyres around our fathers is necks we are raising our voice only you see it as weapons and that is not our problem
1713	1	i dont know where you live but i have observed many desi be difficult to waiters at nondesi places

1716	1	i know the basics of java do you think that will be good enough
1717	1	youre an extreme example and far from the norm then do you live in an area where there arent a lot of black people because i have heard many stories about indian dudes being beat up as well both because of the association with muslism and terrorism but also because we are percieved to be easier targets due to media image also most indians get better grades than most blacks so it makes sense why they would say that many people are under the delusion that indians cant play sports so it goes both ways
1718	1	unless we become mods then get in line plebs
1719	1	they hate him and his family because of their background my parents think his family are white trash and uneducated because some of them including my bf have not sought higher education furthermore it doesnt help that my parents are close with another family that almost has a rivalry with my boyfriends family also as i think i may have mentioned before my bf was kind of promiscuous as a young adult my parents never had the chance to see him grow up theyve come up with many reasons to hate him and ive always begged them to just once give him a chance ive even told them that they can meet him and scream at him for hours or confront him about every problem they have with him because he and i would both interpret that as progress but they adamantly refuse
1720	1	classical dancing is still present in bangali communities but you tend to not see it it in religious populations
1721	1	not to mention in a lot of cases the food served in these restaurants mostly punjabi in the uk would be very similar if not the exact same a few miles east across the border calling it indian food rather than pakistani food just causes less headaches when it comes to marketing like you mentioned
1722	1	anytime fam
1723	1	it was a joke  take it easy mate
1724	1	i think it is extremely interesting how a group can basically play both sides the proisraeli lobby cant ever be criticized without a politician risking his or her career

1735	1	how do you remain productive like that i cant really think straight when i do intermittent fasting so it has to be when i have nothing to do
1736	1	lmao learned something new today
1737	1	what blanks exactly does it fill in its not like there is some special super egregious joke that was only recorded in that one article its just the event from the perspective of one person with strong opinions
1738	1	hi im doing good thank you how about yourself
1739	1	he is not muslim he is an exmuslim also you can be progressive and still have your spouse convert by their choice it is no different from people changing churches to their spouses one just so they can raise their kids in that church
1740	1	theoretically possible that jagmeet singh could be pm but realistically i dont see it happening not so much because he is sikh but more because he is ndp and not as politically savvy as jack layton although apparently jagmeet speaks french very well i think he studied in france which may mitigate the turban among some quebecois itll be interesting to see what happens on the campaign trailstill i remember back in the 80s the liberal party did well in ontario in part because of a strategy of running immigrant candidates in immigrantheavy ridings it worked well for a long time less so now since other parties do it too i think not long ago brampton was literally a singh vs singh vs singh race so it was a general pandering of sorts for a while bc briefly had a desi premier though
1741	1	i squat 340 and bench 80 i look kinda like a trex lol my upper body is not biomechanically blessed

1749	1	you want me to believe a dating app with 31 reviews most of which are calling it a scam and asking for their money to be refunded rated at 25 stars has a 18 million user base and accurately compiled data to reflect dating trends in any significant matter do you understand what it means to check the organization behind studies and determine how valid they might be its one of the first lessons you learn in any research based program you want me to choose this over papers coming out from columbia and other far more reputable sources describing their methodology and sources showing that asian men and black women consistently fair the worst in online and real life datingeven okcupids results are far more reputable than anything from that article
1750	1	dang really it definitely has issues but ive met a guy off of dil mil and it went decently well
1751	1	i cant really fix what op is been through but this is very good advice

1758	1	it is also self fulfilling if you assume someone is going to tip less and therefore provide lower quality service they are going to end up tipping you less for the service you provided
1759	1	im not sure if this is cultural appropriation this is a trend you see across immigrant groups in the united states americanitalian americanmexican what we call texmex in texas americanchinese even stuff like sushi has been americanized california roll if you never left america you might get the false impression that is called indian or chinese or italian may not be something that is actually served often in india china or italy i think this is what happens when immigrants you know immigrant something is lost something is gained and something new is created
1760	1	i do yes even more than you how is that relevant here
1761	1	better than us being currently exploited by the left who want us to accept and endorse affirmative action a policy that actively harms usminority empowerment only means blacks and latinos for the dems cause thats where the votes are the dont care about asians yet we still follow their beck and call because minorities are supposed to be democrats
1762	1	probably because you abcds are too easy to impress is sorta condescendingi didnt downvote you or really have a problem w the comment but i can see why people would
1763	1	this is so true when i live at home for a while or i go to india i literally lose weight with minimal exercise you dont have to use all that ghee and butter for everything and you can get so much protein from a basic indian veg diet
1764	1	seema bhatt is hilarious
1765	1	drink i am curious about the world and confident about life so i just keep doing what i want sometimes youre sad other times happy its life
1766	1	im not going to question your experiences not because i fully believe or sympathize with you but simply because i wasnt there to witness them i lack a context to what you said so i cannot judge you either waygtwhen we come to india make us feel welcomethis triggered me im in my late thirties so im probably older than a large number of people here my view of abcds has been shaped by three decades of interactions with themi didnt grow up in india i grew up in the uae in the eighties and early 90s growing up in the close knit there we often came into contact with abcd kids visiting relatives living in my town those kids holy shit nothing we had was ever good enough for them they turned their noses up at everything our clothes food homes cars toys you name it and their parents they either ignored the behavior or they apologized for it not once did i see the kids being disciplined or even reprimanded for their behavior mind you we lived in the uae so we had nice things it was still not good enough nothing was these kids hated being there being around us doing things with us and having anything to do with usin fact before my family traveled to india for vacations my parents would sit us down and repeat the dos and donts of how to behave while in india along with that we got a strong dose of dont you dare act out around your cousins like ltinsert name of the latest abcd we had the misfortune of meetinggt behaved when he she was here or there will be hell to paywhen i was older i had the misfortune of meeting with older abcds in my interactions with abcds i rarely felt anything other than hostility towards people like me or a feeling of being patronized the hostile ones didnt want us around and the patronizing ones tried pretended to be so nice that it was obvious it was fake the common theme in all interactions was the vibe that abcds are deeply embarrassed of fobs some are angry about it hence the hostility others have come to accept it so the fake niceness and patronizing behaviori have never been made to feel welcome by the vast majority of abcds i have interacted with lots of other fobs on this thread and elsewhere have echoed my experiences so it is not just me hell dont even make me feel welcome if you dont want to hate me all you want but if you do hate me as an equal not out of contempt for my national origingtif you respect us we will show you the same respect backto reiterate what i said above dont respect me if you dont want to dont like me if you dont feel like it go ahead and dislike me all you want but treat me as an equal when you do it that is all i ask to be treated as an equal even if it is combined with contempt or dislike
1767	1	i understand but if you argue by that term only you are only arguing against a particular person or belief not against a particular relationship there is a difference in the end if either party disagree on something they can just part ways and move onif a person decide to convert by full choice and conscience and not by force which is not always apparent and i suggest you to assume positive rather than preemptively bash then no matter for what reason you cannot hold your own judgement for that after all they say love conquers all if they dont want to convert because they value their own dignity and freedom then let them be if both parties decide on some compromise then let them be you dont like a guy who promotes his own cultural superiority to you fine but others are apparently chill with it enough for them to decide a huge change in their livesyou may as well have prejudice on everybody who convert to a certain religion by claiming that they are brainwashed while they themselves dont feel so
1768	1	which makes me sad
1769	1	self reported figures  lol
1770	1	ok then i dont understand why tanning isnt stigmatized but trying to become fairer is if its about health i mean skin tanning increases ur risk of cancer and hundreds of millions of people still do it it also damages your skin due to lack of melanin and sunburns are no joke uv radiation literally damages your dna why is none of that a concern at all it seems very disingenous

1772	1	hidey ho fella if you want we can spend the rest of our lives bringing up stats where hindus killed muslims and muslims killed hindus its happened before and it probably will happen again but the thing is is that its up to us to learn from it and help prevent it but thats not what im gonna do what im trying to promote here is that we move on from it like respect each others boundaries and start coexisting rather than attacking each other as indians ive noticed that the bjp is trying to promote hate towards minorities in india which sucks because india is just as much as their country as it is everyone elses i think youre forgetting that the many minorities in india chose to remain there after the split because it is their country as well no country is without hate or prejudice my guy we just need to help combat it when we see it so we can live in peace i love india and im sure you do too it sucks that so many people are hating each other because of their religion we should help combat it im sorry hindus suffered at the hands of muslims and im sorry that muslims suffered at the hands of hindus but lets learn from it and move on towards a better india right sorry for baiting you earlier

1783	1	gtwrite a yelp reviewlol those reviews are hillarious to read check out any indian restaurants on yelp in negative reviews section there will one or two legitimate bad reviews but if it from a desi person it is definitely hillarious and outrageous something on the lines of servers didnt even smile i mean really when was the last time desi people smile at each other in public and make small talk in the us are they expecting whitewashed desi people to serve them or something another weird review would be something on the line of very bland and i can make better food at home or  i asked for spicy sambhar but it was too spicy and my poor apple of the eye kiddo could not eat any of the spicy sambhar i mean make up you mind people what do you really want at an indian restaurant and what kind of service do you want without tipping
1784	1	someones gotta pour in the money to fund social security theres way too many old people in this country and since the birth rate is at its lowest ever we need some immigrants to come in and fill that gapbuilding a wall is a dumb idea and a waste of money if he really wants a wall get mexico to pay for it like he promised what people were more outraged about were the child separations

1788	1	i never ever put them on a pedestal actually cause i grew up in a city that was full of east asians and i always had an asian fetish i never have understood the desi white pedestal bullshit its obviously quite sad esp since white american girls are not that attractive given the obesity and fashion of the us
1789	1	understating the actual amount is a thing its probably more like 5001000
1790	1	the us is not 77 white though lolits 60 white census white is not white in real life the census counts arabs latinos persians north africans and all middle easterners as white even counted north indian as white until 1972 correct but the us is so racially and culturally diverse that people are far more exposed to and open towards immigrants its also known for being a land of immigrants bc its the new world its not the same in europe where dominant cultures and bloodlines have been pretty much natives since 2000 years
1791	1	fob here wanted your advice on cliquey traits i have asked other fobs around me to use english when in public but they dont comply also the reason i hang out with other fobs is because i am a vegetarian and love indian food and only fobs are considerate in line with my dietary preferences

1799	1	to add to what i already said to pollute and to be wasteful will always be more profitable than to be ecological
1800	1	read the last sentence of my post again  in my experience indian americans of both genders approach indian culture in a very biased way  they get defensive when others make comments about indian culture that are quite frankly justified and accurate  they parade around in indian clothes while refusing to acknowledge the systemic injustices experienced by actual indians who wear those clothesi think a lot of this has to do with the fact that indian americans tend to be very privileged people  to those who have experienced oppression and discrimination firsthand it is impossible to separate the good from the bad  just like how the confederate flag is valued by some southerners but reviled as a symbol of oppression by others  to me it is impossible to parade around the culture of my ancestors without a feeling of guilt towards those who have suffered as a result of it
1801	1	are you claiming a chaiwalla an obc considered economically disadvantaged by the indian gov only cares about brahmins and upper castes

1822	1	not sure what you mean by tribalism but there tends to be better blood match results within our own ethnic communities
1823	1	well if she likes him and wants to be married to him thats fine but use all the birth control you can and go adopt some children the two of them just cannot have biological children together so even a test tube situation wouldnt work unless they used someone elses egg or spermim saying they dont have to divorce but they have to do something

1832	1	married a christain and can confirm this
1833	1	gt i guess i just dont want to be tied downsounds like youre not interested in a relationship if so then be honest about your intentions up front  that youre not looking for anything serious and stop imagining women as your future gfwifeif you do genuinely want a relationship then you have to reevaluate yourself and your behavior the chase is always more thrilling than settling down but that doesnt mean settling down is unfun and ends your life you can always try seeing a therapist and getting a different perspective on things and try to figure out your goals my personal opinion youre young if you dont want to get tied down go out have your fun while being honest and upfront with the people you get involved in and worry about settling down later
1834	1	gtyou could be a productive member of a society and still choose to live in a closed community and follow the norms of that parallel societygreat that is the creation of a parallel society now where do you draw the line for when those norms become problematic obviously i draw it when they trump individual human rights like if fundamentalist mormons dont let their daughter marry whoever they want then that is not integration because they arent conforming with the law gtsure if that community wants to use legal and democratic avenues to have the laws of the land changed well then thats just part in parcel of democracies you dont have to like it but it has nothing to do with your ideas regarding integration wtf does this have to do with anything gtthe fact that youre trying to argue that you a pakistani and an exmuslim simply adds to my position honestly at this point i couldnt care less what you think of me gtwell than that would mean youd have to follow the cultural norms instead of calling it the worst thing ever while you can have you beliefs youd still have to act as a muslim in a country that is 98 muslim your kids would eventually assimilate and become muslims im kind of digging your idea of integration already interesting point we will get to it  gtour agreement doesnt mean when low breeding countries with a high economic output which requires foreign labor are going to start acting proactively when drafting their immigrant integration policies maybe one day they might but for now they draft their institutional and state level integration policies as a fix for things they realize arent workingwell they should and lot is of countries are changing that right now the next set of elections and europe and elsewhere will be a bit biggtthen that would mean since pakistan is a communal society that requires conformity non muslim minorities and exmuslims should be forced to integrate in to the majority of pakistani society that went completely over your head didnt it individual rights trump communal rights gtthen that would mean since pakistan is a communal society that requires conformity non muslim minorities and exmuslims should be forced to integrate in to the majority of pakistani society again you are conflating integrating and assimilating assimilating means letting your children if they so choose become christian in america or muslim in pakistan since you are conflating the two so often i think you might want to check the dictionary gtintegration so you should take catholicism and christianity classes where you live right now good point gti dont think its a problem at all south asian culture doesnt put much weight on the individual is preferenceswell culture is irrelevant when compared to basic human rights gterving your purpose in a family is more important in south asian cultures obviously when you move into a society that prizes individualism the cultural clash will produce a lot of friction within families its the natural process of how things workagain see above gtcalling it good or bad is a narrow minded way of not seeing what is happening and complaining because of your own biases an objective approach is required to understand these issues well it actually is because individual rights protects your religion in the west if we existed communally as in pakistan christianity would be enforced and pressured on you gtan objective approach is required to understand these issues ah pretending to be objective are we rules for thee not for me

1851	1	this is one situation where i would like to point out the sheer breadth of experiences relating to south asians there is an incredible amount of diversity within the desi population as a whole as a mallu christian desi the idea of forced marriage of women at the age of 16 is completely foreign to me and it is foreign to my parents as well whether mine or your experience is what defines being desi is a question that i think is beyond both of us
1852	1	if you use the literal definition prejudice against people of other races or believing that a particular race is superior to another i have yet to find a uncleauntyfob that hasnt said racist thing where it be against blacksmexicanschinesemuslimsjewsgayscastesbiharislolpercentage wise they are the most racist group but actual racist crimes whites are probably highest but then again we live in a white dominated country if you look at india and pakistan hindu nationalists and muslims are 100x worse because they are the majority and if you dont believe misogynyprejudice against women is pretty bad in our patriarchal culture then you must be living under a rock

1866	1	it is a little bit of both it isnt technically a theocracy because the sikhs spiritual head isnt a person it is the guru granth sahib sikhs in the 60s in order to get more sovereignty divided what was west punjab into 3 states sikh majority punjab hindu haryana and hindu himachal pradesh the khalistani supporters want pretty much what used to be the sikh empire for sikhs it includes punjab in pakistan rajasthan  kashmir and a bunch of other indian statesthey wanted to impose sikh religious laws on the population of these areas whether they are sikh hindu muslim etc

1871	1	gt clearly what im saying has some merit considering the responses in this thread considering most everyone here disagrees with you and your post and comments are all downvoted no not that reddit responses really matter but if that is what you wanna go by it doesnt really help your case lmao gt responses like yours really just highlight what im talking aboutyou know what man ill chill out for a second tell me in depth what my response proves ill definitely consider it gt i dont care if you have respect for megoodgt why would i care what a troll account sayswhat makes you think this a troll account you go through my history

1876	1	im sorry i came here to be entertained not personally attacked
1877	1	i risk getting downvoted and agree with your sentiment ive watched him for years from before all the nazi stuff and the bridge and if people had any context theyd know he is not racist but he can try to be too edgy sometimes and get carried away he doesnt care about the numbers and he was surprised that he even beat tseries to 69m in the first place the whole thing with him trying to beat tseries is a joke and he embraces that you cant go making this a whites vs browns thing its internet culture being internet culture
1878	1	more like what they are being manipulated to think about the issue by their corrupt leaders

1880	1	yeah i volunteer sometimes and go for hikes nothing hardcore though maybe i should be more adventurous and try mountain climbing i do art stuff as well but most of it is execrable quality approaching dudes at the gym scare me for some reason  always feels like im bothering them or interrupting their workout

1890	1	you can download an srt file or i believe a few other formats and open it up using vlc or a lot of other desktop media players it can be added to a video file mp4 etc though some video file formats can also contain subtitle data eg mkvhighly recommended in general there is a plugin for vlc vlsubhttpsaddonsvideolanorgp1154045 it is free which tries to automatically download the right subtitle file for your video using the database at opensubtitlesorghttpsopensubtitlesorg by matching using either filename or hash it probably wouldnt automatically work for dvd rips or something but it usually does for video files obtained using digital stores or other means

1893	1	yep and a paralell thing happened in europe these protoindoeuropeans who came from the steppecaucasus region moved into eastern europe and further and mixed with the natives there who where already a mix of anatolianmiddle eastern farmers and european huntergatherers the pure eastern farmers where light skinned while the pure european hunter gatherers where darkskinned this new protoindoeuropean mixture gave rise to the modern europeans so the aryan migration into south asia was not done by white people they where more similar looking to modern north indians and persians
1894	1	yo never denied just deflecred typical
1895	1	nobody was arguing that punjabis want an independent state they dont teach you how to read in indian schools or what put your critical thinking cap on and explain to me how a country that saw a violent genocide 30 years ago has just suddenly and without friction resolved all tension youre telling me no differences exist along ethnic religious and class lines in india and that there is no friction as a resultindia is a paradise of unity that has never been seen before on earth and the whole world should look to

1900	1	personally if im doing anything past makingout with one of the girls i stop anything physical with other girls im talking to but that is just me i think the acceptable thing is that if you guys havent talked about being exclusive then whatever is technically fine but if yall are fooling around for more than a month or two and especially a few months that shit needs to be talked aboutaddressed or that is gonna end in a hot mess and might regardlessi had a girl id been talking tell me later that she was sleeping around with other guys at the same time as we were talking and fooling around a bit and that put me in a weird funk for a while so i decided that my personal cutoff was before that point thinking along goldenrule logic but i also acknowledge that we hadnt talked about it but it still hurt like hell and was a blow to the old selfesteem

1908	1	so youre judging all pakistani is cause some guy you dated was unhygienicwhat a catch you must be
1909	1	this is what i experienced and desi women around me they had to deal with sexism ageism and lack of freedom while the male relatives got freedom to whatever they wanted to do all the time for example none of my brown friends were allowed to travel until there were either married or 30s also not being allowed to date was another the whole concept of raising daughters to be good wives and marry them off before 30 the thing is youd go out into the world and realize you have alot options but would require you to go against the grain and fight with backward parents that hold you back while for other women its a given and they have support from the parentsrelatives most of the timemy children if i have any especially my daughter wouldnt have to go through this just to enjoy life id support and trust her instead of just blocking opportunities and living in the past  time capsule effect

1924	1	is it though  the caste system and severe income inequality in india have had profound impacts on many families for centuries  they have explicitly affected the way that many indians view career options and in turn have also implicitly shaped the mindsets of many indian americansampx200bi dont really need to dive into the rich history of sexism on the indian subcontinent do i  just because we dont like sexism doesnt mean that it is not important to the definition of indian culture
1925	1	some of my russian friends have told me that bollywood is very popular where theyre from as well
1926	1	i feel it is the other way around hindus dont go up posting antisikh and antimuslim rhetoric the most i have seen was regarding the pakistani grooming gangs but casteism right wingism hindu nationalism gets brought here daily let is not forget the brigdaging from subs like chutyapa we had a similar problem with bakchodi earlier this year but that stopped when mods took active action on it the hindus here are literally posting sjw articles about food music etc we dont post anything political or degrading to other religions
1927	1	in the case of black eyed peas they usually give credit whenever they do sample desi songs william is a pretty big fan of indian music and usually mentions the original writers name on the record labela lot of indian producers like pritam and anu malik are known for straight up ripping off songs wout ever giving due credit to the original artists
1928	1	we dont bring this up and try to pass it off as a demand of the terrorists we say it to drive home a point pre1947 sikhs were in a minority in what is now indian punjab sikhs are in the majority in one of the states of india for only two reasons1 they were ethnically cleansed from their homeland2 the indian government gave them land and relocated them in the modern indian state of punjab on a personal note my grandfather was involved in this process of rehabilitation of these refugeesthe killings that these people had fled were several times in magnitude to anything that happened in 1984 at the hands of the congress party and its worthless when a big tree falls leadersgiven these circumstances the indian government is under no obligation  legal or moral to give them independence

1949	1	yes exactly the wall is a logistical nightmare that even his party is reluctant to cosign yet he is digging in his heels over it and has shut down the government out of his own stubbornness it is not difficult to see why supporting trump is views in this matter is an unpopular opinion

1963	1	i posted this below i dont believe mr khiladi is being very fair to yougt data science is broad as fuck though there are people out there with pol sci degrees with no serious mathematical training making pretty graphs and calling themselves data scientists they might have even done a masters in ds taken a couple businessy classes in pythongt gt then there are people with phds in statsmathecon whove been building proper models for 5 years are wellversed in theory and know what they are doing they are also data scientistsgt gt then again if you can teach yourself svms pca and neural networks without taking any advanced classes or doing research you call yourself whatever the fuck you want lol

1969	1	its definitely not a word used positively in most situations also most south asians who grew up outside south asia dont eat curry every day so why be associated with it not like white people go around calling themselves cheese people or sausage people koreans dont cal themselves kimchis garlic eater is actually a highly offensive slur used on koreans in japanbeing associated with a strong odor is at best like reappropriating a slur why desi is a fine neutral word
1970	1	aww that little baby girl  ill share this with family and friends
1971	1	when did i say it was wrong i was trying to point that people  gets surprised when i say english is common denominator for indians from different parts of the country not indian language they think we all speak same language hindi  some even think we have language called indian
1972	1	would it be okay if i decided to block you because first of all you wouldnt even even legit advice beside providing somebody else handy work information theres lot of people in stock market business and some of them became millionaires also i didnt state that stock share will be my full time job and to even start off with any stocks you need to buy it with your income so you should have some cash stored for you in the savings account theres lot of people gain and lose money but at the end of the day it all about how you handle your stocks and how much you lose
1973	1	youre right but top subscriber count is one of those bragging rights things so it is understandable why it is drawing attention so tseries crossing it even one would be noteworthy it is a competition of their pdp fans own making tseries represents a large part of the music industry of india so it is not surprising that its subscriber count is going up as more and more indians get internet accessbut since pewdiepie fans have made it personal everyone is just climbing aboard the hate train
1974	1	they are more than welcome to apply for asylum and immigrate legally the problem i had specifically with the recent caravan was that most of them could have easily decided to migrate to mexico they were out of their country where the supposed danger was coming from they were coming to the us for economical reasons
1975	1	in the states from my experience undergrads are usually upper class people who have been in english schools for most of their lives they still clique together but it is no different than the rest of the student population

1977	1	that overreferenced okcupid data is fairly clear evidence that society is implicitly racist but it rarely if ever gets presented that way ive only ever seen it referenced on this website as supposed evidence of white superiority or as a tool to justify stereotypes against minorities
1978	1	true
1979	1	hey man i genuinely enjoyed reading about your family is journey to their current diet and yours as well gt lot of them have cut back on dairyseriously stuff like this is really heartening to readgtgoing out with a girlso i had this vegan roommate two years back her strategy was what she called flirt and convert find a cute omnivore and then convert him to vegan by feeding him delicious vegan food haha have you tried introducing her to vegan ideasim assuming that youre a guy even if things dont work out well there is absolutely no way that the ratio of vegan women to men is any lower than 41 with those odds i have full faith in your abilities to win
1980	1	always gotta find the desis
1981	1	fair and lovely yarrs
1982	1	gtyou dont think there is anything wrong about people coming here without any sort of paper trail or documentation or any sort of background check for criminal historyyes there is something wrong with rewarding illegal immigration rewarding illegal immigration is rewarding policy violations at the expense of all others who wait in line legally
1983	1	im 57 and he was 56
1984	1	why did they go back to india india was in a extremely worse state in the 60s  famines and stuff

1988	1	that is the some dumb shit if its part of the culture it is not racist imo and the way you went about targeting it seems interesting and well done its like the gay guy from weeds id rather see a 3d character than some dumb man woman for the sake of some  interracial dynamic
1989	1	old age homes cost a lot even if most people are on medicare there is a lot more stress financially and emotionally when your elderly parents are healthy and wasting their life away at a nursing home
1990	1	gt the guy isnt muslimhe regularly refers to himself as a muslim in interviews and speeches he just doesnt practise the religion
1991	1	thats v interesting fam
1992	1	americans think theyre such manly men adulting by drinking black coffee come back when youre taking espresso shots like the rest of us
1993	1	that applies to christianity islam and judaism not just one of the three it is obvious youre trying to single out islam but there is been multiple instances of nonmuslims coexisting with muslims in muslim majority places joe rogan isnt a good source on anything outside of combat sportsof course now that we live in the developed world religions are vestigial and not necessary for a good moral compass
1994	1	whats this about paedophilia ive never heard of any incident like that
1995	1	so many biryani ruined
1996	1	damn all the more reason to shave my beard
1997	1	nah he is a mix of many things even chinese it seems most likely identifies with his black ancestry the most i wouldnt consider him one of us at all
1998	1	totally agree it has made me want to cook more
1999	1	solid advice
2000	1	this is such bullshit i dont know a single abcd family that would be okay with forced marriage this includes indians and pakistanis ive met one or two abcds who were actually abused the rest had completely fine family lives it annoys me to see how dim of a view people have of their own culture  extrapolating their shitty families to the entire culture
2001	1	can i see the video where he calls out these people for being perverts
2002	1	dont forget where you came from and any help you got pass it forwardthere seems to be a schism regarding your mode of arrival here in the us at least there are the h1bsprofessionals who came directly to relatively well paying jobs here and dont know much about the initial struggle i would add the fully scholarshiped stem people in gradschool as well into this groupsecond group is the ones that had to really hustle and find jugad to make it here i dont know why for some reason the first group does not like the second group so many of our prejudices are brought from the old country and then there are the hybrids like my family we came from a fairly upper middle class background in india here we really had to struggle for the first few years but doing well now
2003	1	yes ive lived and travelled almost all over the world the uk is 88 white in the latest census the us is 6065 white it is by far the most diverse western nation and canada doesnt come close the uk is not a country founded on immigration and outside 12 big cities no one will consider you a real brit its just the factual reality of living in europe english people have other europeans immigrating there much less indians or asians or africans
2004	1	it is stigmatized but definitely not to the extent of becoming fairer im not necessarily saying one is worse than the other but the roots of where the fairness beauty standards come from is what continues to harm the desi society like ive said i dont know much about tanning myself just a bit from the western perspective ive felt the effects of not being fair enough but never of not being dark enough i can speak more on my own experiences
2005	1	i was rather surprised that none mentioned india given that kohinoor diamond is part of their crown jewels and india has asked them to return it
2006	1	but how do we get to the point where we judge people by the content of their character and not color of skin this kind of makes me uncomfortable like when do people become just people rather than racial groups
2007	1	once i was old enough and especially if here werent other people my age at a party i would go and hang out near my dad and his friends because i was more interested in what they were talking about it and no one said anything no one told me to leave but the atmosphere would just change and you could tell people found it weird this would also happen when we visited india because long story short i know my uncles  aunts better than i know my cousins
2008	1	it is an old generation thing even one side of my family believes in blind obedience no matter if they treat you kindly or not it may have worked back in the day but it surely doesnt work in today is world
2009	1	will be converting it to store in my harddrive so i can hook it to the projector rest of dvds will be stored in a safe box and stored in shelf
2010	1	it isnt problematic at all sati is banned today europeans used to burn witches middle eastern people used to stone women who where cheating africans still to this day take over nearby villages and kill the men there and take young girls as rape slavesyou cant use something like that as an argument to paint an entire culture in a way when hindu culture changes from city to city and not all indians are hindu but you lack the intelligence to realize these simple things i can sleep fine but someone like you must really hate yourself to force yourself to believe in your own pathetic lies
2011	1	no doubt we even have conclusive evidencehttpsyoutube8tw7liykvbw
2012	1	exactly the concepts of religion overall are basically good general life rules
2013	1	she is not a neoliberal hw bush was a neoliberal i dont know what to call her other than an opportunist
2014	1	oh piss off guys of all races can act like that women can act like that stop judging the many by the actions of a few idiot
2015	1	whoa usa had diversity visa for indians too
2016	1	ever tried egg dosa
2017	1	eggs in my dosa gaspampx200bthat is blasphemy
2018	1	actually affirmative action helps white women the most out of any other group poverty is the cause of high crime statistics which are even higher due to police departments being biased war on drugs and a broken prisonlegislative system the poverty in african american communities is very much linked to slavery jim crow laws redlining  segregation etc maybe you should go read a history book once in a while before you go off spewing shit out of your arse you fuckhead
2019	1	isnt that a person that hates women
2020	1	it began with denial and family thinking that i was being unreasonable took professional help and learned more about my issues cognitive behavioral therapy helped a lot not saying it cured me but i am able to keep myself in check more than i was able to when i was younger
2021	1	yup that is right
2022	1	even if there is only person that supports they have the right to believe in that idea you cant control people
2023	1	how is it appeasing modi and yogi the khalistanis have been anticongress and tbh viceversa for decades now
2024	1	i hate that mentality if jews the most white noneuropean race  can call out racism and be successful we should too
2025	1	gt its all the same cashew paste  heavy cream gravy in every curryindian food is expensive to make and labor costs are high when it comes to cooking indian food using paste is the way to keep costs down its purely a business decision and could explain why indian cuisine has not taken off in fast casual sector but remains in sit down restaurantsbuffets
2026	1	the dating culture is pretty bad though many girls want to play a fuckton of games before showing theyre interested and in the end want to marry an nri lmao
2027	1	did we just become friends
2028	1	and i will never not call people like you jealous
2029	1	yeah a common british phrase lets go for an indian
2030	1	lol fuck off incel you think we cant see your post history
2031	1	oh but there arelike the hippy couple who brought all of their vaguely south asian bullshit into a panera while i was eating a roast beef sandwich imagine eating a roast beef sandwich while saraswati stares you downalso she told us her husband was reading the quran in sanskrit when it was clearly just in arabic because i can see the fucking pagei hate hippiesedit some more details because it was wayyyy weirder than i made it soundi was like 16 at the time and everything she said got more and more confusingshe also had like plants and some other statues and she kept fiddling with beads on saraswati she spoke in this sort of light singsongy voice her husband didnt do anything other than drag his finger along the page of his quran like a 5 year old pretending to read he refused to look my mom and me in the eye just kinda looked past us and nodded and went uhhuh to everything his wife saidmy mom usually loved when white people get into desi shit because she was far too trusting but since then shes kinda changed her view on it hearing them talk was like a strange dream where random shit ive seen in my life hindu idols gold leaf qurans roast beef sandwiches white people gets mashed together in a completely incoherent waytbh it doesnt seem like they were high at least at the time never know with these fuckin hippies knowwhatimsayin so it made it weirder this was near sf
2032	1	that is the slippery slope i am talking abouti am not blind i know how brutal the mughal conquest wasmy undergrad was in india in a muslim school i have seen some of the motherfuckers with osama bin laden is picture as their wallpaper but even such extreme right wing islamists had no narrative about shaming anyone about the conquestsi am not romanticising the past but rather asking to focus on the democratic values of todayhypothetically if we are here revisiting the events 400 years ago why cant i go even further not to mention if lord ram is a god or not since we are revisiting history anyway
2033	1	talk to me when india does those things again youre making shit up to back up a claim why am i here because im an american desi i dont care about the ancestral aspects or the cultural aspects im here to associate with other desi people like me who feel the same way folks like you however think that just because somebody doesnt participate in the circle jerk or why anything desi related is amazing doesnt mean that they arent allowed here ive met way too many people like you on this sub that act like a gatekeeper either way is this sub only to talk about ancestral stuff no theres the aspect of talking to other desis and finding a common ground and sharing experiences you sound like a fucking moron never once in this thread did i say anything good about pakistan nor am i acting like pakistan is better youre literally assuming that because of the flair next to my name im more anti pakistan than i am anti india but were not talking about pakistan here we dont need a unifying voice we need more people who have the balls to point out the problems that these countries face not pretend like they dont exist because it makes us feel better about ourselves youve done nothing but assume crap since youve replied to me it would help if you asked questions instead of assuming im an antiindian propakistan heathen
2034	1	can i pm you mine as well
2035	1	gtageing heavilyfirst off agingsecond off you are on crack she is still hot as fuck
2036	1	that is exactly why i used that statementcouldnt be friends with anyone who wasntisnt a muslim couldnt interact with anyone who isnt a desi especially if theyre hindu which hilariously contradicts the first half of this statement they couldnt keep their own rules straighthowever seeing as i married a caucasian my cousin is now engaged to a caucasian im sure my grandparents jimmies arent as rustled as when i married my wife but progress still
2037	1	you stopped eating beef because of your bf didnt you do that out of love hypocrisy much
2038	1	khaalistan would be carved out of india not canada i dont know how hard that is for you to understand
2039	1	i think all muslim hyderabadis speak urdu and hindu hyderabadis speak telugu yes
2040	1	searched on my own it is the himalaya restaurant
2041	1	wtf is cupping brah
2042	1	that was actually a fantastic read thanks for the resource whether those statements were made to get shit done or whether he truly believed it remains to be seen however my point of view has definitely broadened thank you
2043	1	i actually dont think its that ironic when you are a black thought leader in the 60s its hard to imagine taking inspiration from someone who didnt have antiblack feelings thats the sad thing about being black in america even today nearly everyone of consequence and most nonblack communities harbor deep anti black sentiments
2044	1	this is unfair some sikhs will get political others should have a choice not to and ive seen rupi kaur talk occasionally on political issues
2045	1	do you know of any more american desi centric movies im like tryna curate a list of films with predominantly american born indian casts
2046	1	come to the midwestsouth lol3500 could probably cover a 4 bedroom 23 bath along with parking and utilities if you dont live in the big cities
2047	1	wow that is pretty awful for them to say that about the rwandan president
2048	1	i mean many homeland girls still go for a lot of the arranged marriage traits like having a lot of wealth so on that front hes probably ok one thing that seems to be picking up speed tho is people not wanting to come to the us i think the kc shooting had a lot to do with it plus the potential lack of work opportunities in a visa and the desire for many to be close to their families
2049	1	gt bombing the shared microwave with strong scented fooddoesnt have to be fish though all desi food is super fragrant and will result in that fragrance considering much of the workindoors are sealed for heatingcooling purposes what should the appropriate desi behavior be in this situation
2050	1	consequently you can have great respect for your culture without consuming bollywood and pop indian media
2051	1	at least stick up for him when your mum is insulting him
2052	1	serious question  do you just downvote everything when your feelings are hurt
2053	1	there are some folks who indeed grew up in hispanic countries but are of an ancestry from elsewhere eg black latinos who are descendents of slaves brought over by the spanish   however the vast majority of latinos are mestizos an admixture of the natives of the americas and spaniards  mestizos look very different from spaniards  even many lighter skinned mestizos look different from whites due to their facial structure  you can focus on the census bureau is definition of whites which includes arabs latinos etc but the reality is that whites in this country do not consider hispanics arabs etc to be white
2054	1	dont forget uk has a overall population of 68 million while the us has a population of 360 million so the percentage is a little misleading
2055	1	yeah so capitalism awards the best and brightest my parents werent rich by any means in india yet they worked hard got degrees made it here and now we live fairly comfortably capitalism is beautiful and ive seen it firsthand
2056	1	you should make an effort guys cant do all the lifting for you especially considering how gossipy desi communities are
2057	1	those who have ever been a citizen of pakistan or bangladesh are not eligible for registration as an overseas citizen of india  httpwwwociregistrationcomoci_eligibilityhtmhttpwwwociregistrationcomoci_eligibilityhtm
2058	1	i definately think living in a more diverse area helps for sure for the far future it is something to keep in mind when raising kidsfor me it wasnt that i tried to reject the culture so much but i was just never apart of it nor even knew what it was because my mum never introduced me to it
2059	1	canadian desis dont even know much about hispanics
2060	1	true i dont think indians should marry outside their culture
2061	1	awkward me at 1920 years old could make female friends not too difficult my parents were the bigger barrier questioning why i would be late how exactly id know a girl that i mentioned why i was talking to them why i need to be talking to them that sort of thing if i was just allowed to be around women without all those issues it wouldve been been different namely not making me feel like a criminal for talking to a womandating was another story but suffice to say if i was in a bigger population area i wouldve dated successfully
2062	1	but how can i leave you in your ignorance thinking 70 million 9 year olds are racist what a sad world for you to live in let me help you pewdiepie is not racist and if you still believe he is please define racism for me so i might understand what you mean
2063	1	i disagree i think they actually see a difference between asians and latinos this is where that model minority myth probably helps many of them see that we as a whole are much more successful and lump us in on the good side there is also the fact that us getting jobs here isnt gonna make as much of a difference in their lives compared to the latino population since were not really blue collar workers
2064	1	i mean he is an established comedian already it isnt like the people behind this are campaigning for him to be firedi think he works at snl no one is really ruining his career or targetting him they just asked him to leave that one event because he was bombing and not funny if his careerjob was in jeopardy it would be a whole different game
2065	1	maybe my experiences are different travelling to other countries perhaps the type of women who like to travel are a bit more open minded also never really used dating apps so i cant speak on that end still as far as quality of life and feeling comfortable with the prevailing culture i cant imagine a better place to be for desis to than england

2067	1	right wingers actively supported 1984 genocide hindu nationalist organization rss idealogue nana ji deshmukh actively supported the genocide according to him the massacre of sikhs was not the handiwork of any group or antisocial elements but the result of a genuine feeling of anger among hindus of indiaadvani was the one leading the charge in delhi to protect hindus and advocated for mass imprisonment of sikhs it is absolutely vile to blame it just on congress rss actively supported and aided congress in extermination of sikhs
2068	1	yes and no there are some positive and neutral qualities that i associate with south asians but i either way cant relate toalso i now just have an understanding that many of these ethnic groups are just simply seperate communities like other european ethnicities which growing up i understood european identitiesi only understood indian identity in a very broad sense like most white people do at the same i never felt ashamed to say i was half indian when i was growing up never knew what it really meant though i started learning about indian culture via the internet and i travelled to india once a couple years ago

2103	1	you might be right but that is nonsequitur my main point is that things will happen when they happen and to not beat yourself up because youre comparing your life to someone else is
2104	1	i moved here when i was 17 and my parents still live in india almost everyone i know in india has way more freedom than the people on this sub most are upper middle or upper class and in a big city but some of the stuff i read on here is crazyin fact people in india seem to think that indian immigrants in america are very traditional my parents have warned me to be careful when dating them etc the common belief is that when people move to americawherever they get frozen in the time period when they moved and they think thats how india is and how things should be they transport indian culture from the 70s or 80s to america and try to live it out in 2018 without realizing that india has moved on and its no longer like that

2110	1	most abcds and even a lot of immigrants who got their green cards a decade ago are unaware or misinformed about the situation of the indian legal immigrants stuck in the queue almost all nationalities would get their pr within a couple of years of applying while the projected wait time for indian immigrants is more than a hundred years how does it make sense and if you point out that legislations like the now dead raise act would solve this issue you get downvoted because it also eliminates the diversity visa
2111	1	as a houston resident can confirm
2112	1	100 i wouldnt want to be around people that thought like that anyway
2113	1	in the case of india it might be true until the end of 90s  india had a controlled economy due to which the rupee was kept highly appreciated when the value was much lower the result was that the supply of dollars was lower as india wasnt earning much in foreign exchange they never used to lend dollars to students in foreign universities cause it was deemed unimportantit really did not matter how much money you had in indian currency the indian government did not exchange it for dollars

2142	1	gt i dont dwell in indian politics because i am an americanthis is relevant to american politics and american society yuba city is in the united states the funding sources for many of these movements are in united states and canada certain sikh communities lobby american politicians to change its foreign policies towards india on this issue see sikh boycott of one of the few indian origin us representative ami bera and his campaign relations with the sikh community in norther california
2143	1	what restaurant i am visiting houston and will scratch it off my list thanks to my anonymous venting post online i became aware of this
2144	1	never know what will happen always be optimistic
2145	1	well it is not easy living in an ongoing collapsing state  but instead of getting out like others do they bitch and moan  there is a lot to lament these days so i cant blame them
2146	1	yeah but what does that have to do with sikh nationalism and selfdeterminism  the terrorism is whole different thing
2147	1	the only reason this happened is because the black americans had far bigger numbers in the usa than we do and they also tried to incorporate other groups like the womens movement to increase their numbers thats why feminism and black rights are so intertwined they both protect each other because they both have to much to lose if they dont so it
2148	1	that really sucks growing up we really owe much of our survival in the states to another desi family who lived down the streets while we were pakistani muslims they were indian sikhs but non practicing they were working class as well both were bus drivers in the city they had a car and they actually helped my mom get her license so we could be a bit more mobilemy sister and i along with their kids were literally the only 2 desis in my school we used to carpool and they are probably one of my oldest friends that i still talk to every now and then even now only one of them went to college an ivy league at that and the other one went to the police academy and is now on the shortlist to become a detective last time i talked to him which is a pretty big dealas a result i have always been a firm believer that desis back in the 90s were a lot more friendlier and supportive and now that these groups have gottent some more money they have become selfish and moree polarised
2149	1	misogyny and classism has existed in nearly every human culture i dont believe they define indian culture anymore than they define any other culture in history  i do believe that any culture has the potential grow beyond those regressive traits
2150	1	huh no her last name isnt khan
2151	1	the physical and mental are connected puberty is also linked to braindevelopment its said boys brains are not fully developed until ca 25 years of age but of course after 18 most changes and developments are very minor

2153	1	not sure how your comment is relevant to anything i said but ill bite theres certainly overlap of honor killings and extremism not only with pakistan but india nepal bangladesh and srilanka to some extent maybe you werent able to keep up but the discussion is about ills of uk pakistanis vs pakistanis elsewhere like uscanada i spoke about how its difficult to let go of cultural practices for some in uk because the entire community migrated and brought all the machinery that allows a community to ensure conformity compared to individuals migrating to us and canada who arent surrouded by others from the same back ground and culture also i gather youre an ex muslim claiming to be pakistani but you love to start bash pakistanis and muslims every chance you get take my advice and keep that over at exmuslim sub no reason to unnecessarily agitate this subreddit
2154	1	because you are literally on meta canada reddit bro it is like the canadian equivalent of the donald subreddit  it is hard to take anyone serious from those subs when all they do is spew their vitrioli agree india is more religiously diverse but culturally  i beg to differ there is a reason pakistan is still the most poorly understood super power in the world there are so many factors at work at the nation that not even the local know what exactly is going on there is literally a separatist movement going on in balochistan because of how different their culture is  from the dominant punjabi culture  you speak in generalizations without knowing the nuances of the most nebulous country in the world
2155	1	80k gbp is on the equilant purchase power of 70k in the us everything is ridiculously expensive in the uk

2159	1	gt and your point i didnt even mention honour killingsuhh you read the point yet you cant figure out what the point is come on man how old are you we arent having a complex discussion here i also didnt say you mentioned honor killings i mentioned them due to their degeneracy in uk desi both pakistani and indians as well as back home in india and pakistan gt that is true yet as i mentioned that is also a problem with other pakistani groups as well you cant blame it all on mirpuri culturei didnt blame it on mirpuri culture maybe youre reading with such a strong bias that youre creating narratives in your head and then imposing those narratives on what you read kinda weird gt yeah maybe if pakistani culture and islam didnt go around persecuting exmuslims and being generally shitty maybe i would have something more to be proud of but it is not like nationalists like you would understand thatdidnt ask you to be proud of anything i dont have that expectation from you i simply told you to not shove your rhetoric where it isnt relevant
2160	1	my mom has long since switched from rice both white and brown to quinoa
2161	1	im not crazy about the group being called subtle curry traits  it sounds like an awful stereotype
2162	1	gtsays she is got no work going for her see this is what gets to me the most she has probably accumulated enough wealth for herself and two generations of progeny to live a normal middle class life without working ever why does she even care about doing movies anymore like if i was ever an actor id prolly do 23 successful movies and then spend the rest of my life dedicated to my research and my roof gardenalso nick jonas prolly is gay he is admitted to having sex with men before
2163	1	gtfob is a very racist termhow is it racist i thought it was just used to refer to immigrants in general ive only been on reddit for a little over a month and saw people use the term a lot so i followed suit i didnt intend to offend anyone

2168	1	also if you are able to start local ask your family about things youve wanted to know that is the best place to start
2169	1	that is just wrong my man
2170	1	i thought it was hit or miss depending on the instructor it used to be a bunch of showy stuff for the parents a while back but i think the new national changes were made to really teach kids how to fight and defend themselves with regular sparring sessions using weapons etcfrom what i can tell its still a lot more self defense oriented than anything else
2171	1	we should take lessons in religious tolerance from pakistan s
2172	1	it is always cool meeting another agnostic raised as muslim  i can relate talking to my parents and orthodox views would be pretty draining
2173	1	the problem is when sikhs do stand up and protest for their rights and the injustice that happened they get labeled as terrorists or khalistan sympathizers by the indian media
2174	1	apple music affordable good selection of western and desi stuff both classical and newer stuff and very well curated playlists
2175	1	i agree dont know why people are down voting thisconsidering it is lower population britain has enough excellent universities like oxbridge lse imperial which are as good as hypsmit harvard yale princeton stanford better than canada and australia by a long shothealthcare is free for citizensand eea and unlike the us and britain doesnt charge any tax on income earned by brits abroad eitherbut british citizenship is probably harder to obtain for noneea as compared to the usalthough americans on the other hand seem generally less racist more accepting and friendly
2176	1	gt ill say for canada it had much shorter wait times to get the passport very true  i think that naturalisation takes less time in canada and immigration is a lot easier than both us and the uk north american accents are certainly easier to understand than british onesmulticultural london english is especially hard to understand and sounds like jamaican mixed with nigerian and a little bit of cockneyhttpsyoutubenzdli9cgto
2177	1	malik is a pretty common hindu surname in india not really middle eastern
2178	1	edit turns out the quote i thought was real was actually more or less an urban legend winston churchill didnt literally doodle the border of jordan one morning

2182	1	maybe im making it wrong but i bought one of those metal coffee filters used to make it and it just doesnt taste that good it also takes a really long time to make so i gave up on it
2183	1	i mean even on the askmen subreddit the majority of users were college age and virgin according to a survey i guess spending hours a day on this website is related to social awkwardness
2184	1	i thought this was the latest if you could find the link can you share
2185	1	just fyi the guy you are replying to is not the best authority of muslims and if he like sajid then he isnt the smartest person to tell you what a zprogressive is
2186	1	arabhttpsenmwikipediaorgwikimalik_nameas i said above hindus also have it as a last name i just dont know the sub continental origin of it and there is no historical hindu figure with that name pre islam like say vishnu sharma who wrote the panchtantra do you know perhaps it has a origin language in india

2194	1	couldnt agree more problem is with us humans our needs and our desires our disposition to find the smallest of differences among our own and label them as the other may often come out using religion as the driver but remove religion and well just find another medium to label each other as the other
2195	1	the part about de jure segration  foreigninternationals though was under the paragraph initial perceptions which was much earlier

2199	1	who the fuck was talking about dna im not trying to conflate dna with ethnicity nor culture that is some insane nazi shit but also what you have to say is incredibly incorrectwe were talking language and ethnicity neither of which have anything to do with dna dipshit pashto did not develop alongside desi languages all desi languages share more in common with each other than they do with pashtofeel like i gotta yell here otherwise youre going to start giving me race science nonsense toopashto developed alongside persian dialects its from iran no indian language shares common ancestry with it like any other indian language punjabi and telugu have more in common with each other than either does with pashto
2200	1	yeah youre completely right they always try to convince themselves that we are an extreme exception even many desi girls do this which is retarded on the brownbadnboujee instagram page whenever a goodlooking desi dude is posted many of the comments suggest indian dudes like that are super rare its retarded  im on the darker side in terms of skin color but i dont look stereotypical many people think im mixed or latino so i do pretty well with girls but a decent ammount of them lose interest when they find out im indian so its mostly stereotypes thats the issue the incel issue exists in all communitiesraces although i think we see more of it in desi communities online due to the fact that there is an extreme ammount of hatred towards desi dudes online in public spaces
2201	1	gtthe bjp cm seems to be grasping at straws to paint pakistanis as disingenuous after they opened the kartarpur corridor in good faithout of curiousity how are you forming these opinion living in the uswest without living day to day life in the area of conflict isnt it easy to get your opinions manipulated by news media that you consume
2202	1	racial sensitivity is really gay and bad for society
2203	1	they dont think theyre racist but they completely cut me off from my culture language and community and subconsciously presume their way white american of doing things is best i got a lot of pushback from them when i wanted to connect with my culture they also never saw exposing me to my culture and having me involved in my community as a priority theyre also jehovahs witnesses so we never associated with people outside their religious community  and there were no punjabi jehovahs witnesses in the area so i was out of luck because were the only right religion and we need to stay separate and so you cant associate with your community there was also some saviour complex involved but if you ask my adoptive parents about it theyll deny it
2204	1	the least you could do is give him a proper reply otherwise you end up looking like a baiter
2205	1	because when presented with proof you look the other way you harp about being progressive while just focusing on indians because you offer no solutions just criticism because you ignore actual points and derail the convo

2217	1	yeah almost all syllables in dravidian languages are like this the exceptions are the nasal syllables in the abugidas like p rather than papipupepoetc which is what leads to the appan in the name a  p  pa  n this style of segmental writing leads to the mostlyalternating consonantvowel patternsit is a nice property to have because it makes words reasonably easy to pronounce in theory if you know how to sound it out phonetically unfortunately tamil is a little interesting where sometimes a local dialect is pronunciation doesnt exactly match the written form in my experience though the prestige dialect used by reporters etc matches the expected phonetic pronunciation quite closely
2218	1	gt they would have a 5k upvote laugh about itso much for them not caring eh lol you just shot your own argument in the foot and you dont even realize it but please by all means go ahead then i can post the responses of those racist turds on this sub

2221	1	jfc abcds should know and care about their motherland and not just what white society tells them they should assimilate to look at uneducated white americans and how they have lost all of their european culture and just have trashy american culture now it is literally killing them look at the opiod crisis and white declining life expectancy desis should not follow that pattern of generations losing their culture

2228	1	you need to go study history again because what youre saying is simply not true theres little evidence of colorism existing before british rule it was only in the colonial era that sign boards began to emerge prohibiting black indians from entering restaurants and various other public spaces this shaped the common mans association of white colored skin with the ruling class with power with desirability and also with beauty unknowingly it has become a practice of attaching greater societal superiority and power to the fairer skin males and females which in turn dictates and shapes the desire for a westernized concept of beauty with lighter skineven after so many years of independence i am pretty fair myself because my mom is half white but i dont let this lightskin privilege come in the way of my understanding of social issues its fine if you tan or someone else bleaches their skin and i dont honestly give two shits about it what i care about is the health issues stemming from this practice and also a plethora of social issues
2229	1	im actually born and raised in india but ok
2230	1	i hate trump as much as the next guy but whenever he does something good for the community i clap it is insane to be literally against everything he does especially if it is positive to you
2231	1	even muslims and other religious groups in india have a caste system if you are ashrafsayyidyou are definitely top of the game if you come from a a family of engineers you are not marrying into a muslim family who comes from a rickshaw family in hyderabad you have prominent muslim families and they frequently marry with each other and not with low caste muslims hell some muslims brag descent from being converted brahmins instead of dalitssame thing with sikhs with the whole jatt thing and christians with syrian catholics vs latin rite pretty much no one wants to be associated with dalits

2235	1	gt  punjabi and telugu have more in common with each other than either does with pashtoyoure 100 wrong there punjabi and most other north indian languages are part of the indoiranian branch of the larger indoeuropean language family the indoiranian languages include pashto farsi dari and kurdish and most north indian languages have also been heavily influenced by persian telegu is a dravidian language not indoeuropean in other words  punjabi and pashto are cousins but telegu is not related to either to make it even more mindblowing punjabi and other north indian languages and iranian languages are distant cousins with english german russian spanish and most other european languages listen how to count to 10 in punjabihindigujarati and then listen how to do the same in farsi it is almost identical even armenian indoeuropean but not indoiranian is pretty close listen to the numbers in telegu and youll realize how wrong you arein india indoiranian languages and dravidian languages have borrowed words from each other they remain 2 distinct language families
2236	1	indians and maybe desis in general are still very materialistic and like to show off their wealth im sure if that mentality changes the way many of them view poor people might too

2249	1	it is mostly because of internal self hate issues and not because a desi dude truly prefers them
2250	1	nope only after an indian
2251	1	gt uttam sandhadhi aka master race theories are also mainstream parents are to have sex under full moon and eat a shit ton of herbs to birth the veda defined brahman child note the second sentence has nothing to do with the assertion that master race theories are mainstream basically lie and distract in action
2252	1	gt nah hoejabi is a term for a reasonyup but youve misunderstood what ive stated im not saying muslims girls arent promiscuous at all im only saying what i have seen and that they are less promiscuous than non muslim south asian counterpartsgt theyre just screwing where no one can seeas opposed to non muslims south asian girls who screw in public parks lol
2253	1	no but replacing last names with the mom or dads first name seems to have worked in tamil nadu
2254	1	gt i already said the neoliberal was the wrong label in another commenti dont have the inclination to go hunting up comments that you may or may not have made to other people i am going to respond to comments made to me which show up in my inbox i dont know why you think that i am obligated to look through your comment history just on the off chance that you may have walked back that comment with someone elsegtrussia is not a paradigm of human rights and neither is assad just because they are fighting isisno dumbass nobody is saying that they are angels but the fact remains that they are fighting isis you ever hear of that old saying about the enemy of my enemygtrussia isnt fighting terrorists they are maintaining power for a despot who let these terrorists out of jail and uses chemical weapons on civilianswelcome to the world it is a fucked up place and yes some days the dragon wins bottom line is what exactly is your solution to the problem you want to start yet another regime change misadventure because that worked out so well the last time rightfifteen years ago it was saddam now it is assad same poison in a different bottle some idiots never learn
2255	1	gt obviously theyre just playing scrabble and reading the bible syou joke but this is what my college roommate did people like this do exist
2256	1	doesnt look like you understand what indentured servitude is youre assuming coming into the us entitles you to permanent residency it doesnt and it is not secret when applying for visas every h1b and l1 coming into the us knows exactly that the permanent residency situation is yet they choose to come calling america is immigration system indentured servitude is disingenuous and frankly a lie there is a well established path to permanent residency which in my opinion is fair for all people of all countries just because indians send the most h1bs and have the highest backlog doesnt mean the system is unfair to indians think about how unfair it would be to all immigrants of other countries who wouldnt be able to get pr because indians have flocked and cornered an open immigration system
2257	1	you ever even been to puerto rico i live there majority of puerto ricans are white
2258	1	whatever it maybe it might be easier to acknowledge the inherent bias in the sub which favors indian origin abcdesis and thus by association sympathies towards indian govt policies and those favoring hindus
2259	1	ah ok your case is different then gt i dont know why you think muslims marrying converts is somehow an agenda to help the wider muslim community honestly this is a really bad conspiracy that is spread out and it genuinely hurts couples who are in lovei dont know how familiar you are with the issues in india but there is a stereotype that muslims convert anyone they marry if your wife converted to marry you then you would be reinforcing that stereotype muslims marrying converts is different from muslims converting people they marry i was talking about the latter while your case seems to be the former the latter practice does hurt future couples who are in love by reinforcing the stereotype
2260	1	because the congress is an organization run on nepotism and headed by a retard
2261	1	the problem is most people in india dont respect abcds cause they dont see us as true indians we are foreigners and outsiders to them i spent more than 5 years over there and it was pretty much the feeling i got from folks who werent my immediate family

2265	1	the reason why arabs and persians are today considered white is because they lobbied in the past to have that label despite the different cultures immigrants of the past were white and had an easier time integrating into past  american society the paradigm shift today is the fact that immigrants to the us is an increasing majority of nonwhite people
2266	1	people eat biryani with roti wat
2267	1	all of these things hurt desis except liberalized immigration and giving h1b1 spouses work permits  by the way your white liberal friends arent looking over your shoulder right now you dont have to impress them
2268	1	i can see that it is better to talk about it than just screaming about it but at least india is changing even if baby steps legalizing gay marriage is cool and all but i hope the next changes come later rather than never at all the older and recessive problems will always be there as long as the younger generation can be more aware and educated and not repeat the mistakes of the pervious generations it can only get better from here on out
2269	1	dude thanks i think lmao
2270	1	can guarantee it would be higher than the white divorce rate lmfao
2271	1	pretty much hwever rwandan twitter isnt making a fuss even though they have much more of a right than indiansthese are the same people who say apu isnt that bad personally i think it is an insult to apu lol imagine being a hard working immigrant who supports a huge family and some stupid newspaper compares you to a guy who oversaw a religious pogrom
2272	1	yeah indian culture was super cool in the 60s70s and briefly cool again i think in 90s britain brimful of asha
2273	1	we indians are far better educated and affluent than those other groups or any ethnic group in the us for that matter the side effect of discriminatory immigration  i do not think we punch our weight when it comes to politics though

2281	1	that is a good point and something i failed to acknowledge  i keep thinking of the selfhating south asian and forget about how little regard many western media outlets have towards south asia
2282	1	yep me at 24 people will probably tell me im still really young and that i still have plenty of time but ive never been in a relationship before and at this stage i think it is just better for me to accept ill be single forever if things work out differently that is great but i have to be comfortable with the possibility that it wont
2283	1	salaam i speak dari fluently and tbh i cant understand iranians very well lol i def think the way iranians speak farsi is diff from afghans i have to really listen to you guys speak for me to understand lmao so i guess its the accent thats different

2285	1	holy fucking shit thank you so much i tried shazaming it a billion times when i first heard it but it never worked thank you so much you are my hero
2286	1	i was gonna say that
2287	1	i get it for a few of us it isnt a binary thing in real life wouldve been easier if we _looked and felt_ completely indian or completely americanbut use the the indian part of you to be resilient that is ingrained in us
2288	1	that is one way to put it hah
2289	1	ah so you totally know the struggle i am curious though did fiji indians retain hindi andor bhojpuri as their main language
2290	1	i agree i also think it is kinda ironic since all that stuff is still seen in desi movies i dont see mobs of people protesting movies for these things it is only irl that it seems to matter probably for gossip material imo
2291	1	first half is okay second half is utter garbage the acting is great but the story is pretty bad i would not recommend seeing it in theaters
2292	1	ahahahahaha is he really gawd damn i was getting california hippy hindu vibes ampx200bid definitely keep posting updates here it seems like a great idea for sure
2293	1	i would much rather be a brown guy than a black guy in today is america just saying
2294	1	lets not forget seema verma
2295	1	debt we owe them we do maybe if they only took spots from whites who have familial links to owning slaves but what is happening now is that aa takes spots from smart asians and keeps mediocre white kids in
2296	1	im not talking to you anymore if you dont know what the norm is for desis then this discussion is pointless to trivialise abuse as some kid going through a teen phase is quite frankly disgusting and i suggest you do go and visit that subreddit and other forums and read the accounts of people who are in very difficult circumstances before making stupid uninformed comments
2297	1	this reminds me of the south park episode where all the atheists groups in the future are still fighting over the answer to the great question
2298	1	slut shaming is whackas long as everyone is being respectful to themselves and othersgo get those cheeks
2299	1	its a thing aussie indians have been calling themselves for ages hence the namei hate it too  why do they feel the need to tie themselves closely with a negative stereotype
2300	1	that is why i strictly eat brown rice f white food
2301	1	sometimes two people just like each other you know even hasan minaj married a hindu despite being muslim didnt he why is that sort of outmarriage more acceptable if a tamilian and a gujju get married how is that different its all just a matter of degreeif youre dating among a population of people who are english speaking and open to alternative careers or lifestyles like the entertainment industry your social circles start to get really white really fast
2302	1	abcds think they are different because their families got to the us one generation before the fobs did
2303	1	i like his energy but he reminds me of a president of the student union at a super liberal college yelling at me for offending vegans with my lifestyle
2304	1	lmao yeah the north dallas burbs are filled to the brim with brown people
2305	1	62 and 210lbs so nah famtheres tall and wide desis too its not just a european thing
2306	1	true but there were at least a 100 or so pics a lot of attractive people do seem to complain too theres still a lot of  im getting a bunch of matches but xyz posts
2307	1	we have had neoliberal policies for the last 50 years bro it is democrats and republicans are both neoliberals and they are the ones who have caused the problems this country is facing
2308	1	thats your opinion all i will say is that if he is better on the defensive end than both of them and he keeps beating them then that is a big point in favour of him being better he has outplayed them in ways no other player does id be happy to post highlights for him giannis and ad have a combined 1 playoff series win they are not in the same conversation yet they are young upstarts whereas kawhi is already hall of fame levels with his championship and defensive player of the years giannis cant shoot like kawhi and ad cant handle the ball like him either and that is why they will fail to have his impact even if they do get playoff success i legit think he is better than lebron and kd too i have seen him beat them enough that i would take him over them
2309	1	he actually looks more indian than tatiana
2310	1	fuck is rhcp vintage and shit now
2311	1	the indian restaurant which i patronize has got 3040 repeat customers who order butter chicken almost like clockwork every week for the past year most of them can never cook indian food so they are what you called captive customers most indians with the exception of few peeps like me can cook
2312	1	youre still factually wrong though that deeply ingrained racism you speak of doesnt exist people who live today in the us dont have deeper racism towards blacks or native americans compared to indians just because of the history of the country they grow up and learn history and since the schools are liberal they are taught to feel white guilt towards blacks and native americans however brits still glorify churchill and the west still defames india whenever they can so people today have grown up with a sympathetic image towards blacks and a hateful one towards indians its fact and if you cant see it you really need to get yourself checked
2313	1	i do intend to speak up next time with my tip and future patronage plenty of other decent choices where i am oh and i hope this venting is seen by others and taken into account by owners so i wouldnt be so confident that it doesnt change anything
2314	1	its truly like a different country i graduated hs a few years back and my high school was 96 asian that year according to school data
2315	1	gt i think it is high time all the sikhs and muslims make a separate subbe the change that you wish to see in the world mahatma gandhi
2316	1	gtwhere indian is think were western and westerners think were indian that must be really irritating that feeling you cant even express to anyone
2317	1	you cant expect to keep languages or traditions but doesnt mean that you dont try all my mixed friends who did not get any guidance on exposure to their culture are the true abcds i now they all feel this void and talk about it frequently we are wired to belong to something or somewhere and thats not something that can be undone i know a lot people who say they dont care but a few years later or when they had kids it suddenly does
2318	1	i agree with this have the fights early set lower expectations and it is only uphill from there
2319	1	lmao what is with this sub and huge nationalist boners for a country they dont even live in
2320	1	that is so true  shitty parents are all around the world
2321	1	hell i wish my boss could do that
2322	1	yeah one tv show cant tell the stories of all desis and we shouldnt expect that nor should we try to represent all desis with one tv show not sure why this is getting downvoted im saying we should have more south asian stories not less or none at all
2323	1	gt gujaratis punjabis and other northwest desis are indoaryans yes white or not i cannot say for whiteness is a malleable conceptgt gt sinhalese bangladeshis and bihari dalits are also indoaryan gt balochis are some of the few desis the us classifies as caucasian as they are an iranic peopleso is malala yousufzai and her fatherhttpspbstwimgcomprofile_images947556360782254082tti3bea_400x400jpg
2324	1	well yeah pakistani americans on average are much wealthier than pak brits

2326	1	fucking kellog man
2327	1	his birth certificate will be an entire book
2328	1	youre probably the racist

2330	1	thats the plan but im not sure if ill even get into thosei live in ga and the fact that i fucked up in getting hope is killing me
2331	1	halloween is more of a fancy dress occasion for adultsof course it is starting out as a bandasouth bombay thing but i can see the appeal it is becoming really hard to have fun during indian festivals  cant do holi because water conservation cant do crackers because pollution cant eat sweets because diabetes and carbs these are legitimate concerns but halloween is a great excuse for young adults to party and have fun without worrying about destroying the environment

2333	1	well you took the worst possible message from this the point of stories like this is to learn from the past understand where people come from and not blame current british people who werent even born yet for the sins of their great grand fathers
2334	1	python is easy programming language to start with edit not sure why the downvote but it is easy language to start with check it out on youtube i dont know c c or java or whatever crazy language i dont make websites or apps i just work with database and data analysisjust python and sql pretty easy
2335	1	damn that is on point
2336	1	she has alot to gain by marrying a white hollywood celebrity though i doubt there are many celebrities in the west with equivalent starpower to priyankas in india who would be willing to marry her  especially not that fast she is getting old so she needed to find someone fast imo to save her career for a little longer
2337	1	this is subjective bollywood is popular in the middle east
2338	1	good connection why not but first trt to determine which person would actually have to move countries in the long term
2339	1	ive wondered do jaats feel a kinship with jatts
2340	1	there is a difference though between wanting your partner to do more of their share of the housework or be more responsible with money or whatever else and believing strongly enough that your background your religion your culture and here i mean a generic your not pointing to anyone in particular is so superior to the other person is that they have to basically make a public declaration that they have rejected that culture smacks of cultural imperialism to me
2341	1	you mean going out begging for candy wearing a mask to hide your shame si think that quote was from fresh off the boat but it is pretty apt for desi attitudes as well
2342	1	what are these weird interests and yeah i feel the same way sometimes as well  i seem to have interests that many of my desi  friends dont
2343	1	gt im always paranoid the guy ive set my sights on is only stringing me along and lowkey talking to other girlsisnt this completely reasonable if youre only just ever in the casual dating phase
2344	1	and honestly there is no issue if parents do not choose to  pass it down big deal there are much more priorities nowadays that you have to worry about when raising kids so and i are the same if we were to have kids but will definitely encourage it if they do wish to learn later on but they definitely will be surrounded by the culture since so lives in an area with a lot of desisas for learning as an adult it does not have to be hard if once you cram down how the structure goes but it depends on the the language too spanish is easy def not arabic plus it has been said several times that learning a language as an adult is very good for you since it heavily exercises your brain and keep it sharp dramatically the chances of getting alzheimer is or dementia
2345	1	gt so i get that i wouldnt dare bash anyone for wanting to build a statusstatus is ok if you want to build up for yourself and please yourself but a lot of folks in the desi community go the extreme lengths where they start competing with each other compare each other creating a rat race producing toxic relationships and crushing others who are not up to par that is not ok the desi society needs to get rid of that
2346	1	those comments may have been written by a troll army from st petersburg
2347	1	you can do both if you have friends who you like and get along with then of course color should not matter but when it comes to political issues voting and what brands you support who you donate money to etc in such cases you should prioritize your own triberace ie desis
2348	1	nope but i understand thats what you want to believe you could not be more wrong though
2349	1	yeah id rather we have more of an atlanta type of show that depicts a handful of different south asian walks of life convenience store clerks taxi drivers and motel owners not excepted theyre just as much part of the fabric of this transplant culture as the software engineers cardiologists and litigation attorneys everyone immediately thinks ofas a south asian writer who would love to write this pilot i truly only feel like 110th of the picture and id want to work with others who can fill in the other parts properly
2350	1	religious reasons most likely there were a lot sri lankans in dance when i was growing up probably from the hindu tamil connection
2351	1	nice thanks for passing that long appreciate it
2352	1	i do the same thing minus the tea masala at the end
2353	1	ok maybe i just misread it but your reply seems a little harsh considering i wasnt even endorsing opensubtitlesorghttpsopensubtitlesorg i was talking about a plugin that makes it really easy to add subtitles for a lot of videos that happens to use itim sure subscene may be better but i couldnt find a similar plugin for it so there doesnt seem to be an easy way to autofind subscene subtitles to vlc until someone writes one
2354	1	thanks for understanding i appreciate the words of wisdom i will try to be better as well
2355	1	i dont understand the arguement you are saying that their extremist views are good since they get support of 90 of people
2356	1	i mean you should ask your friends if you want a specific answer christmas is also a cultural event in many parts of the world and eid isnt as integral a part of us or european culturelet me ask you  why are you so surprised are you upset about it
2357	1	gt how do i stop myself from judging them for not having succeeded by indian american standardslmao is this really an actual thought that crosses through peoples minds i guess the easiest way is to stop trying to compare yourself to them
2358	1	these are mirchein this masala there is more than salt in food
2359	1	i date black girls exclusively
2360	1	that is really interesting because ive had the opposite experience when i spent christmas in india two years ago we went to christmas eve mass and then partied the rest of the night drinking and dancing the party didnt end until 6am but then again this area had a lot of catholic indians
2361	1	id get my name legally changed
2362	1	just like russiaonly there is no russian movies in this list and no one ever calls russians asian clearly the common understanding of asian has a bit more to it than simply being technically in the continent of asia i say this with an asterisk because it has no real distinction or physical reason for it to even be considered a distinct continent from europe our entire understanding of the 7 continents is made up shit that is a result of europeans deciding it to be that way ages ago weve only kept believing it to be fact because that is how it is always been which is a pretty shit reason for picking what way of chopping up and categorizing the world were going to all accept
2363	1	no problem  usually filter coffee is on the darkerdeeper side in terms of colour so try to adjust your milk according to thatboil just the milk and have the decoction ready in a cupglass the decoction usually is room temperature or cool because you just take it from the bottom compartment of the percolator add the boiled milk into the glass with the decoction dont forget the whole frothing process tho dont mix decoction and milk with a spoon do the whole transferring maneuver
2364	1	my mum says she had jain friends when she was younger and that when they went to her house they wouldnt even drink water from her tap because theyre meat eaters is this typical behaviour for jains
2365	1	your mom sounds courageous it is so hard to leave an abuser for so many reasons including financial security she must be tough as nails that is so warped that you were around all that food and going hungry was this in the us the lack of a social safety net in the richest country in the world is beyond my comprehension my family struggled financially too and it has absolutely impacted by politicseconomic views as well the career i chose  reflects this tooi grew up in canada so while there was some stigma for not being middle class it is not like what i see now that i live in the us the desi community that ive encountered is quite affluent and always looking for ways to augment and increase their wealth i absolutely can see how someone poorer would be shunnedi remember one woman complaining about the building of rental apartments in the town we lived in and saying it would bring undesirable people the whole time i was thinking youre actually the undesirable person in this scenario

2379	1	the entire tech industry has this issue you choose another job and youll find similar happenings  im pointing the blame at the people who run these companies not at the immigrants they will come here to do what is best in their interests this is why we are supposed to have a government that evens things out with policies so companies play fair across the board  we know unchecked caplitalism doesnt work it turns into a monopolyoligopoly wages dip and the freemarket dies that is the end state of a lot of industries

2384	1	i would say girls mature faster because theyre forced to by society i dont think its innate theres still plenty of people having kids in their 30s in fact i think more and more people are pushing 30 to have their first kid these days the fathers age may play a big role in how healthy the kid turns out too this is a research field thats gaining a lot of traction right now

2390	1	if your aunt is kids wanted to learn  they still can you know instead of moping take initiative and do something especially with technology and resources nowadays i dont understand why people fail to realize that they too can pick up a book or take courses to learn immerse themselves and just the blame the parents for not teaching them if parents dont pass it down which is not a crime it does  not mean it can never be learned a lot of people even americans learn languages fluently despite having no exposure  to it before it can be done just think outside the box and seriously stop with the insecurities
2391	1	the guy notorious for personal attacks finds personal attacks problematic

2400	1	shitty parenting and culturalreligious customs will do that to you
2401	1	gt am i correct that socialization is sort of a nuanced skill like any other there are many unsaid rules when you converse and interact with people and these rules cant be taught theyre almost unconscious and if youre unaware of these rules of socialization because of your lack of experience youre seen as weirdyes it is a skill it is not innate  social anxiety definitely is linked with errorrelated negativity in children httpswwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticleabspiis0890856717317732  makes sense that if you literally dont know how to navigate social reactions and youre deeply afraid of making errors you end up with social anxiety
2402	1	came here to say this by far most parents i knew came around but thats always hard when its your parents and your life without knowing your familys dynamics my generic advice would be for your sister to find a way to blow off her steam and not engage in acrimonious fights with your parents that will lead to them guilt tripping her even if they dont mean to be manipulative she needs to stick to her guns and keep it short clear and consistently on message as with anything its more effective to frame conversions with the focus on how she feels by their actions rather than accusing them of doing bad things even though it may be true eg  i understand your fearsworries etc but i need you to know that im very hurt by the way you are treating me  i feel like you arent respecting me as an adult i will always love you and family means a lot to me i know you know that which is why this hurts me so much etc

2411	1	lmao your insecurity speaks volumes pathetichalf your songs are stolen from pakistanis the other half from koreans and then you claim yall are greati never said that pakistan is a bastion of peace but on the other hand i actually know and believe that it is improving while india regresses so much you all have to song the national anthem at a cinema with half naked women insecure insecure and insecure so insecure you held a grudge for half a month seething that i said something against india where you most likely dont even livenice job projecting your delusional fanradies about your sickular government have you talked to the beef lynch mob victims or the childrenteenagers because they are muslim because your cm promites that shit
2412	1	because it translates to we need more bootlickers if you read op is post objectively the higher quality of life ie good health that he repeatedly commends the west for did not develop in a vacuum nothing annoys me more than when people act like the colonial era never happened and the west became what it is today through the magic of high morals and democracy
2413	1	yes you lose
2414	1	im definitely saving this comment
2415	1	from what i got it looks like some youtuber and a indian company are in a battle to see who can get the most subscribers why people are so emotionally invested in this i have no idea
2416	1	gandhis faults are still his faults but using kavanaugh to justify every example of prior statements being used to condemn someone for his entire life is a pretty bad percent and isnt made in good faith for example if every comment you made when you were younger was held against you it would be wrong of me to invoke kavanaugh every time you protestedpeople are allowed to grow as humans and its irresponsible to mention racism and gandhi without the context of the time period of his life we are talking about
2417	1	i know what you mean man so thank for the positive vibes really appreciate itlike most things in life you need a healthy balance guess thatll be my 2019 resolution to have a healthy balance wish you luck for 2019 too

2421	1	it was like that for them too men never hung out with girls or talked to women as friends the only time theyd go meet a girl is if they wanted to marry them it was annoying as when i did meet a few women that i was starting to be friends with when i was in college i was constantly berated because my dad would say i was running around with womendefinitely you can pick them up it was and still is a huge it for me datingwise but they can be picked up just have to keep practicing and learning how to boost that up and get skills

2427	1	everything is fine because they target and harass everyone
2428	1	i do remember some controversy around that i think when 3 idiots was releasedof course such incidents do bring out racist loudmouths and there is no excuse for thatbut at the same time they challenge some assumptions platform designers might have made is top 250 a list of the best movies around the entire world or is it a list of the best english movies do we also include korean japanese or russian movies but we dont have much user content votesratingsreviewstraffic for those how do we handle indian movies which tend to have varying levels of english content how do we handle this in the context of western studios making content targeted towards western audiences but with an increasing amount of foreign language content like narcos how do we make all these decisions in a neutral politically correct mannerit might seem racist but in my admittedly very sympathetic view it is just people taking some time to readjust to new realities with different assumptions
2429	1	theyre pakistani and indian rthe_donald
2430	1	objectively speaking there are more good things than bad things about our background the only truly bad thing is that western people try to portray us in a way so that we will feel ashamed of it
2431	1	i thought the same until i googled it and its pretty legit theres also some weird ass people out there who make biryani tacos with rotis or flatten it out for a roti quesadilla its blasphemous

2452	1	i gotta ask what do you think the status is for muslims in india do you think that they are a collective of hapless innocents who wouldnt hurt a fly persecuted and wronged at every turn cowering in misery and fear under the iron boot of the hindu meanieshere is a reality checkhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrdvlgn5u5fm sorry to burst your bubblethat guy is an mla by the way the indian equivalent of a congressman

2464	1	ha yeah this is definitely a thing my dad has a friend whose last name is tendolkar so my dad asked him how come most people spell it tendulkar like the cricketer dude went off on a tangent about how his last name is the better one
2465	1	gtinteresting my mum is a christian malayali from australia btw i am guessing youre from america  gt  gti used to think i felt a kinship towards anyone of a south asian background because i didnt really know any outside of my own family and my family was culturally whitewashed as some may say  gt  gti definately feel some kinship towards indians who grew up not super culturally indian but i feel a huge disconnect towards othersampx200byep that is cool your mom is a second generation my family and friend circle too we have half malayalees future niecesnephews i may have in the future will be half mallu  p also dont used whitewashed because you are degrading yourself in how you are a person or how your family life is there is nothing wrong with it   from 3rd generation and onwards regardless if you marry within the same community or not  the kids will be more whitewashed or less connection to india or whatever country than second generation it is a natural phenomena and isnt really a bad thing and you cant expect culture to be preserved the same way many generations down the line however as always it is encouraged to know about your family background ampx200bare the people you interact with immigrants or second generation growing up here with immigrants who are very traditional and conservative i can see that unless they are city folks however with most second generation they tend to be more australian american or whatever than indian since they are growing up or educated abroad  i dont think it is that hard to connect with them
2466	1	i do know about islam  i didnt say my entire definition was that he didnt practice i said it was progressive that he allowed his wife to keep her religion that is a very progressive move for a muslim i can point to you countless number of times where people who married a muslim spouse were forced to convert to stay as a couple
2467	1	they all look like tabloid newspapers  large fonts simple headlines and just obnoxious design  its the same for all of them including the subs here  but they arent trying to court ivy leaguers  they are courting the same people that buy the tabloids
2468	1	then not sure what youre talking about
2469	1	it is okay a lot of us are quite used to being forgotten or do eventually make it to western countries and actively suppress where we were raised to just kinda fit in we dont really belong anywhere were justhere that is all

2472	1	that is me too replace engineering with another stem career
2473	1	you can say this about any crime
2474	1	thanks for posting that study  something interesting i found on page 731 was thisgtentry to restaurants and educational institutions was prohibited for black indians with entry boards clearly stating indians and dogs not allowed even nehru was denied membership to a famous british clubit sounds to me that the restrictions were for indians across the board not just for dark skinned indians  jawaharlal nehru india is 1st prime minister was of kashmiri pandit ancestry and had comparatively fair skin especially when compared to others in the indian national congress at the time  the fact that he was denied and the fact that the british equally disdained indians of all shades seems to point at the entry restrictions being based on ethnicitynationality rather than skin type
2475	1	gtim not religious and she refuses to touch me or hand me anything shell drop it in my hand instead because my life is impure and you had physical relations with whore that is a whole new level

2477	1	gt yea they always looked down on the poorer folksit is really sad that this is the case international desis at least the ones i know always harp on the fact that were all desis and need to stick together against other races yet have no problem putting down their own for being poor
2478	1	ya i think i saw a video of an indian american aunty who either runs cry or is a senior member i have been to one of their locations in india

2482	1	gt religion is culture and culture is not static religions were developed to meet the needs of its adherents as well as for social control  if through time the needs change religion will inevitably adapttotally agreeby true religion i was hinting at the ultimate truth of life and the unanswerable questions of the universe some religions profess that they know it all and the claim of objective morality is so comforting without having a written and basic list of rules or commandments you could say life would seem too chaotic and would depress the crap out everyone to me simply declaring that you know the ultimate truth isnt enough i need proof not faithindigenous australians are still a very animist and spiritual people many tribes still hold values such as living off the land similar to native americans but if i were to pick a religion right now id pick sikhi from what little i know it seems to be an egalitarian free and progressive religion compared to the others i still need to read more about itwith increasing development and the spread of internet i think religion will be almost entirely replaced i dont know what by but i think it willphew weve really fleshed out a conversation this past week or two havent we i reckon weve squeezed as much as we could out of it and im pleased with the discussion weve had like i said youre not bad for an auntyji fellow desi
2483	1	model minority is just a tool for racists to keep the other minorities down
2484	1	yeah youre right saying something terrible to someone should mean he should be fired and sent back to india and his family should be poor forever
2485	1	it was said in jest as an acknowledgement of cultural differences more than anything elsei mean if this was a regular international sub id have qualified having a maidcook more appropriately but i thought desi people would know it is not a big deal down there that turned out to not be the case and i found that amusing no condescension was intended but im sorry if it came off that way
2486	1	its humour dont like it dont listen to it no need to call someone poor widdle nazi
2487	1	i am not saying it is true about 100 of bangladeshis it is true about 90 bangladeshis for example a  bangladeshi would ask another which district the other is from when meeting someone new and then hed make some assumption about characters simply based on his birthplace
2488	1	yes cause previous generations were known for impeccable etiquette and treatment of all humans woe is the gen z that has lost their way  previous generations started this trend of where those who control the money get to decide what is going on if they dont like a performer theyre under no obligation to keep their performance going as long as they pay the man then i see no problem paying him would actually be an improvement over most older businessman where their etiquette is stiffing the people they hire ask the president he is got plenty of history about that and guess which generation voted the most for himhttpswwwusatodaycomstorycollege20161109howwevotedbyageeducationraceandsexualorientation37424551so before you start crying about newer generations losing etiquette or social norms best to know your stuff httpswwwusatodaycomstorycollege20161109howwevotedbyageeducationraceandsexualorientation37424551

2490	1	gt marry someone within my ethnic and religious backgroundwhy
2491	1	did i say i speak for kashmiri muslims i speak as a kashmiri sunni muslims in the valley are for independence as they are getting radicalized but definitely not the shia muslims in ladakh and jammu  kashmir will never succumb to islamic extremists no matter how much you put paint terrorists as innocents  first thing is as a person of pakistani origin is call out your government for allowing non kashmiris to settle in azad kashmir secondly call out a balochistan referendum to show good faith and that you can walk the walk also maybe call out their closest ally in that they literally put muslims in camps to reeducate them but you wont a hear that from pakistan
2492	1	you sound extremely insecure but im still willing to have a conversation because im not inhumane like you portray yourself to be please go cleanse the closemindedness of your personality or take your lack of emotional awareness elsewhere
2493	1	and
2494	1	i hear this a lot but i have spent a lot of time with recent immigrants who have kids and they are far more strict than i am with my kids they dont let their middle school daughters go to school dances though the boys are allowed at one point all my daughters friends were desi and she had no one to go to the dance with most parents dont allow sleep overs even after ive mad an effort to get to know the parents they exert immense pressure on their kids to achieve both academically and in extra curricular activities i have yet to meet any who would allow their daughters to date or be ok with their kids being gay interestingly many of these adolescents and teens are indeed exploring their sexual identity regardless of these restrictions and without the knowledge of their parents just like my generation did back in the 80si know all of this because my daughter tells me last point these recent immigrants are all educated and upper middle class
2495	1	if previous posts on the topic are any indication thats a source of pride for a lot of people here
2496	1	listen my 14 year old friend what you are refereeing to is a poll that is based in the valley i am not basing it on secretarian lines please show anything besides a reporter is personal view that they support independence less than 1 of jammu wanted independence in that same poll despite muslims being about 8 of the population there you can be honest and fortright and say you dont really care about the religious minorities and you want them to have an islamic state whataboutism doesnt dismiss claims as you have mentioned it has a lot to do because it is mostly pakistanis making claims for independence while ignoring what is happening in their door steps  muslim indians dont say things like that i am in favor of a referendum too but you have to get everyone in that being said an independent kashmir wont even survive because it has no access to the sea and is land locked just like what would happen to kurdistan

2523	1	hindu dharmashastras prohibit the eating of the domesticated pig the wild boarpig is fine to consume however for some reason most people dont do it these days because of cultural inertia
2524	1	gt he started to make movies for the nri audience and the trend for portrayals of abcds changedid say that was arguable  he pushes the narrative that nris are almost entirely wealthy captains of industry living that mittal lifestyle and the crotchfruit of said nris are about some of the most emotionally immature cretins ive ever seen who act as the vampish second love interest against the hypervirtuous desi you know the trope if anything id argue that he made things worse for nris if they were the audience he was targeting the real reason was actually more aligned with the fact that a big chunk of film financiers are wealthy business families that live outside india went to school in dubai with the children of some of them and this was in some weird way a nod to them
2525	1	so into you bring vegetarian as in they want to be veggie too or something else most of my nondesi friends are definitely ambivalent at best about me being vegetarian

2533	1	dj srimix i saw that i was like damn tough competition penn phd and a dj
2534	1	they believe in the out of india theory where they see themselves as the original people of the subcontinent and the progenitor of the indoaryan and consequently the indoeuropean civilizationsthis is antagonist to the more common indoaryan migration theory of the early aryans migrating or invading the region after the demise of the ivc
2535	1	given your history of bigotry against pakistanis i just want to make sure you are referring to these guys and not uk pakistanis in general
2536	1	maybe  just maybe you might not have heard people from these nationalities is either because most people from these nationalities do not post on the internet in the language you speak or too small or too shitty

2544	1	and this was executed under congress authoritarianleader indira gandhi
2545	1	my bad dude youre rightindo canadian just sounds better to me i think it is cause a local punjabi paper my dad reads is called the indo canadian
2546	1	the civil rights act was 1964 the year before and something like 95 of the democrats that opposed it stayed with the democrat party after not to mention democrat jimmy carter swept the racist deep south in 1976 ill be honest im not a fan of racial identity politics i dont feel that because someone is white black or indian means theyre obligated to vote for a certain party core republican values are still the same though ie limited government lower taxes laissezfaire economics and deregulation we can debate the merits of those values of course but race shouldnt play a factor in which party you supportnot a fan of the racists of course but i dont think they represent the platform of the republican party im not a fan of policy that increases the power and authority of the government which means while i may have serious issues with the republican party i wont be voting democrat either
2547	1	kamala harris identifies as black either way what have any of these people done to help indian americans
2548	1	seriously i told my then bf and now husband ummmmmmm this is indian food i made it its not love unless its honest

2551	1	cool what is your ethnicity if you dont mind me asking i cant think of an ethnicity in south asia that speaks dari except the tajiks of afghanistan
2552	1	oh okay it is cause i was thinking of mughal babur and his name means lion guess they are different names then
2553	1	my family is muslim rajput from the greater punjab and i would really be interested in your book any info on when you plan to publish it
2554	1	this is too true nose rings are really bad especially the septum ones i legit have trouble looking at girls faces who have them they just seem unclean
2555	1	eh this isnt really that much of a thing there is some class distinctions based on family and lineage but it is not a huge deal and it is not very delineated nowhere near the hindu caste system anyways gt if you come from a a family of engineers you are not marrying into a muslim family who comes from a rickshaw familythis exists in some form in societies everywhere which may have been your point idk it is not really indicative of a caste system like there is in india though
2556	1	i really recommend anyone whos south asian to watch this on netflix i found the korean immigrants in the show to be super similar in their behavior and the jokes they crack to my own parents
2557	1	exactly
2558	1	you still are going to get targeted by a fringe of leftists who believe you cant be racist towards white people because the system is intended to benefit them and a select few groups which asians constitute of
2559	1	it is all they know  i make sure to expose my white friends to different stufftook one of my best white friends to a dosa place  him and his wife thoroughly enjoyed that
2560	1	because as always it is functionally impossible for a spot on the internet to serve common sense and the middle ground always goes too far one way
2561	1	i made my mom watch dairy is scary and she could only stomach about 30 seconds before giving up dairy she even took soymilk to the mandir for shivaratri
2562	1	anecdotally none of my east asian friends were beat while literally every desi i know was
2563	1	aww does it make you feel appreciated that white man took a liking your culture
2564	1	lmao calling me pussy and a coward from behind a screen thats really cute i literally never said that you needed imperialism i just told people to stop whining about it because it happened so long ago again you have a preconceived notion as to what a desi who hates himself looks like doesnt mean youre right it just means youre biased and have a tendency to stereotype
2565	1	tum hi hoso drop it lowshort skirt mein tum hi ho
2566	1	i dont think he counts same with nicki
2567	1	i do intend to speak up next time with my tip and future patronagewhat a bold passive aggressive move
2568	1	they exist for a reason
2569	1	animation
2570	1	definitely human hahahahahaha ill show myself out
2571	1	gti know so many mixed asians and the ones who have kept their ethnic culture beyond superficial things like food is extremely low i can only name like 2 or three that know their asian languagethis is very true and completely describes how i grew up i am half white and indian but i think that some of us develop an interest in learning about our roots later on i did for example in my early 20s and i am 26 now i have a bunch of cousins and my sister who are also mixed they arent particularly interested in indian culture and pretty much identify with western culturethat being said i think the reverse would happen if we had grown up in asia
2572	1	same lol
2573	1	yeah he said most of the people convicted in recent grooming gangs have been of pakistani descent not that most paedophiles in the uk are its a horribly inaccurate headline surprisingly most of the indians here think its trueyou can go on the uk database  for yourself and see they overwhelmingly have white british nameshttpstheukdatabasecomeven if you search bradford blackburn birmingham etc most of the names are still white
2574	1	exceptthats not what the caste system is for you dont need the caste system to be selective about you who date and marry the caste system has perpetuated discrimination in hindu communities for centuries i can never understand why hindus defend it because even today it only leads to more violence and discrimination i say all of this as someone with a brahmin background
2575	1	i dont think it either i eat meat normally but my dad says that when we are in india to not say that we eat meat especially pork so
2576	1	ive heard my mom say that women age significantly after childbirth so if the guy isnt older shell end up looking like his mother
2577	1	indian men  dads tend to be breadwinners not male role models families do well financially but not socially east asia too true for me i do hope that i dont end up like him but i feel i just might well i dont seem to do the making friends thing well these days shrugs
2578	1	its not only that though its also stereotyping and status at play and middle eastern guys pretty much only have the terrorism and misogyny stereotype which south asians also get in addition to that south asian men are stereotyped as nerdy and effeminate with funny accent
2579	1	100 this apart from a few good indian restaurants most places are just punjabi hacks using tomato paste to cook everything
2580	1	im dying to know how that conversation went did you just casually mentioned your shaved balls and she was like oh god yes finally
2581	1	while the issue of skin colour is complex  from genetic evolutionary and cultural standpoints  it is something weve been able to research much more effectively as molecular genetics and genomics tools have developed one team using genetics and genomic tools to study this question are out of the centre for cellular and molecular biology in hyderabad my own personal tldr which will inevitably be an oversimplification is that fair skin in india comes from the same gene that gives europeans fair skin probably from the same indo european ancestor long long ago as in europe indians in certain regions received a competitive advantage from the gene ie people at higher latitudes who could now make more vitamin d and women for whom this vitamin is especially important however india is caste system seems to play a very large role in skin colour variability with brahmins everywhere having fairer skin for example genetic studies show that indians used to interbreed all the time but a rigid ingroup breeding system castes stopped all that about 2000 years ago so for the past two millenia indians have largely selected mates who were genetically more like themselves now could it just be random chance that people designated brahmins happened to generally have fairer skin and that trait was enhanced due to 2000 years of ingroup breeding absolutely but what happens when a desirable group eg brahmins happen to have a common trait eg fair skin the trait becomes desirable right it is just human nature anyway while there is still a lot to learn on the subject i think we can say that skin colour has been a consideration in india for a very long time this isnt new although im sure marketing has made it a lot worse regardless of how long favouring fair skin has been a thing i think it is time to change that now dont you sourcesfirst a review article on the genetic basis of human skin colour variability for youhttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc5502412and now a sampling what is known about the slc24a5 gene european  south asian fair skin gene in india and other genetic studies relating to south asianshttpstimesofindiaindiatimescomindiaskincolourtiedtocastesystemsaysstudyarticleshow55532665cmshttpsjournosdiarycom20180818casteskincolourindianshttpswwwlivesciencecom38751geneticstudyrevealscastesystemoriginshtml
2582	1	it is just the opposite of what bollywood does where back home people want desis who are as light skinned as possible hollywood wants them to look as exoic and as foreign as possible so they prefer darkskinned onessame shit different asshole
2583	1	someone has to cross the ts and dot the is around here
2584	1	not really tbh for example an american can criticise the aztec invasion and forceful subjugation of tlaxcala nations even though they themselves are the products of invasionit is only hypocritical if they support the latter invasion see also alt right arsewipes that think the native american genocide was all might makes right but scream deus vult whenever istanbul is mentioned
2585	1	gtthe guy is his own worst enemy how he is the second richest actor after jerry seinfeldhe is a fucking business man not an actor no offence
2586	1	deep down you love it
2587	1	canada barely has black people lmao and the ones they do have are largely african immigrants very different from descendants of slaves in americathe canadian desis get away with that shit because they dont grow up around enough black people to check them and simply emulate what they see on tv same with cali desis i think cali isnt even 5 aaindians that grew up in the south or in urban areas dont emulate black culture but are way more respectful of it
2588	1	welcome to the club youre not alone friend many of us struggle with our culturalracialsocial identity and whether or not were indian enough thats the c in abcds
2589	1	ive met a lot of people who have said vanc is beautiful  do need to pay it a visit though im smitten with toronto
2590	1	yes she was born thereher father died when she was young and she was his favorite kid out of the 6 siblingsher entire side of the family is super religious and still thinks that my gf is a whore unless she marries me  mom likes her though because she is really pretty dont corrupt her lmaowe talked about future plans and her side of the family totally expects us to live with mom and dad if we get married they were shocked and appalled to hear that people in the 21st century dont do thatpretty sure she is npd dad enables her to be this way
2591	1	thisss people on here are just loudly tooting their own horn and bragging about how diverse their friends are lol who gives a shit i have both nri and abcd friends and theyre both awesome i dont need to go around bragging how either group is better than each other no wonder we have problems in the community
2592	1	gtsecurity officials openly admit that unarmed civilians trying to enter india illegally are being killed youre sounding like trump defending border policy against mexico except this is infinitely worse
2593	1	honestly i have no clueprobably varies from person to person
2594	1	i think you dont understand my point the invasion of iraq was clearly done on false pretenses by a greedy opportunist cheney and a collection of deluded idealists who truly believed they would change the region that was incompetence not malice russia and iran pumped money into insurgent terrorist groups to continue destabilizing the region russia for arms sales and iran to ensure regional hegemony that was malice on their part the nato countries pouring money into the region was because they saw an opportunity to remove a close ally of russia and also feared for the continued unfettered expansion of isis had they not poured those funds in we would be talking about how the us shouldve done more to prevent the spread of isis had russia and iran not rushed to support assad hed be dead already
2595	1	do mgtows hate black people too i thought they were just against commitment
2596	1	yes japan wanted to invade and conquer india for the same resources only under imperial rule they wouldve purged and pillaged a lot more than the british did  if there was no british army and we were still tribal states it wouldve been easy picking for the japanese
2597	1	love is simply a neurochemical con job
2598	1	they seem to be trying to spark a revivalhttpswwwindiatodayinmagazinenationstory20181203thereturnofterror139374720181123the ones who provide logistics and support for terrorists are as guilty as the ones who do the planning and execution
2599	1	i am sure since in the military you interact with various indians instead of indians of your background you become more liberal
2600	1	but the religion did the deed
2601	1	oh man im also gay not yet out to my parents so for you they know and yet they still want you to marry a girl what do they expect will happen  who is the winner in that scenario
2602	1	nah definitely not that far among indian americans its still pretty taboo
2603	1	gt bring in cheap international talent who are happy to work at lower rates so they can drive down wages for everyoneisnt that how free markets work though and what exactly is a good wage for that labor if the workers from india are able to survive and flourish on those wages and also send money back why cant canadians adjust their lifestyles accordingly gt and exploit them to work longer hours for freeso why not lobby for better labor regulations i dont get why people jump to fearing foreign labor unless you want to close markets and isolate your societynation completely if people want wage protections get your government to regulate the labor costs
2604	1	i sympathize with this
2605	1	i think i should have clarified in this case rich asian programmers are largely responsible for screwing over poor asian taxi drivers there is the irony
2606	1	so true
2607	1	yes
2608	1	poor incel if you care that much about other people is relationship preferences youre beyond pathetic maybe it is because of judgmental assholes like yourself that abcd girls dont want to date youedit i read your post history it is all you not race
2609	1	dont use words you dont know neoliberal policies are what will save this country
2610	1	yeah because conservative definitely cared about a brown person if he was killed by a rightwing nut they would claim the white killer was mentally ill and shouldnt politicize this as usualtheyre just using his death to push their agenda they dont give a fuck about him or any nonwhite
2611	1	gt dont want babies what is the point of marriageto show commitment because you love the other person to have someone make healthcare decisions on your behalf you dont need to be married to have babies they didnt do that in huntergatherer societies back in the day and many people certainly dont do it now millions of people have kids out of wedlock plus we live in a country with a high divorce rate getting married for kids makes no sense today
2612	1	houston desis claim to care about their community but only a very few do i remember one time my leg was broken so i couldnt drive to uh and my dad went to the nearby masjids to find a ride for me nobody would help because they were all making excuses like oh my sons car is full or oh my son is driving with someone else i had to find help outside of the desi community which wasnt a problem for me but it sucked that nobody within my community wanted to help at all
2613	1	actually desis are so diverse im malayalee xtian and before i got married i dated sikh punjabi bengali hindu goan muslim and mallu white  all abds  they were definetly out of my commiunity gene pool the closest was the malluwhite guyit is not that hard to find south asian diversity i didnt even get around to pakistani sri lankan bangladeshi and indo carribean
2614	1	gthow the hell can you be born and brought up in the uk and be so dumb i thought their school system was supposed to be goodthis reminded me of the muslim community in the city i grew up with most people were fairly modern but there were those outliers that were dead set on maintaining their tradition by any means necessary with some patterns of abusers it usually involved isolationprivatehomeschooling only allowing few people into their social circledoing whatever is necessary to exert control all to make sure they would be dependent as long as possible they definitely should have a sense of shame no reasonable person wants to think about babies being hurt and this woman is in deep denial about the repercussions of her actions ampx200b
2615	1	i think this will just give your genetic history
2616	1	bro we all know what he and i are talking about it is not anything racist or antiimmigrant ethnic enclaves of any sort are inherently outoftheordinary with their respective cultural values being amplified enormously no matter what the ethnicity is i personally grew up in a very white majority neighborhood so i feel comfortable growing uplivingraising children in an environment like my own just like literally everyone else i dont feel comfortable in an ethnic enclave because i dont personally agree with the values there absolutely is an issue of assimilation in these communities since they just arent indistinguishable from most communities in america ie whitemajority ones im not saying that all ethnicities ought to assimilate fully in fact i think the opposite but ethnic enclaves often times go in the opposite direction
2617	1	its so horrible when they treat you like the asshole after you yell i hate that i do feel bad but i know what i said was true it just blows my mind away that she tells the whole world about my struggles my ma thinks were too good for boasting so we humble ourselves by telling the world our struggles this fucking woman hell all the aunties and uncles boast about their kids she tells people who we barely know that uni feels like hell right now for me she tells everyone she makes it seem like im a failure in everyones eyes when really im so far ahead of the game i took it easy this year my grades are a bit tanked thats alright my gpa could handle it i took it easy this year and its the happiest i have ever been i stopped caring as much for school i became my own person i got my life together i got my head together im not a dependent emotional woman anymore im a strong woman someone with so much self awareness and strength and precision with each move all that is seen as uselessness in her eyes i will never come to her standards you know what shes doing right now  shes praying fucking praying for me to get better she thinks im a terrible person who has an attitude problem and is mentally fucked up i am driven to absolute insanity its just so sad that i feel this way everyone loves me back in my home home in the city i am an absolute darling i had an award ceremony for a rather prestigious academic award i invited my ma after the ceremony she got talking to this older couple who i am super great friends with they hyped me up i overheard the convo my mom says oh shes not all that great afterwards my mom tells me if only all these people knew how awful i am at homeive always had an on and off relationship with my ma sometimes shes nice and other times shes absolutely cunning i have to deal with her because theres no father figure in my life i have a dad but hes just silent he just works never says a thing i have a sister but her and i never seem to be on the right page either we unite at times about our parents but her stupid brain always goes and tells mom everything i hate that she has her own mental health struggles so i dont get involved much since the negativity is overbearing hows your family life i am set on the military nothing can change that
2618	1	yeah and im saying that theory was proven to be bullshit in 1971 pakistan is a failed extermists state and india is better than them in every way one of them is its treatment of religious minorities they have the moral high ground if india started killing all the non hindus and advocating that they all go to pakistan theyd loose that moral high ground and stoop to pakistan is level
2619	1	dude your awesome keep it up
2620	1	any time i went there all the muslims spoke telugu too
2621	1	httpsyoutubecomwatchvmabab8ap4_a
2622	1	then do something about it either educate folks and be aware it is not like the indian americans who defend india are also defending the negatives of india and history plus you arent directly responsible for what your ancestors did if that is true we are all pieces of shit everyone as long you are you and you are a good person aint nothin wrong with being proud of your heritage
2623	1	well i am pakistani so your screed is kind of pointless to me a minor point but india is still more diverse than intrapakistan differences so by your own logic i should just dismiss you as a proislam pakistani apologist that attempts to excuse any problem that is a bit silly no
2624	1	or an iranian or afghan museum either way there is no reason to it was given by daleep singh what right do any of these countries even have to it
2625	1	gtwhat right do any of these countries even have to iti cannot speak to the indian vs pakistan vs afghanistan vs iran claim but i can say that all have a superior claim to the british who essentially got it as a gift from a young maharaja who had just lost a war if we still live in a world where the victor gains the spoils then fine but lets be honest about that if we dont then the british should return what they stole from the places they destroyed ampx200b
2626	1	excuse after excuse lol
2627	1	which base is that
2628	1	i would be interested in any links  etc thaf you have that would be informative  im a layman but ive always found those subjects interesting
2629	1	yeah they never directly condescend but it is heavily implied oh that is interesting so youre working at x when will you apply to google or oh so it is funny how youre the only one out of all of us not to do medicine or engineering or oh you going to apply to grad school soon to make some real money im not joking and all they talk about at parties is work work work they have very little interesting things going on outside of work like hobbies but this is specific to the uppermiddle class indian community i grew up in the bay area our parents were all uppermiddle class educated doctors engineers etc from iits it could be different elsewhere
2630	1	this shit is hilarious
2631	1	gt this is mostly contributed to ses if its confirmed that its an iq thinglook the average iq for india is in the 80s or something yet indians are the richest minority group on average in the us purely because of social and economic reasons ie relatively well offmiddle class immigrants being the representation of the group nigerians do well in the uk similarly compared to others in britain despite their average iq being lower than britain is where is your iq now
2632	1	im a descendant of indian indentured labourers my ancestors grew up in a colonized society where they were taught to be ashamed of their origins a society which denigrated everything noneuropean we saw ourselves as better than the uncouth indians and savage africans but lesser than europeans whites of french origins were our employers in the sugar cane fields in the mills and in the factories they saw themselves as the frenchmen of africa our schools and work taught us to see ourselves through the same lens the brown frenchmen of africa many of us converted to catholicism and rejected all the indianness in us by changing our names way of speaking and dishes that we cook im simplifying here and glossing over many details in this mauritian context of colonization of the mind some of us have internalized hate toward the country our ancestors came from  this was what schools taught us india is a backward country were more western than them which means we are better except that were still brown in the third world which means were not white and we are lesser people than the civilized europeans i suspect indofijians may have similar mindsets we were taught to look down on india and indians our black brothers harbor similar uncalled for feelings about africa and africans this is the effect of colonization of the mind and culture
2633	1	serious question  what is the point of commenting on this thread if all youre going to do is try to invalidate people is experiences because it is coming off as regressive ignorant and rude as hell especially because the point of this post is literally to not judge
2634	1	how so im from brooklyn and i see this pretty often granted the desi population is pretty high where i am so its probably not as much as im making it seem
2635	1	this it is said that one of the leading indicators of whether a marriage will survive long term is whether the spouses criticize each other in public or in private i think that applies at a community level too to the outside world be each others biggest defenderin a postracial world this would not be a concern but alas
2636	1	by practicing it they are inadvertently laying claim over it as well have you seen how much the original poses have changed due to western influence theyve renamed half the poses as well sullying their meaning and spitting in the faces of the ancient gurus who devoted their lives to yoga
2637	1	trying to learn pashto lol
2638	1	could you elaborate what youre trying to say here
2639	1	nope if you were diagnosed with it there is a high likelyhood that you were kicked in the dick for something bad that you were going to do to a girl
2640	1	great i just pmd you
2641	1	by the same logic the brits gave us railroads and infrastructure that are perhaps infinitely better than the monuments the point being imperialism conquest plunder destruction and in general being a power hungry maniac isnt an example of a good civilizational characteristic
2642	1	man i feel this on a spiritual level
2643	1	lol the cringe is what makes the movie so good haha
2644	1	lol at least that would be accurate
2645	1	haha maybe i think it also has to do with identification my parents seem to identify more with india than the country they live in now even tho theyre us citizens
2646	1	the thumbnail is of a different character the article has a mock up of qureshi
2647	1	youre right there if he really worked hard to get where he is hed understand its value and do whatever it takes to stay or move up there it looks like he doesnt appreciate where he is and needs to realize there are repercussions to his behavior additionally the whole youre acting too western is bakhwas the whole point of america is that its a melting pot and that you can hold on to your culture but also need to assimilate into americas own
2648	1	yeah we have fiji hindi but i get mixed answers as to which language its most related tomy mom says that she found caribbean hindi pretty similar
2649	1	if you werent beaten as a kid you werent raised right yeah right none of my friends got hit as a child and they all turned out fine moreso theyre not afraid to open up to their parents source me i got slappedhit until age 10edit added the source
2650	1	many people do survive mainly on welfare though if they cant start their own company then work some really shitty job like a cleaner or taxi driver etc something which doesnt require a lot of merits there are jobs that pay enough to survive out there but people are used to a living standard thats above something like india which is why people are mentally weaker in usa compared to india some element of danger is required for some people to stop being lazy life is a giant competition after all youre not supposed to get things for free
2651	1	i would imagine there would be a wave among our parents generation and it would peak at 75 before declining
2652	1	i am from indiait is rich youre accusing me of being wannabe white just because i love all kinds of food and love eating meat this is exactly the kind of bullshit that most abcds face from desiindian peoplenews flash people from india like watching hollywood movies like eating meat and like having diverse tastesi am more indian than you can ever be i grew up there for 22 years doesnt mean i cant dislike indian stuff i love indian food and the gujarati language i also love genuinely good hindi movies
2653	1	the beatles on the other handare awesome
2654	1	i think the patriot act is too similar to the 20 other political comedy shows that all pretty much spout the same opinions hes just not original anymore and has absolutely no edge whatsoever
2655	1	one thing i will say i have become very sociable people generally like me and im quite popular ive had a couple of relationships butim still not great at flirtingnonverbal cues they arent necessarily a prerequisite for getting into a relationship but i have improved slowly over time i think what helped was just making a lot of female friends socializing with them becoming a bit more comfortable and also getting insighttips has made me better at talking with girls i still dont really know what im doing however
2656	1	dude i cud be dating an exmuslim and might want a better access to their life issues so i can understand my partner better what has that got to do with the conversation here i only objected to islamism and not muslim i am sure being a pakistani nationalist you can understand that just like you may object to hidutva doesnt mean you hate hindus and the hindu hate is going to eat you alive or some shitdude read up the definition of superpower pakistan is going around begging for a few billion dollars and countries are hesitant in giving away money your currency is depreciating pakistan is struggling with eradicating polio it hardly has its own country under control before desiring a global control how deluded you are
2657	1	still some improvement but i hear ya i know two punjabis who met in med school both same caste and everything i think they dated lived together all in secret but when they got married they had to make it look like it was an arranged married how fucked up
2658	1	i see
2659	1	i completely agree that indians in the us stand a better chance of being considered full american than the ones in uk do of being genuine brits the american identity is far more malleable than european identities which have been ethnostates for the past 2000 years until the past 50 i dont think that memory goes away in a generation or three though i could be wrongas for canada and australia they seem multicultural to the point of losing a shared identity too much immigration in too short a time to be able to define a shared characteristic other than accent and some shared cultural touchpoints not that this atomization isnt the case for the us but its more a matter of degree theres just more room to place yourself in the shared narrative of the country even as a recent immigrant
2660	1	i think its because for me theoretically the person you marry should accept you for who you are and needingasking someone to convert for you is basically saying theres something deeply unacceptable about who you areyour background which is dangerous cultural imperialism for me love whomever you want marry whomever you want but asking them to change a fundamental aspect of their background for you is messed up imo
2661	1	anymore brooklyns peak black population as a percentage was 38 in 1990 its pretty similar now at 35

2665	1	northeastern really
2666	1	some of the shit isnt even a matter of right wing or leftwing its just good banter also the way indians and pakistanis from the land roast each other is funny in a dark sort of way
2667	1	what i meant was that most people are still status driven they might have slightly different critera for what gives perception of status but its still mostly about money in the endamong white people just as with other groups they give different levels of respect depending on what you work with how much money you make and what car you drive how many girls you sleep with and who you date and who you hang out with etc i stand by what i said that status driven mentality is just as prevalent in nondesis compared to other ethnicites desis tend to assign status to academics and profession more than those other traits i guess
2668	1	did you even read op is description she eats beef just to get sadistic pleasure by not obeying her mom how is that normal
2669	1	believe what you will however if you follow all the major recorded events youll find that the timeline corroborates that she was a fair bit older
2670	1	if the government is shut up of course stock market isnt going to do well but it is always best to research the business market first before you would even try to invest in it
2671	1	uhhhi dont think so south asians kind of is to a certain extent a distinct region in terms of its admixture the whole concept of a caucasian race doesnt really hold credence i believe same so with geographically related genes which again hasnt served well as a guide to carve out any sort of races and really confounds the idea of social groupings however i am by no means an expert in this field at all so i cant attest that this isnt something i have just learned from or have a rough understanding over the years
2672	1	then you should stand up for yourself irl where it mattersnot get offended and then go moan about it on the internet like 99 of these postswhy do you think there is all these movements for black people because they refuse to take shit from people irl and band together when a member of their community is victimizedmeanwhile most indians abcds included just point whisper and thank their lucky stars that it isnt them
2673	1	yea it should be choose to overstay illegally get deported

2676	1	im happy that worked out for you dude im not jealous im working towards a degree myself i just thought you really underestimated how hard it is to break into this field a proper ds position not an excel monkey job ive seen managers in companies declare that they need data scientists but they have no clue what they actually do there is people out there who can run models and fiddle with them but might not completely understand the math or assumptions behind those models but i guess you can also make the case that you dont really need to
2677	1	i agree about churchill bro but the us has different sociological dynamics if you dont think racism against black people and native people exist then i dont know what to tell you
2678	1	i mean if anything it is slightly left leaning but also theyre just reporting on exactly what amarinder singh stated like they havent added any bias to this article it is just a restatement of what he mentioned and also corroborated by a bunch of other indian newspapers as amarinder singh is statement on another note india today has had pretty fact based articles and they arent wrong about how sfj is seeking pakistan is supporthttpsreferendum2020org1971dhakafallsfjseekspakistanimrankhanptitosupportit is a different matter that pakistan has not even decided to help them

2680	1	not enough for an opportunist to give up a position in the dnc an actual opportunist would have supported hillary clinton
2681	1	gt great that is the creation of a parallel society now where do you draw the line for when those norms become problematic obviously i draw it when they trump individual human rights like if fundamentalist mormons dont let their daughter marry whoever they want then that is not integration because they arent conforming with the lawas ive repeatedly stated the law of the land anyone who breaks the law is subject to be punished if people choose to ignore the law and they get caught they can be punished lolgt wtf does this have to do with anythingsimply explaining things gt well they should and lot is of countries are changing that right now the next set of elections and europe and elsewhere will be a bit bigmore power to them gt that went completely over your head didnt it individual rights trump communal rightsi understand the argument you are making it just doesnt hold any value in communal societies not to mention youre ignorant of how or why individualism or communalism racists short answer in societies where economic oppertunties are a plenty law and order exists state protects the safety of citizens there is no longer a need for communal living otherwise communal living are essential for having access to resources some form of justice and survival of individuals theres a reason communal living has always been the preferred method of living for societies bar the last 100120 years where humanity has made great strides especially post wwii when us greately increases production and went on to popularize consumerism gt again you are conflating integrating and assimilating assimilating means letting your children if they so choose become christian in america or muslim in pakistan since you are conflating the two so often i think you might want to check the dictionarynot at all im speaking about integration which can and does often leave to assimilation gt so you should take catholicism and christianity classes where you live right now good pointimplying that i support your argument for integration implying us isnt a secular nation maybe dont spend time on altright forums that might help gt well culture is irrelevant when compared to basic human rightsto you maybe but not to nations like pakistan hey your argument was that of integration not mine i simply told you that you cant complain about treatment of minorities in pakistan or even india if you favor forced education for the purposes of integration gt again see abovei did and you simply are unwilling to acknowledge the fact that your argument would lead to justification of what minorities in pakistan go through gt well it actually is because individual rights protects your religion in the west if we existed communally as in pakistan christianity would be enforced and pressured on youdo you think my personal protections in the us are somehow an objective bases of an argument lol gt ah pretending to be objective are we rules for thee not for meobjective as in not being an ideologue and understanding the reasons for why communal living exists and is required vs when communalism diminishes and allows room for individualism to take hold and grow if you dont understand the sociology of how societies work what institutional and economic factors play a role in societal shifts then you might be stuck acting like an ideologue you kind of have to raise your self above these things and enter the domain of anthropology 101 if you want to further explore your ideas
2682	1	heyyyy  fellow sfsu gatorampx200b

2686	1	unpopular opinion british indians are only as integrated as they are there because they tend to be the lighter skinned variety and im looking forward to someone posting pics of a dark bollywood actor to claim that most people in the uk are at least this darkas a darker skinned desi i would much rather be in the us than anywhere else in the world our people here have made their way to the upper rungs of society and even media now despite more racial bias against them and that raises the status of all indians worldwide not just the wheatishly blessed

2693	1	people like you dont care about anything trump says or does it is always but he didnt proclaim himself a racist while decapitating a black person and burning a muslim to death so therefore he isnt racist just get off this sub
2694	1	because most proreligionracedemographicnationality movements usually are political ploys to pit people against one another for votes dont get me wrong im prohindu as well if we can safely advocate and extoll the benefits and values of hinduism without putting down others then by all means we should go for it  the problem is that most prohindu movements usually get mixed up with hindu nationalistic groups even if they dont want to

2711	1	to be honest older hindu civilisations were very liberal however post the onslaught of islamic invaders whuch left them poor and the settling in of the rulers which led to the inter mixing of cultures actually led to both religions adopting features of the other then came the british which was even more suppressing it was all downhill from there
2712	1	gtfuck the gop bunch of white nationalistswhatthe guy who introduced the bill is a republican not sure if youre trolling or didnt actually read the bill

2720	1	well less about adopting religious customs from other religions and more to the fact that as an abrahamic religion our perspective of jesus is what sets us apart from christianity so it doesnt make sense for us to celebrate christmas its the same with a lot of observant jews too who dont celebrate christmas theres no such ideological clash with hinduism or other dharmic religionsthere are plenty of nonislamic holidays celebrated in the muslim world based on cultures many of them predating islam norooz is the most common one that comes to mind thats celebrated among iranic peoples ranging from iraq and turkey all the way into indiathat being said ive come across muslims recently who celebrate a secularized version of christmas at times not even calling it that ive even seen pictures of christmas trees put up in the public in doha qatar

2723	1	gti can put up a video of a hindu christian or sikh congressperson in pakistan saying everything is good for minorities and it doesnt change the fact that it isntoh that is so precious you think there are non muslim congressmen in pakistan who think that everything is good for minoritiesherehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvacmzzfbjbbg let me help you outgt the only difference is that people in pakistan actually are acknowledging that shit is bad and are striving to make things bettersure buddy the country whose chief export product is terrorist nutjobs is striving to make things better too bad it doesnt seem to be working

2732	1	i am hoping that bjp will lose badly in the coming elections in rajasthan and telangana that is what they deserve for bringing in yogi for campaigning having said that political campaigns by abcd orgs will not work they will just be repainted as foreign interference in india is internal politics bjp might actually benefit from them see what happened when the us denied visa to modi it pissed off many indians that a bunch of orgs that they never heard about or care about have put an elected cm on trial in a foreign country abcd orgs are too far out of touch with indian politics to mount any effective campaigns if you really want to change something then you must do it in india or else you will be just another out of touch abcdnri who thinks he knows what is best for india from half way across the globe

2739	1	well there really shouldnt be a jewish cause or indian cause that is the kind of tribalistic thinking that causes racism and we as a human race have moved beyond that our goal should be to eliminate racism to get people to see indians as equal
2740	1	every wimbledon award ceremony the royal who runs it walks on court to present the prizes but on the way he straight up just flirts with the ball girls and it is always so fucking gross to watch this bald crypt keeper looking motherfucker just rubbing ball girl hands and staring into their eyes whispering weird shit at themso obvious that guy has a full harem of underage children to abuse it is insane theyre pretending like they dont have a huge problem with it in house

2748	1	well for me its because my hair is fine and thin so coconut oil takes forever to get washed out but i spend a lot of time on the curlyhair sub here and a lot of folks who have proteinsensitive hair get strawlike brittle hair after applying coconut oil so check for that i would say my hair loves protein so i do use coconut oil but very sparingly every so few months

2750	1	true we should be helping poor people in general it just so happens that many of them are black letting them fix it hasnt been going well at all which is why government intervention mainly in school quality is needed

2753	1	you can have two truths even multiple truths going on at the same time there is no cancelling out that man in mississippi can honor his great great great grandfather who was a good person in that time period by showing the flag that is one truth the flag can also represents the treatment and feelings towards black americans who were seen as property than as human beings that is another truth another truth that can be added is that while the man is relative may be a good man he fought for a nation that didnt see black people as human beings but rather as property while the relative may not be an evil person he indirectly and directly supported the flag and its intentions so you can see it is mad complicated and takes a civil discussion to unpack it allyes india hasnt been the best towards women and poor nation you can add a lot of nations to that list but in this day and age countries are changing whether it be for the good or bad you just have to hope we are all moving to a better direction than what the past had to offerleft wing politics isnt perfect same for right wing politics you can easily dismantle the ideology of each and find it to have flaws no ideology is perfect there is no such thing the best thing to do is to educate yourself and fit that ideology the best to how you wanna live
2754	1	hear hear on not conforming to desi standards

2790	1	how long does it take you to make rice most rice cookers these days can knock it out in around 2030 min
2791	1	youre absolutely right the thing is the general philosophy of pedagogy in india originally not just for art but for everything but now it is mainly for art is one of submission the ideal student is one who completely submits to the teacher the student is basically a slave to the teacher for years and years and years      there is some belief not just in india but everywhere around the world and especially so in indoeuropean cultures that the best artists manage this sort of sublimation of self and the best art comes out of pain it is largely nonsense and a romanticized view of how art works gilbert is famous ted talkhttpswwwtedcomtalkselizabeth_gilbert_on_genius deals with how wrong this is so does gadsby is nanettehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5ae29fiatq0    so yeah the abuse amp closemindedness amp hierarchy is deliberate and based on the abusiveteacheristhebestteacher fallacy however it is true that to do anything well especially something complicated like art or sport at the highest levels requires deep longterm immersion and it is incompatible with regular life in the sense it is not for dilettantes i guess maybe the abuse is designed to weed out the dilettantes
2792	1	ya i dont understand these type of posts makes me wonder how close these people are to their families that they feel the need to share the details of their sex life with family lol
2793	1	gtall these personal insults and accusations yet you claim there is no butthurt lol you being an incel is a fact of life not a butthurt comment gti simply made an observable and rational point about non muslim south asian girls being more promiscuous than their muslim south asian counter parts which is you bringing up the purity of women gtthe fact that indian hindus so often complain about indian girls preferring whites paints a very telling picturewhat exactly that some indian incels are upset that their women have freedom of choice i mean at least they have the opportunity to chose their partner unlike you know muslim women gtthat culture is going to have far more women who are less promiscuousor they simply do it in secret like in iran gtill extend an olive branch to help you understand non muslim indian culture prizes piety as well although to a lesser degree in this scenario girls raised in non muslims south asian culture on average will be less promiscuous than their white american and european counterparts who dont much value in piety and this is supposed to make people better or something lol little incel you are going to be fantasizing about sex for a long time
2794	1	gt lecithinbeware lecithin from soy it increases estrogen amp therefore paradoxically decreases breastmilk production lecithin from eggs and food sources is different  that is the good stuff

2812	1	in canada stephen harper managed to be successful because of his success among immigrants in the gta and in vancouver doug ford also managed to win premier of ontario because of immigrants if andrew scheer isnt a total fool he could do the same thing because people from indiachinakorea are really averse to big budgetary deficits and justin has been incompetent at keeping his promises on it republicans are a completely different beast because of the trump effect but canadian conservatives will absolutely win with immigrants if they campaign well
2813	1	not very many indians where i wa from when i was young so my parents found them and everyone helped each other other out some would sponsor others families to immigrate loans between families networking and finding each other dealls like steals on houses it even formalized to a nonprofit community group it went from a few families to a few dozen now to hundreds of families and my parents were on the ground floor

2822	1	yes you can fiddle with algorithm but it depends on the time and money involved part of what i do is with finance aspect do i need a 90 accurancy with preexisting solid workable algorithm or spend 23 months fiddling to get 92 accurancy id rather use the preexisting algorithm most of the time i spent explaining data are used with powerbi or tableau its not easy but i spent lot of time reading andrew ngs books and took online classes on coursera and udemy i networked with data scientists and attend workshops but if you are dedicated it is possible i learn faster with projects on the job than in classes and theories at first i thought it was intimidating but i realized that its all same math formulas we used in college and high school but more convulated and expanded so thats what made it look intimidating but i enjoy it its fun to play with database and seeing the graphs
2823	1	and my axe
2824	1	say it with me j o k e

2831	1	gtlol well at least you found out sooner rather then later that she wasnt the brightest person in some aspectspeople do silly things when they are drunk lol she did say she will hit me up if she is ever in chicago again a couple of daysnights of fun doesnt require intellectual prowess so thats that
2832	1	im neither and no its not ridiculous nor cruel its justice and righteous this generation of british people may not be directly responsible but they all benefit from it and most of them take pride in it and also they think they are superior because of it they even glorify churchill but are keen to complain about gandhi to even things out we need to dominate them i dont care if many of them die as a result so that they get humbled and then after that we can try become friends again if they want but we need to put them in their place which is below us

2838	1	if your culture is sexist racist misogynistic then im sorry your culture has big issues it is not a question of multiculturalism if the latter could be used as an excuse then all sorts of reprehensible acts could be excused by it i could say you cant jail me for murdering a gay person homosexuality isnt cool for my culture so i must kill homosexualsgt he hasnt sexually harassed anyone or crossed personal boundaries  picking up your family photo is on the border but i suspect it is his  way of complimenting you and say you have a nice family to me and perhaps to a bunch of other people it sure sounds like this guy is crossed personal boundaries quite a few times it seems like he has a misogynistic streak in him which shows that he discriminates against female colleagues by telling them they should be parenting instead of working i doubt he says the same thing to male colleagues if this is not genderbased discrimination i dont know what is
2839	1	i knew math since high school statistics linear algebra and basic calculus basic subjects everyone obviously know this prior to college regardless of the degree they pursue in college but of course a science track student would be getting more maths in their coursework
2840	1	yeah but its kinda annoyingly true i worked as a pizza boy one summer and desi people would give me maybe 50c1 while everyone else would give at a minimum 3 i wish it wasnt like this

2843	1	i know that feeling all too well where you feel responsible for the mental health of your parents and guilty about seeking your own happiness i felt undeserving of their love given that they had struggled and suffered and i couldnt reciprocatepay them back for all that they did for me i still feel that waythis sounds cliche in an era of people posting this sort of thing as hashtags and instagram captions to make themselves feel better but real talk rather than letting yourself become a vessel for them to unburden their sorrows on you could try overwhelming positivity even if you dont 100 believe it you could keep talking to them about the positives in life that youre a family that you have each other that were only on this earth a short while and need to take joy in whatever journey there is to be had for my parents i tell them that maybe they should move back to india and prioritize their bigpicture life happiness over shortterm financial securities if youre going to grad school for something that is easily employable i guarantee you youre better off taking loans and finishing it up if it is something that you think isnt easily employable well youre wrong ive seen advertising majors from tiny liberal arts schools run business analytics divisions in terms of going corporate if you can project confidence and think of any business applications of your academic work you can get white collar internshipsemployment pretty easily companies that value their employees are also fairly understanding of familyfinancial struggles being a reason for someone to leave school and go into the workforce

2853	1	gtabout desisasians broadly moving to like america and the uk with ones entire family but desperately holding on and trying to maintain the really conservative aspects of their culture even if its clearly incongruous with the societyplace theyre living nowi dont have any proof for this but i would argue that what i described above contributes to a significant financial burden physical and mental health expenses court cases and obvious psychological burden particularly for first generation asian americans growing up trapped between 2 culturesampx200btime capsule effect a lot of immigrants when moving abroad carry the time period they were living in with them even though most parts of their native countries change and move on probably due to the the fact that they are not living through the continuous changes and are still in that snapshot of time my mom still thinks india is the exact same like her era though she acknowledges minor changes though some may be cultural a lot of it is generational i would say as i met many older americans who are pretty old fashioned in their thoughts and yea it is a huge dilemma for us third culture kidsampx200b
2854	1	why cant it be both iraq was a relatively stable country despite being under a brutal dictatorship it had functioning civil institutions and the usuk launched a campaign of destruction based on false pretenses the threat of a wmd attack on the westisrael they fucked up monumentally and played a pretty active role in spewing sectarian conflict that led to the birth of isis and an ongoing conflict in the countrywhile the syrian civil war did develop natively the usfranceuk poured weapons into the country to ensure that war would continue weakening the country while staying far away enough to make sure that assad continues to stay in power

2860	1	feeling proud of anything definetly diminshes the feeling but having too much anxiety self doubt etc arent good eitherimo its better to be proud of everything you accomplish then to be stuck in a rut feeling like youve accomplished nothing i think you are being hard on yourself being able to find positivity in any situation can improve your overall life quality
2861	1	oh cmon like you never fantasized about white girls
2862	1	in one of these last religious posts someone who has a far greater understanding of hinduism than i do said that its possible to be an atheist yet still be a practicing hindu i wish i could remember the reason they stated but it was something along the lines of hinduism emphasizes spirituality above all so a belief in dieties isnt needed
2863	1	foreign interference in what the report is 50 pages long and i am willing to bet money that none of the people here read it all i read the barfi culture article they seem to say that there was an indian campaign to paint canadian agencies as incompetent because they failed to screen that terrorist i dont see anything wrong with that if the canadians cannot find a convicted terrorist in their pms guest list what confidence will indians have that they will find a plot to blow up another plane out of the sky it tells me that they are not taking our concerns about radical khalistanis seriously there may not be many of them left in canada but just a few are enough to cause a lot of damage
2864	1	sure im of the belief that once a rapist always a rapist i dont think thats something that can actually be changed personally i would like to see all rapists either given the death penalty of chemical castration it would serve as a deterrent for any of these other fools who want to rape regardless i can think of scenarios where killing somebody would be okay or at least justified i cant think of any scenarios where rape is okay of course i would only want the death penalty in situations like this where the proof is obvious and there isnt much wiggle room to prove ones innocence maybe its just me but i think going to prison for rape is too easy youre ruining somebodys life and in some cases ending their life 9 years of prison is nothing compared to a lifetime full of fear and psychological problems im just a regular dude and ive been in mischief in my life fights stealing drugs etc one thing me and my crew would never do was disrespect women in even the slightest sense we beat up this one dude robbed him for his shoes and made him walk 4 miles home barefoot for roofying this girl and almost raping her she woke up before anything happened and still 5ish years later i still think we shouldve messed him up more
2865	1	gtwhile speaking hindi or gujaratigujarati seriously they are just different even in indiai have heard gujarati both in usa and india are pretty much closed community discourse marriage or other activities outside their communitygt lucky we are to come from two great countries guess im idealistic in wishing that we all people in the homeland and outside the homeland just try to treat each other with respect and come together especially regarding social issues that effect our communityunless india become a truly developed country and have strong liberty right a desi in india or in foreign land will not get same respect as while folks they will always face discrimination and looked down i know this sounds philosophical or stupid shit but really tough to explain here why am i saying this in writingif you look japanese  russian  taiwan or even mainland china are overcoming this issue including brazilian

2868	1	so you said you read my posts yet youre saying im only negative towards indians ive been harassed by folks in rchutyapa for my anti pakistan viewsif thats what youre referring to the only insecure person i see is the one accusing others of being white if you were comfortable with yourself you wouldnt even give a damn about my identity
2869	1	no i read it it doesnt change my mind i said half of the country as a figure of speech but you knew that didnt youindia has 1 billion people sure but thats ignoring the 50 million impoverished based on your stats just like pakistan they spend money on stupid shit instead of taking care of their own yeah lets spend money on our nuclear weapons and a statue forget the slums that sit right outside of the taj mahal indias poverty is infinitely worse than americas poverty but america isnt wasting half a billion dollars on a dumb ass statue
2870	1	yeah it is not like the indian govt is clean they committed crimes against minorites 1984 2002 but i dont see you using the same energy on calling them out
2871	1	ill admit im a bit more conscious of white people owing me moneysensory memories are different btw when you associate a memory with a smell its almost unforgettable and unfortunately memories of his lies and controlling instinct come rushing back the moment i smell anything resembling that dick cheese smell

2874	1	gt the indian military has been massacring and raping kashmiri muslims for decadesthat is how you exert power on a frontier province with geo political relevance it is unfortunate that this is true for all such locations around the world and conflicts and for the abcdesis who are americans citizens it is being complicit in rapemurderpillage of countries around the world in name of oilfreedomfightingcommunismnot sure who is trying to get a moral high grounds in this discussion pakistanis indians or americanscanadians

2876	1	how do the children of these migrants fare do they try to create a balance of their home life and outside life school etc and struggle with it because they certainly are being exposed to things outside of their respective communities for sure i hear mixed responses that there are some that actually do integrate and others are closed off
2877	1	gti am not saying it is true about 100 of bangladeshis it is true about 90 bangladeshis for example a  bangladeshi would ask another which district the other is from when meeting someone new and then hed make some assumption about characters simply based on his birthplaceno it is basically trying to project prejudice on two identical beings based upon some assumed factors
2878	1	from my personal experiences the cliqueyness came from making false promises mainly by girls to invite me to stuff and not really including me in things despite me reaching out also ive been to a few of their events on campus and it seems like everyone already knows everyone and its a bit awkward when people stare at me but dont greet memaybe theyre not aware of when they stare and how long they do it loli think its totally fine to not speak english and i understand international students being more likely to stick together in a foreign country like the us especially if they come from a particular countryregion im also vegetarian so id love to have indian vegetarian friends who understand and relate to my dietary preferences and how i was raised but maybe im more likely to relate to that in abcds than fobs

2891	1	ignoring the fact that this was done because gandhi was obsessed with removing the urge of lust from his life due to the grief he felt after the night of his father is passing i dont know if it really needs to be said but im not uncritical of gandhi across the board just the race bit indians above all should take issue with him for what he did to other indians wrt castehttpswwwmkgandhiorgarticlescelibacyhtm
2892	1	if you are implying that i would hold posters that said smash whitemale patriarchy or white tears etc then you are wrong i wouldnt hold them nor would i try and defend the people who hold themgt say it with me casteism is bad you should not shy away from criticizing it just because fundamentalists get upsetyou are confusing criticising casteism with criticising this poster they are not the same one can criticise both and still be consistent i dont see the point in creating controversy and then wasting effort trying to defend posters like these when you could be doing something else i think i will try in my own way to reduce the discrimination feel free to continue with these posters if you think that they are the best way to combat caste discrimination
2893	1	gtjust to say that discussions on these topics is important and necessary and shouldnt be shut downagreed alas reddit admins also crack down heavily on abuse hate speech trolling and stuff so a lot of times mods have to abide by those rules or loose the whole sub

2907	1	my dad is shia my mom is sunni i was raised sunni
2908	1	agreed because our children will living in a different time period than we are just like we are living in a different time period than our parents and hence have different beliefs and ideas than our parents how many of us are actually expressing all the cultural values think the exact same and have the same exact beliefs just like our parents honestly most of it is generational because this applies to all countries and each generation is different our children will never always follow suit with everything we try to pass down and they will always create an identity and culture that is different than ours the concept of culture needs to be discussed because it is something that always changes and evolves and is never stagnant and our kids version of culture will be different from our version somehow it seems a lot of people just do not understand this
2909	1	abcds is less offensive term fobs which is a racist term

2917	1	gt actually that is a bit of a misnomer only if you extract incorrect understanding from what is being stated i never said integration and assimilation were the same things lolgt you see integration means a group is embedded into a larger society is economic and legal foundationsuh noooooooo that isnt what it means at all you could be a productive member of a society and still choose to live in a closed community and follow the norms of that parallel society which youve stated is actually problematic because that isnt integration as for the laws brv laws apply to closed off immigrants just as they apply to the long term citizens native to the land sure if that community wants to use legal and democratic avenues to have the laws of the land changed well then thats just part in parcel of democracies  you dont have to like it but it has nothing to do with your ideas regarding integration gt well again you have no proof so at this very moment it is irrelevant that is like me denying you are pakistani a pointless insult but it looks worse on you than me tbhyou can say whatever you want about it im not invested in trying to convince anyone of my pakistaniyat lol the fact that youre trying to argue that you a pakistani and an exmuslim simply adds to my position gt you didnt make it clear when you wrote that sentence it was plenty clear gt anyways as i said so long as my basic human rights are respected i should be expected to integrate and at least give my children the option of assimilating if i dont personally want towell than that would mean youd have to follow the cultural norms instead of calling it the worst thing ever while you can have you beliefs youd still have to act as a muslim in a country that is 98 muslim your kids would eventually assimilate and become muslims im kind of digging your idea of integration already gt good we agreeour agreement doesnt mean when low breeding countries with a high economic output which requires foreign labor are going to start acting proactively when drafting their immigrant integration policies maybe one day they might but for now they draft their institutional and state level integration policies as a fix for things they realize arent workinggt the only catch is you are comparing apples and oranges the individualist rights framework of the west gives you the choice and opportunity to participate in a society at your own volition and if you come from backwards places that dont respect those rights you should be at least educated to that frameworkbut youre the one saying integration should be forced weve already agreed that law of the land applies to all citizens and immigrants also if you want immigrants to start accepting individualism as supreme then that would mean since pakistan is a communal society that requires conformity non muslim minorities and exmuslims should be forced to integrate in to the majority of pakistani society gt lol as if those islamiyat classes werent doing that alreadyintegration gt and doesnt make it any less of a problemi dont think its a problem at all south asian culture doesnt put much weight on the individual is preferences serving your purpose in a family is more important in south asian cultures obviously when you move into a society that prizes individualism the cultural clash will produce a lot of friction within families its the natural process of how things work calling it good or bad is a narrow minded way of not seeing what is happening and complaining because of your own biases an objective approach is required to understand these issues
2918	1	added
2919	1	you are very correct i apparently have spent so long correcting people im not indian im guyanese that im doing it to myself now
2920	1	explain usually intercultural im using this word specifically couples are irreligious and acultural thereby preventing the passing on of indian culture and hindu religion islam if ur a muslim
2921	1	lol she has a boyfriend not a husband youve still got a pretty good shot soonwould reccomend rum over vodka
2922	1	it is all relative to some degree though a waiter is time is a fixed variable if a waiter decides that i am going to leave a poor tip and therefore makes themselves less available to me and my group then theyre going to get a poor tip and then theyll assume i tipped worse because im desimeanwhile the reality is that they checked on becky is table three times in the past 20 minutes just to get shooed away while i was lucky to get their attention so that i could ask for the bill let alone water
2923	1	if they wait that long though they will most of the time not be able to get as good catch of a man as they could during their prime around 2224 years of age men can afford to wait a lot longer without any dips in quality

2928	1	idk why everyone hates on slumdog millionaire they cant dissociate their indianness from viewing the film i think it is an objectively amazing film and i think it is incredibly offensive towards india and indian poverty these two feelings arent mutually exclusive
2929	1	actual republican desis are morons who fall for white supremacy democrat desis ignore blatant discrimination from the party both parties are total garbage for desis because we dont stand up for ourselves on either side of the spectrum

2934	1	nah mumbai is pretty liberal overall talking politics in india is a little sketch though unless you know who youre with never know how someone will react
2935	1	gtif the government is shut up of course stock market isnt going to do well but it is always best to research the business market first before you would even try to invest in ituhhhhh it is not just the government shut down that is dictating the stock market how about you try and time the market for a few years and show me the performancetiming the market is so ineffective that warren buffet even made a bet  a million dollar bethttpswwwforbescomsitesjohnwasik20180108howbuffettwonhis1millionbet8a0b55c2a6cd
2936	1	yeah normal rice cookers have this problem of not really draining water properly like they were designed for cooking asianstyle sticky rice but not for the al dente style basmati rice that makes pulaos and biryanis really pop having an instant pot allows you to finetune the water quantities and cooking times a bit better so you end up getting this magical combination that is consistently reproduceable across multiple instant potsmy instant pot definitely makes the list of the top 5 things where i think where i got my money is worth and then some out of it my sister hasnt used a conventional steam pressure cooker in years and honestly those noisy fuckers terrify the shit out of me so im more than happy to use this thing instead
2937	1	this is hard to articulate and will probably ruffle feathers but i kinda see what he means as someone who isnt quite abcd or a proper desi either nonwestern diaspora the thing is that when interacting with abcd is or other westernborn desis there is this distinct sense of discomfort they appear to have where it almost feels like theyre subconsciously communicating with everyone around them who might be observing them going hey guys im not with this desi guy im like you im a ltinsert local nationality heregt as if theyre desperately worried that even being seen talking to a proper desi person is going to tarnish how their peers see them and it is practically palpable in the eyes of the desis themselves it is like high school and where youre embarrassed to be seen talking with a group of people because you know youre going to catch shit for it however with white folks or other nondesi immigrants they dont give a shit and they arent embarrassed to be seen speaking with you if they can help it even in my own current office here in canada the white folksother nationalities have been easier to get along with than the other indocanadians whove kept me at arms length because theyre worried about optics   there are folks in my own office that give off that vibe whenever you talk to them about anything and it is just a major putoff  theyre nice people but at the same time i get it youre canadianamericanbritishetc i know we come from different worlds and im sorry if i cramp your style but for fuck is sake dont unperson me because you have issues dealing with reconciling your ideas of the culture of your national origin and the country youre in or your personality
2938	1	you dont have to listen to all of them if you dont want to but definitely  listen to the first section of rappers that reccomended

2948	1	edit i just want to clarify that i agree with you im hoping that the person you replied to reads this since i was attempting to expand on your pointin fact the op stated exactly the opposite of this in his disclaimeri think he brought up a very palpable and valid concern and is asking for sincere advice in what to do in his singular situation especially given that his actions may have direct ramifications on a coworker is visa status nowhere does he make any blanket statements or advocate for uneducated stereotypes rather he comes across as rather polite and wellinformed on cultural norms for someone who has migrated from elsewhereregardless of his desire to tread carefully however it seems that the choice is clear based on the words of others in this thread with whom i agree  his coworker has already chosen to fail to demonstrate even a modicum of cultural assimilation despite what im sure are repeated signs of implicit discomfort with his behavior from his peers
2949	1	i rest my case gatekeeping to the max acting as if people are lesser because they have differing viewpoints  ethnocentrism
2950	1	then dont talk about india like you know everything have you even heard of the strong separatist sentiment going on in tamil nadu have you ever read comments online by tamillians they are the most arrogant chauvinistic delusional retard fucks ive ever seen ive met many tamillians but never had a positive experience with even one of them

2953	1	gttheyre all too quick to pull up the ladder behind them and call for the end of welfare and immigrationyou imply that we want to end all legal immigration when its illegal immigration that doesnt make sense our parents waited in line legally to become us citizens or green card holders rewarding illegal immigration is rewarding policy violations at the expense of all others who wait in line legally
2954	1	the fact youve spammed this whole comment thread with iterations of this comment the fact people have run ads and hired billboards on times square seems to indicate his fans do care
2955	1	live your best life
2956	1	you mean this not bear
2957	1	i dont know about this ive known quite a few arab and persian christians who pass as white in public it is easier to pass when your name isnt muhammad bilal saeed or ali though these guys usually have typical anglo names or maybe greek names
2958	1	gt we dont handle vulnerability or empathy well as humansi would replace that with we dont handle vulnerability or empathy well as desi

2960	1	yeah she is in na im thinking that no one is going to advise me to wait and see haha might see if she can come over instead might allow us to spend a bit more time together then
2961	1	ya given that vocals alternate with consonants it is reasonably easy
2962	1	nope this is a result of there being so many indians who now have access to the internet in spite of being relatively poor and uneducated there are also many nonindian trolls who spread that meme further and even pretend to be an indian online the average indian guy is no more cringy than any other race
2963	1	why is welfare a wedge issue though given that most indian at least immigrants come in relatively high on the income ladder
2964	1	he was being sarcastic
2965	1	he  made a tseries diss track  the song is all about india and stereotyping indians there is just one line about tseriesimagine being a guy who isnt aware of  pewdiepie  and you encounter these guys spreading racial abuse under his name  replying your youtube comments with racial abuse just coz you are listening music in your languagethat diss track kind of started this shitsomeone from his side needs to address this issueedit  typos

2971	1	nehru and khushwant singh were also le euphoric anglophilic bootlickers whose indianess extended only skin deep you literally posted a jain quote arguing for nireshvarvad nontheism which is not what we understand today as atheism ie godless materialism with a purely naturalistic metaphysics jains worship an entire host of deities tirthankaras spirits and planets and have their own metaphysics and cosmology stop falsely appropriating indigenous philosophies as warrant for your godlessness
2972	1	that school was like 50 brown back in my day what is the ratio like now
2973	1	mountain climbing is intense only do it if you arent afraid of heights wow execrable never thought id hear that being used in a sentence  yeah the gym is a tricky spot i mostly go there to work on myself and its kind of a safe retreat but maybe try smiling at a guy at the gym and see if they reciprocate if they do then either you can go talk to them or they can come up to you also cardio is a good time to talk sounds like you got this keep having fun in life and eventually it will all fall into place

2983	1	take the risk it is worth it
2984	1	actually the rapid right wing goverment is not the one who committed the pograms of 1984 it was the left wing government who is their opposition though i myself dislike almost all the political parties in india for being extremely ineffective and corrupt
2985	1	that ist my solution america isnt postracial so i dont know why you spouting that crapi only disagreed with the commenter above that poor asians have the worst chance which isnt true at all again all of you antiaa people talk as if you want to remove racial preferences but still downplay the hard work that the mexican black or native american students did to get into the ivy league and say that they only got in because of their race not every wealthy nigerian is walking into harvard and not every hmong kid is being rejected from every college because he is asianagain going back to the original point of the article what to we really define as success if success is only going into ivy leagues then only a single digit percent of the entire us population is successful if that is your definition then go ahead have at it
2986	1	oh boy i understand like 3040 of the punjabi words and 100 of the english words but i am unable to sketch the full picture of the song ya feel me also the singers are canadianindian so it is probably not a crazy dialect

2988	1	i dont care much for persians and turks but i think it is a poor comparison to make for a few reasonsampx200bnader shah plundered delhi the british plundered the entire country he was involved in a war w various powers including the mughals sikhs marathas etc the british did the same but nader shah was more interested in plunder as a result of those wars than he was with conquering and ruling the country for the benefit of the united kingdom the british did not settle down in india they ruled it as a foreign entity today you dont have people who are british settled in india and became a fabric of the country unlike past foreign forces who became a part of the subcontinentampx200bfinally nader shah did not leave india pretending that he did a lot of good the british left india and pretended to this day that they were a force of good and wash away the evils their empire did for almost 150 years
2989	1	i would say due to population white girls but percentage wise asian girls im talking esse so desi girls included this is for looksfor dating it would be desi girls then ese asian then white

2995	1	grounds for incarceration deportation idk
2996	1	gt women can marry a nonmuslim if they convert men can marry a jew or a christian without them converting but any other religion or no religion would have to convertsee its that double standard that is problematic

3001	1	young whites voted overwhelmingly for trump
3002	1	i dont eat halal anymore if you read the rest of my post you would know that me not having options is me wanting to be white im embarrassing myself yet here you are making false dichotomies left and right sorry for not eating vegetarian sorry but i grew up eating meat doing a complete 180 and eating strictly vegetarian from outside isnt something i do you have to keep in account that vegetarian options are more expensive than meat options and fast food go to mcdonalds get a meal for 4 get a salad for 7 you see my point in what way does this make me white there it zero basis to your claims so rchutyapa is the same victim mentality found in me and youre a part of it and means youre sporting a victim mentality as well funny how that works huh not familiar with the other subreddit youre referring to but every single person ive ever encountered on this sub that was also a part of rchutyapa has had a history of misogynistic ethnocentric and bigoted comments i doubt youre the exception
3003	1	they do have to justify to society hence why there is such contempt for gen z  do we not live with social norms with etiquette they messed up by hiring him  when you hire a comedian this isnt what you do and just because they are organizers doesnt make it a dictatorship  absolutely no sense of social normsdo they not understand the fucking point of comedians sounds like their education isnt paying off
3004	1	amma jee always knows next level spite

3012	1	if your routine is working for you stick with it coconut oil doesnt necessarily work for everyone for me its a bit too heavy so i stick with almond oil and my regular conditionertreatment mask
3013	1	is coconut oil better for those with thick voluminous hair
3014	1	tbh ive seen more pakistanis in the us bashing india than the other way around for the most part it is kind of accepted in the us esp since the capture of obl in pakistan that pakistan is nowhere near the level of india and there is no point in bashing it this wasnt the case before then i dont think in the eyes of westernersthough i could be wrong i have a feeling the reason pakistani americans bash india stems from their own insecurity of their heritage
3015	1	gt  there were some cases of killings but to assume that the sole purpose of army is just killing people is absolutely absurdis even one extrajudicial killing justified in a country that is proud to declare itself a democratic society as much of it is fiction there are some truths as shown in the movies rojadil se check those out for some context of the conflicts on india is frontiers and also internal conflicts in india is coal country
3016	1	im kannadiga and my gf is gujurati she is willing to learn kannada she is trying if i learn hindigujurati i can understand some words in hindi but i dont speak it this is ironic cause i went to india for med school but i still didnt manage to learn hindi
3017	1	im white im fine with it just dont call me ghoda and we cool
3018	1	name and shame
3019	1	youre coming off as unnecessarily aggressive i dont think my parents ever required me to convert anyone not that i think i have that power or anything they simply told me that whoever i choose to marry they have to be muslim when i was heading for college they sat me down and gave me the birds and the bees speech along with advising me to not mess around with girls focusing on studies and when im ready for marriage even it be during college their only caveat is to ensure my wife to be is a muslim i met my wife 7 years after that talk gt but what you did by converting her is neither going to help the wider muslim community or any future couples involving a muslimi never stated i converted her she was a convert prior to our meeting i only found out about her back ground months after we had been friends i dont know why you think muslims marrying converts is somehow an agenda to help the wider muslim community honestly this is a really bad conspiracy that is spread out and it genuinely hurts couples who are in love
3020	1	then move back to india if you dont like living here in the west youre gonna bitch about how the west is doing this but take advantage of everything it has to offer youre no different than an economic migrant from a third world
3021	1	all conflicts start somewhere but very rarely do they get resolved based on only when and how they started it may be somewhat relevant but i dont think any party in the conflict today would be happy to resolve it just based on the merits of how it started and who caused it last i heard of it insurgency started because kashmiris believed indira gandhi rigged a state electionthanks ig but i dont think the separatists of today would be happy with just an indian promise to hold a fair election and withdraw the military if that were the case this issue would have been resolved long ago they will continue until they eliminate everyone they see as an enemy and achieve their goal regardless of how many people in the valley actually support their goal
3022	1	came to see if anyone would post nav lol
3023	1	i never understood why people complain about people dating outside their race and ethnicity it just comes off as insecurity

3026	1	if they were latin americans muslims or africans they would probably like it wayyyy less
3027	1	hmm not sure either way that would tie in with the she has flopped in hollywood has to go back to bollywood this is a desperate move by a desperate woman i wouldnt care if it wasnt for the fact that she was such a piece of shit of a woman
3028	1	maybe im a bit paranoid about this lol literally every female ive ever asked for advice has said that hygiene and particularly bad breath are the biggest turn off and couple that with the terrible stereotypes that indian dudes have i had a date with a girl about 3 weeks ago and literally brushed my teeth and tongue 3 times before and chewed gum on the way there ahahaha but thats probably just a me problem
3029	1	are you talking about sikh nationalism and selfdetermination in canada
3030	1	or maybe it should go to a museum in punjab india or pakistani side so that those people can benefit from the revenues it generates rather than the already wealthy uk so long as colonizers are making money off of our history and artifacts while the majority of indians pakis and afghans live in poverty people will be salty
3031	1	thats a shame you can change things now
3032	1	its definitely the army thing oh well its what i want there isnt any way they will influence my future my life not theirs sorry youre sick proud of you for being on 247 standby my sis is on the same boat keep doing what youre doing you got this here if you want company
3033	1	i am canadian american pakistani and i never heard of it but i think the more educated the family is the more they distances themselves from superstitious stuff i know a bunch of indian families that are superstitious af and make these homemade remedies for their children all the time its more of a south asian thing than just pakistani thing
3034	1	wow i didnt know there was a pageill have to check it out
3035	1	or maybe we need to stop with the help and see how they deal with that situation that would force them to try to improve their life situation instead of relying on welfare and food stamps like many do today
3036	1	your first hand experience is anecdotal at best so it seems disrespectful to dismiss someone else is experience
3037	1	i didnt argue that he was pedo so that is not relevant to my original comment even if he changed his racist ideas later in life he still engaged in other problematic behaviors which included exploiting women he had power over that alone is justification for considering him a problematic figure
3038	1	gt quran in sanskrit that is some nextlevel misinformed
3039	1	thanks yes im referring to the traditionspractices over the religion itself ill reach out to my family to get started it is just a vast topic and would be nice to have something to read as well

3048	1	my family would be against me marrying anyone straight from south asia two potential reasons although i dont know for sure first is they know im american and would clash culturally there are different expectations in a relationship for people from the there versus here just like there would be between any cultures secondly if the person is educated there and doesnt have a solid career path here than my parents would say no they know i would never live there and if that person isnt financially stable and able to provide for a family than it is not worth it also pakistani credentials arent as valuable in america if he had some  qualifications or definitely job prospect in america  different story  that being said thus is all pure speculation on my part either way desi guys whether abcds or fobs dont typically go for me so it is moot
3049	1	weirdo to another weirdo lol

3072	1	east asian racism against south asians has always been strong and will only increase unlessuntil india can become on par with at least china so like not for 30 years bare minimum its only in us and canada that there is some solidarity thanks to some idea of shared struggle and cultural similarity

3085	1	im not criticizing hindutvas just interpreting their discounting of the aryan migration theory  india is a large country in a central location it has experienced waves of migration and invasion all of which have impacted indian culture and identity recent dna evidence at least implies some sort of migration from the iran area whether or not the dravidians were invaded and pushed down south i havent seen any evidence that points in that direction

3099	1	isnt it also hypocritical to critique recent invasions when most likely the critic is present by virtue of an earlier invasion
3100	1	there is nothing wrong with being religious there is something wrong when you force your religion down someone is throat when you force women to wear a hijab when they refuse again i know plenty of women who proudly wear the hijab but it should be a choice or when you belive that men are superior to women or that men should have 4 wives or that your son should inherit more than your daughter or that gays and apostates should be killedand it is not cuckholding your self to western ideology plenty of christians and orthodox jews have similarly bad extremist views
3101	1	this is my mother though she whips up food pretty quickly theres a lot of prep work involved and she still makes things the old fashioned way like soaking daal overnight and then putting it in the pressure cookeretc her time being a housewife an watching her cool and clean most of the day actually caused major resentment issues as a kid but then i learned how much sacrifice she was doing for our family but even now at nearly 65 she wants to do it her way and my dad and the kids help her a lot but when all the kids are home it can take her up to an hour to clean and thats after we have helped with other forms of cleanup she has a special way she washes her pots and likes to clean the kitchen a certain way that we are not allowed to participate in also my dad has started cooking too but when he cooks the food is amazing but somehow masala ends up everywhere including the ceiling it drives her bonkers

3111	1	wrong goris do sleep with me quite regulary in fact the issue however is that because of the inaccurate stereotypes indians are at a disadvantage not only with women but in social interactions in general and in movies and entertainment this led to us being typecast in movies and also many people refuse to invest in india or travel there because of public perception this wouldnt even be a big deal to me if it werent such an extreme hypocrisy in how people judge indians compared to other minorites
3112	1	eh he was waiting at a speed trap so im not so sure about that
3113	1	i have an aunt who has lived in the us for around 25 years or so she truly belives that  homosexuality is a western concept and that it does not exist in india we even had a distant cousin in india divorce her husband because she caught him in bed with another guy but nooooo it happened because all the people in india are watching too much western shows and losing their indian culture haha the mental gymnastics is mind boggling

3125	1	firstly congrats to you on your soontobe marriage and for managing to get it past your fam lol i agree with you that a lot of it stems from how muslim communities see girls in a possessive patriarchal way although were not alone in this as a sidenote it always makes me sad how older generations from the other communities seem to view ismailis as nonmuslims or heretics hopefully this is something that changes with us younger people

3219	1	when i say liberal i mean liberal in that a culture favors the rights of individuals and is able to move away from traditional ideas when they prevent the exercise of free will when you have sudras and untouchables who were severely restricted in society and the fact that the caste system allowed for minimal social mobility hindu society can not be said to have been liberal by any modern standard maybe compared to feudal europe it was a liberal society sure hindus were accepting of homosexuality and homosexual acts but so were ancient greek civilizations and i wouldnt consider them to be liberal by modern standards either i guess it is all relative though

3225	1	that is probably one thing i wish most of our parents would understand most of us would probably do the right thing if they placed their trust in us and ive noticed a lot of desi kids act out as soon as they get a taste of freedom because of the very restrictions placed on them from a young age not to mention the controlling nature of their relationship can get toxic really fasti know ive had to deal w my parents in a similar manner to the point the relationship ends up being toxic
3226	1	tell that to the gatekeepers on this sub

3238	1	there are some tamils in the uk

3240	1	never i dont even use mint toothpaste that is how much i hate mint
3241	1	wow i feel like youve read my mind lol i feel exactly the same  it is like living here with just my immediate family doesnt give me the same sense of familial belonging that i experience when im in india surrounded by cousins and whatnot it kind of sucks that even if i did decide to move back to india it would be after i graduate by which time my cousins will be living their own lives too it makes me sad to think that im never going to have actually grown up with them can i ask do you still feel the same way do you ever feel like moving back now or are you happy in the states
3242	1	that is not neoliberalism try again
3243	1	havent you learned that muslims arent real desis honestly there are people here who will write entire paragraphs of why muslims are all foreigners but still grant the term honorary desi to white people who converted to hinduism

3249	1	did she convert for marriage if so you dont have a leg to stand on her family is wrong for threatening you but you are not exactly helping your case if your wife converted
3250	1	i already said the neoliberal was the wrong label in another comment nexti am antiimperialist russia is not a paradigm of human rights and neither is assad just because they are fighting isis this line of thinking is akin to saying the bush should be absolved of their war crimes and obama is drone strikes were just simply because they arent trumprussia isnt fighting terrorists they are maintaining power for a despot who let these terrorists out of jail and uses chemical weapons on civilians or terrorists as deluded people like you call them

3258	1	very true im a  nownri mom with young kids and my parents raised me pretty much like op is parents are raising her way back in the 80s and 90s in suburban india they basically had two rules 1 no bad grades 2 no rudeness and entitlement  i dont know what their opinions on premarital sex were because we never discussed it lol but i met my first and only boyfriend after moving out of home so it was no longer in the faintest realm of their business when this became a point i mean they always kept saying   if you want to date we have no problems it is good to find your own partner ever since i went to college so i guess that was encouragement enough
3259	1	hurray im not alone
3260	1	dude what is up with the not being able to cut your nails at night thingi had the same thing told to me by my mom but never given a proper explanation why
3261	1	gtethnically than a north indian and south indian mandepends on what you mean by ethnicity i feel that traditions cultural history language beliefs ancestry etc would be far more shared between a north indian hindu with a south indian hindu than a pakistani as there are pilgrimage sites that both the north and south frequent and therefore increase bond with each other making a closer ethnic bondfor example in the case of ancestry you have at the major pilgrimage sites pandits that record ancestral people that have visited the site the most prominent of which is haridwar which perhaps unconfirmed has the largest list of ancestry in the world of both north and south hindus as that is where many hindus go to to submerge the ashes of their deceased relatives
3262	1	yup i kind of stumbled upon an article when i was wiki surfing its pretty bad stuff
3263	1	gt ts a pretty agreed upon idea that groups of friends that consist of exclusively abcds are to be avoided at all costs im thinking of the types of desis who were involved heavily in the undergrad south asian student associationsreally abcds to me are more of the white gangsta wannabes
3264	1	damn this is so true i grew up believing that the worst day in their lives is often times still better than the best day in the lives of many indian kids
3265	1	oh it definitely is that i posted an article on why laws on islamophobia in the uk can be easily misconstrued here and on exmuslim and it got removed yet an article on modi is india for some reason is still active it is also the same users time and again sanahere posted a thread on how people should be banned if they were in a hate subreddit and should not talk about politics in the subcontinent and it got locked because people were fighting on that there

3267	1	i totally get that  but maybe a counselor could help you let go of that feeling of control or figure out how to distance yourself from the problems in their marriage  ultimately you cant solve it for them but you can have a loving relationship with your parents outside of their marital issues
3268	1	this aint it chief most hindus eat meat because they are not hardcore religious and because cultures and scriptures change
3269	1	you can try it if you visit any desi locale most of them have it like on gerrard st in gto or devon st in chicago granted it is not as good as someone making it but still better than regular chai

3275	1	gt that is all fair but that is what i meant when parallel societies shouldnt be createdthen we have no disagreement people shouldnt have to assimilate and integrate law of the land is what everybody despite their views and beliefs has to follow gt i think my freedom of belief as a fundamental basic right should come before any integration to larger pakistani societyi think im right on the money about you not being an exmuslim or a pakistani but ill treat you as if you were one for nowalso nice sidelining of the issue i asked whether you should be forced assimilate and integrate into the pakistani culture values  and worldview  gt those people shouldnt be allowed in the first placeif that is one of the key things important for a host country they should definitely not import foreign labor and allow them to live in close proximity to one another gt but if they are here they should be educated or forced to accept the values of the societyjust as exmuslims and other minorities in pakistan should be forced to accept the values of the society is this really a good position for you to hold lol gt it is a problem when those communities dont give their members freedom to do what they wantplenty of sikhs and hindus are going through this even the tamest of cases of parents forbidding their children to do xyz are found right here on this subreddit
3276	1	no but then again i havent posted anything yet
3277	1	gt is desi geographical or is it cultural if it is cultural then a muslim in india has far more shared cultural similarities than they do with an arabic muslim if it is purely geographical then 2nd gen indian shouldnt be considered desisit is a mix desi refers to the diaspora i disagree with the fact that 2nd gens should not be desisgt where do you want hindus to go where can hindus of the world call home as a culture religion and philosophy and point towards as their spiritual centeri never said hindus cannot call the subcontinent a center there are thai hindus and indonesian hindus would you consider them desi as well would you consider richard gere and other buddhists to be desi is mahershala ali and ahmadi also desi considering the fact that their spiritual center is in rabwah and qadianmy spiritual and religious center is makkah and medina does that automatically make me not desi there are desi catholics whose spiritual center is located rome and the vatican are they not desi as welli simply disagree with the fact that gabbard being hindu automatically makes her desi it doesnt make her any less of a hindu though nor does it disqualify her from calling india her spiritual center

3280	1	i remember like 4 days ago there was some 42 year old mumbaian saying all pakistanis secretly support terrorist attacks and it had like 10 upvoted before it got taken down mods really should ban anyone with bakchodi or its pakistani equivalent in their post history all the flame wars in this sub really bring down its quality imo and as someone who isnt religious either way neither side has the moral high ground
3281	1	hows it my fault that you make lame irrelevant comments that get massively downvoted i was making an observation youre taking this personally and its frankly hilarious

3291	1	hyderabad is quite interesting in that regard i took a 2 week programming course once during one of my summer vacations and everyone in that class except for the teacher hindu or muslim spoke and knew only telugu it was quite tragic for me but then you will find a good amount of people who can only speak hindiurdu i think it depends on where you go in the city

3319	1	nope there is only caution against all meat and specific restrictions on beef because of cultural reasonsmy grandpa is a pretty religious hindu and would regularly hunt wild boar in his youththe main reason pork is hard to come buy is that there are many muslim butchers in india even nonmuslim butchers dont sell pork as to avoid losing muslim clientele
3320	1	meh ive seen his type before  they take offense at anything that remotely makes hindu indians look bad and on the other hand never miss an opportunity to take a shot at christians or muslims  it is a type of inferiority complex you cannot avoid these guys on the internet

3353	1	i totally agree with you in case youre interested in reading up on this subject ruth vanita has written a lot about same sex love in india is history i think she and various other scholars have really demonstrated that homosexuality was not as taboo historically in india as it is often treated now it makes no sense why people would cling to homophobia but they do i honestly cant imagine a productive or meaningful conversation with my parents about same sex or queer relationships because that homophobia seems so ingrained in them
3354	1	and unlike the british the muslims and mughals are an integral part of this society a linguistics scholar said that the very name shah is persian amit shah made himself a crusader of this causewhy just go 400 years why not all the way back to 4000 years and consider the bearers of ani gene make up and their culture as an outside influence it is a dangerous game and nothing good comes out of it think of it this way the more the science progresses the more we will know about our genetic differences the oldest inhabitant of this subcontinent has no claims over it treat the muslims like they are a part of this cultureindians are not the same people it is a plethora of cultures races religions and languages that has to respect and work with each other

3466	1	ive been following this bill for a few years it primarily benefits people stuck in the backlog from india and china although the green card backlog has gotten traction as a human rights issue in other circles too it is been introduced multiple times before and has always stalled out most recently it was introduced by a california republican in a district with a large immigrant populationthere are at least three different bills that address the backlog sitting in legislative purgatory without much movement one version is less favorable to business and one version is much more favorable for green card waitlisters but also tacks on a lot of other immigration stuff pretty much all legislators support one variation on the bill but have not been able to come to a consensushr 392 is the middleoftheroad bill and if the republicans put any sort of effort behind it it is very likely it will get passed but it is been sitting around without a whiff of action for years

3469	1	yes i do live in india and i am thinking of doing my phd and postdoctorate after my ug in the us and will return to india after that how does that change anything you still havent given any valid data or rebuttals to my arguments there is a reason why the elite indian universities the indian institutes of technology or iits provide the highest number of graduate students who go on to become engineering professors in top 50 us universities and not their own universities like mit stanford or harvard herehttpcsbrownedupeopleapapoutsfaculty_datasethtml is the source a database maintained by brown university this is the case even if the combined intake of the top 5 iits has been less than that of a single us university for most of their existence there is also a reason why iit graduates end up skewing the bell curve a bit too much to the right in mit graduate programs and end up at the top there iits are only known for their ug programs by the way not for higher studies there is also a reason why indian immigrants have a higher income when compared to american born indians according to thishttpwwwpewsocialtrendsorgfactsheetasianamericansindiansintheus data by pew research center there is a reason why almost all indian ceos of large tech companies are indian born  it is because they dont waste their time in this dating nonsense during their prime age regarding me not being able to attract women you dont have to worry about that either my male friends compliment me all the time about how great i look even the most soughtafter girls used to hit on me during high school despite the conservative environment but i rejected them because i had to prepare for one of the toughest entrance exams in the world with a selection rate of around 03 for upper caste students it is people who blame and cry about their race who are the ones rejected not the ones who are proud about it because women hate insecure men besides ive heard that people get more matches once they change their location settings to western countries like canada on tinder when compared to india probably because india is more conservative but i do admit that it is hearsay and not statistically measuredgtalso you believe there is less sexual abuse in india than in america or australia which again is laughable and further devalues your opinionsit is not a belief but a fact backed up by un is dedicated survey data which accounts for unreported and spousal abuse cases how is your opinion right and an organization which has spent years and hundreds of thousands of dollars in carrying out their survey their methodology is mentioned in the second page of the report wrong besides is it really surprising to think that white people who according to the international child sexual abuse database maintained by interpol form about 788 of visible offenders also abuse women more herehttpwwwecpatorgwpcontentuploads201803towardsaglobalindicatoronunidentifiedvictimsinchildsexualexploitationmaterialsummaryreportpdf is that reportregardless weve digressed a lot and it is because youve derailed the conversation like i said before please dont reply to me unless you have some solid arguments and data backing you up and only talk about the topic at handedit you seem to have added a few things ill address them one by onegti literally used the rating from the app store found in all android or iphone devicesit is not really famous as a mobile app especially on ios it has 35k reviews on android and its rating is 39 it has 30 million registered users and 70 million installs according to them compared to 50 million registered users on tinder as of 2015gtyou know nothing about columbia youve never been there and dont know anyone who goes there your analysis of theyre too focused on studying and dont take care of themselves is again laughablei dont have to be there for that it is a well known fact that other than jewish people asians almost always end up being the valedictorians and honour students there especially in stem courses examplehttpsengineeringcolumbiaedunewsvaledictoriansalutatorian2018 for 2018 it doesnt look like they go to the gym or spend too much time grooming their hair as seen in their full body pics in other websites because they are busy in studying and doing the right thinggtof course i can pick apart how you incorrectly analyzed the study but ill just leave it hereplease dogti just looked it up and firstmer is literally an app designed for people 35their official website and app says that it is designed for adults there is a separate website called firstmet senior dating for older people and other sections like over 40 to attract that age range too that doesnt mean it was meant to attract only older people they wanted all demographics older generations do not use dating apps as much as younger generations but even if we do assume that the majority in that poll were 35 wouldnt that make the younger generations even more liberal especially because the older british people looked down on indians

3497	1	yes i agree that a market economy is generally better than state controlled economies it is just amusing to me when capitalism is pitched as the saving grace to many of its own problems especially the problem of inevitable wealth accumulation in the hands of a tiny group of peopledont get me wrong there is nothing wrong with being rich especially when that wealth is earned but trust fund babies dont earn that wealth they inherit it capitalism is a meritocracy for the first generation but inheritance kills that meritocracy quicklyalso the ussr and nk two of the most repressive regimes to ever exist are bad examples of true marxist ideology and they certainly dont characterize socdem regimes with socialistlike tendencies like the nordic countries canada etc
3498	1	about the same i try to stay away from shaving because it always causes bleeding and cuts

3501	1	you have to account for population density minorities were once scattered now theyre more condensed in neighborhoods with those alike to them my point was that you wont see black people in park slope anymore because theyre moving to places like bushwick where theres also a high black population even though that number is slipping the black folks who can afford to leave tend to move down south but thats the older generation usually
3502	1	nothing predates prakritwow do you even agree with origins of homo sapiens cos if you did you know the first known settlements in sumeria and egypt had written scripts for the language they spoke the first emperor ever  sargon the great rules over akkadia and his library had clay tablets that indicate who paid what and how much this was 4000 years ago and you have the clay tablet to prove that the only thing that sanskrit  prakrit has that puts it as the oldest language is our own glorious veda fantasy there is no anthropological  archaeological evidence to suggest thatedit httpsenmwikipediaorgwikilist_of_languages_by_first_written_accounts

3504	1	the article surprisingly doesnt give quotes that represent his changing thoughts and prejudices it just says they did
3505	1	is that cause you struggled with giving up cheeseburgers
3506	1	gtall conflicts start somewhere but very rarely do they get resolved based on only when and how they started but understanding the root cause of the conflicts helps address moral superiority one side may claim today
3507	1	go to the coasts it is very much the same thing hereampx200bfremont and sunnyvale ca is very much the same way except the indians there are more south indian and wealthy
3508	1	im not quite sure what you mean by the us has a right to be a christian nation americans have a right to change their constitution it would legalize awful discrimination but culturally speaking the us is a christian nation why is the weekend on saturday and sunday instead of friday and saturday why was there a scopes monkey trialwhy is there a national prayer breakfast  why did hrc lol talk about how her favorite book was the bible ultimately there is no divine guarantee of pluralism its a conscious effort separation of church and state is a philosophy not a legal guarantee the state only needs to guarantee legal non discrimination

3513	1	what did you expect from the hindu
3514	1	check the wire article linked below
3515	1	it is not anti india but it is extremely partisan i do highly recommend going through indiadiscussionsi got banned simply for calling out censorship on a thread of a new redditor wondering why rindia was so biased

3524	1	im not saying anyone is superior to anyone else stop reaching
3525	1	i def agree with you on this i really believe the solution is just to stop bringing up the issue if it is not going to result in anything new every single time there is an argument it is the same lines over and over she inevitably ends up bawling in her room and my parents give her the silent treatment for the next x days until she goes back to med schoolhere is the typical scene play by play mom in a bad mood cause she is thinking about it brings it up completely out of the blue everyone groans argument happens with the same 10 lines repeated i dont feel comfortable it is my life i want you to be a part of this i cant accept this it is different when it comes to my kids im not trying to disobey you i just want you to accept me for who i am why should i change for you why cant you even listen and change a little for me and leave your horizons open to looking for nice brown guys i dont have anything against indians it is just that im already with a guy if this doesnt work out then ill be open youre the one not being open itll always work out as long as im alive cause you dont listen to me etc etc etc it is so dumbit is mainly that she is really emotional and im really cold so i unfortunately cant empathize with her strugglesemotional issues so i end up just getting really annoyed all the time by her constant need to resolve her two worlds i realize that it is an issue on my part that im not able to empathize as well
3526	1	is your family shia muslim

3536	1	my indian friend is two children are mixed race  the white looking son has a very indian name and the indian complexion son has a very irish name  i like to think when people hear the white son is name they know he has indian heritage and when they hear the indian looking son is name they know he has irish heritage
3537	1	im typing from a tablet so cant check atmbut probably a pakistani film as there are two pakistani actors just the word jatt and not jutt threw me out
3538	1	how are things now usually kids from those type of families become super americanized more so if they were allowed to have friends in the first place
3539	1	halal is an arabic word that means permissible water is halal oranges are halal milk is halal etc
3540	1	im not specifically focusing on brown residents im aware of the diversity as i had many punjabi tamil gujarati etc friends growing up all along my street i would just like to let my kids and i experience the type of ethnic diversity that i experienced growing up while still being assimilated into the greater american culture i would feel the same if i had to live in a majority white black or hispanic neighborhood
3541	1	no i think you only feel that way bc you give that number too power im 30 and i dont feel 30 at all in my mind im still 18 still have a lot more to learn and probably going to change my career in 2 years it is never too late

3544	1	click the link above not the same fedex express doesnt control the other divisions like fedex ground the way google ceo controls most of alphabet
3545	1	bruh i agree with most of your points except the restaurant thing the indian restaurants being run by non indians was first started before pakistan existed and has been grandfathered in it is also a marketing thing for ignorant white peoplealso alot of people emigrated before pakistan was a thing so are they indian or pakistani and india almost has as many muslims as pakistan has people 3rd largest muslim population in the world infact are they not indian too so you shouldnt write them off as muslims being killed when it is also indian muslims being killed i know alot of people who are proud indians and proud muslims but then they face islamophobia in the west and violence in india and dont identify with pakistan so where would they feel accepted
3546	1	you can research this yourself most khalistanis do not even live in india or pakistan and have been a mostly diasporaonly thing for a while now
3547	1	not as bad as east asian girls i really feel bad for east asian men
3548	1	dont listen to this guy ask them out asap no point waiting around
3549	1	have you been through every desi posts and rasianparentstories and questioned why they wish their parents were white does the mention of abuse not ti you off to what the problem might be
3550	1	i couldnt have said it better
3551	1	this might be a deviation to abel from the biblical times
3552	1	all of these comebacks are trying way too hard people making these insults are immature and insecure so just hit them back in the simplest way possiblesmells like ftsi dont condone homophobia at all but this word is the best sucker punch for these types of white teenage fucks also helps if you hit the gym and they happen to be scrawny
3553	1	one of the most if not the most discriminated against its fact
3554	1	thats because of stereotypes asians in general have it bad due to this bad media image the average black dude still doesnt do well in dating but they have less stigma against them than we do
3555	1	i used to have white girls come up to me in middle school and call me kevin g
3556	1	thats dope man i legitly never see this opinion from pakistani people on here
3557	1	in most cases i would probably agree with you but this guy has a point reading the ops post i also got the sense that he is blowing this into something bigger than it really is he comes across like someone who has been really sheltered from substance use much less substance abuse and that is not uncommon among indian people growing up sheltered i also agree that he comes across a bit like an aunty who sees someone having a few drinks and thinks they have a problem just the fact that he is so shocked his friends way younger who he obviously barely knows has some issues tells you a lot about this guy
3558	1	she hasnt embraced the noiwhere is the source for the jewish progressive one i would seriously like a sourcenevertheless i am not a fan of sarsour overall i disagree with her more than i agree however she isnt antisemitic more than antizionist and most people tend to conflate the 2
3559	1	not in this interview you trumptards probably will ignore it though
3560	1	that is a great point punching up so now i understand why whites were never mad when dave chappelle is in whiteface making fun of whites thanks
3561	1	if he is such a good guy why doesnt he call out his fans on the racial attacks
3562	1	islam he is talking about islam do i get a cookie for getting it right
3563	1	desis are more bark than bite whites and arabs took millions of slaves
3564	1	can you elaborate on what you mean by community building its really hard to have community when your poor in my experience in canada
3565	1	what an ignorant thing to say if you completely buy what either party is selling you are brainwashed and dont even know it
3566	1	she is 18 years old you little twat you probably troll on reddit for similar reasonsgt sadisticyou should understand the definition of words before using them so you dont sound like an idiot
3567	1	the first day or so is always super hard after youve done it for a couple of days your ability to thinkenergy levels shoot up at least they did for mei try to eat dinner by 730 and then fast till lunch the next day i always drink coffee every morning and a ton of water until lunch which helps to keep away hunger at this point hearing the stomach growls motivates me even more lol i like to think of it as my stomach encouraging me to hold out for another hour or two instead of a cry for help
3568	1	til that being transdesi is a possibility lol
3569	1	gt roots in dharmic philosophythis was a really cool comment had no idea that there was a connection there thanks
3570	1	that is not my perception
3571	1	this is the only opinion in this thread that matters
3572	1	nothing humiliating in learning something new
3573	1	thank you for posting this  i listened to his whole interview by ezra and basically ezra called him out every time he said something crazy and he just pivoted the conversion somewhere else each time  i think honestly all these old white dudes dont think about power dynamics and how the status quo is literally killing people  they are angry that they cant say slurs about people that they didnt grow up around and want the same civility from their childhood 50s and 60si have to deal with this shit on a daily basis in my work and it is unbelievable to me how social justice got misinterpreted to be about feelings rather than life or death by old white liberals
3574	1	i dont really post much in this sub these days but i logged in just to tell you how much i love this commentim 31 a girl im on the asexual spectrum and i have a past history of sexual traumaabuse these last 2 are important probably because they explain a lot why i was never actively trying to date  im currently in my first relationship ever an open one but even when i was single i was happy  also i do not want kids so it is not like i was ever in a rush to make babies or whatever  every time id try to talk to my mom before about why i wasnt interested in partnering up with someone she wouldnt even listen to my side of the story  it was just no you must get married and have children it is necessary  and when i first told her of any shitty assault things that happened to me her response to me was that marriage would help me instead of therapymy parents havent met my partner yet but they are stressed the fuck out to the point where my mom has put up a shaadicom profile of me behind my back  lol  things are so bad at times that i actively avoid my own family but my happiness is important to me above all else  i know it is probably really shitty but every time my mom gets on my case now over the phone i tell her to mind her own business and get some new hobbies to pass the timeedit i just wanted to add that i really love my mom  she may not know or understand certain things about my life and i do not appreciate certain things she pushes on me but i still care for her very much and i know she loves me too
3575	1	well idk what you have been through unless its some real serious stuff i dont see why she would be a hypocrite i am sorry but i have a negative bias towards people that really hate their parents that they plan to run away and cut their contact completely my opinion on them would plummet a lot unless they have a really good justification there are a lot of other ways to go about for a lot of problems
3576	1	why should he if he was born in india or born to indians he has every right to stay in india similar to every other indian instead of doing this why wouldnt you ask him for his reasons for that conclusion
3577	1	gt we didnt partake in any of the haram activitieswhat are those
3578	1	gambling and alcohol i suppose
3579	1	i know some filipino ameican sibblings named first names arizona he is from arizona and america your is is worse though
3580	1	everyone wants a better life and britain has a lot of opportunities hence why they like britain it isnt that complicated
3581	1	literally all this subreddit does is talk about the negatives same with any indian activist page on instasocial media you just have a bias and with your previous replies dont believe there is pride in being indian
3582	1	came from unhappy abusive parents who did mot divorce they blame each other all the time we as kids were forced to choose who side to take on which argument we kids wanted a divorce or atleast be sent to boarding school but some dreams never come true such parents dont have time for you the time they have they spend it fighting and blaming each other other than that it fucks your mindset about relationship and marriages i think people with divorced parents are better if they live separately and get to live with whoever they want and the parents act like mature adults i know there are terrible divorce where they hate each other  blame each other and turn the kid against other parent i am saying good divorce is better than staying with unhappy parents i am saying this from the perspective of kids
3583	1	thank you
3584	1	what happened with rdj
3585	1	seriously ive been saying this for months and nothing happens got a reply once saying it wouldnt work at most
3586	1	yep they do but doing very well in the uk as well and its not only that other factors come into play
3587	1	gt wearing something like the bindi as fashion is obviously offensive since it has religious connotations but wearing just regular south asian clothes by itself who gives a shit they dont define you id rather people show interest and curiosity then treat us like criminalsbecause when we wear them we get pelted with racial tirades and get told to go back to our own country why should ehite people have the freedom to wear them and turn around and be racist shitbags towards us
3588	1	bruv that is a really weird analogy
3589	1	having open supporters of khalistanis at gurudwaras and having them demand a referendum seems significantly more than a might
3590	1	damn thats harsh
3591	1	gt nothing just as long as its not at the expense of or putting down other religionsbut why is it assumed that pro hindu automatically means putting other religions down  the same isnt assumed for any other religion
3592	1	agreed browsing this sub kinda bums me out by making me realize that there are some pretty sad pathetic people out there that share a lot of the background i have
3593	1	i have a rabbit they dont eat their own faeces they have two kinds one is the actual poop which they sniff and pass on the other is a first pass dropping which contains mostly chewed up hay which they eat again to gain all nutrients most goats are herded and eat grass  maybe in urban areas they eat whatever they can find i wouldnt eat anything unless it is off an actual farm farm raised goats vs farm raised pigs pigs are still fed anything at least where i am
3594	1	go for it is she in north americaim in a relationship that is 10k miles16k kilometers apart and i still reminisce meeting my so for the first time at the airport
3595	1	found the fellow 9year old getting a little worried there
3596	1	yes the early buddhists and hindus went out in to southeast asia hence the reason that hinduism is practiced in those areas despite not being in the subcontinent hinduism is strong in places such as java in indonesia and thailandthe entire history of humanity has been movement migration and invasion the difference is how the invaders interacted with the indigenous peoples some assimilated some integrated some made a completely new culture by mixing and some completely wiped them out
3597	1	exactly tribalism all ready divided and fucked up south asia why do we have to spill that shit over to the us too
3598	1	surprising people on rindia find indian people thin skinned for calling out that song as racist lol

3600	1	you listed oklahoma twice
3601	1	he is done the same for russian slavic as well as japanese culture oh yeah and american too
3602	1	i dont see how that piece explains anything what exactly did it fill in for youi went into the piece to see if he said anything truly offensive since the it is hard enough to black without being gay is damn near the opposite andnothinall the writer of that piece said was that a lot of his jokes bombed which we already know and nimish talks about in the articlenot really a good reason for cutting someone is mic and that she decided he was blatantly antiblack because he had a joke about how asians were totally overshadowed by black people in the oscar thing from a couple years back might not be the most pc thing to say but it is hardly racist article doesnt spill any tea it is basically just the writer talking about how she didnt find his act funny and how she found it offensiveproviding afterthefact justification for him being booted off we already knew the crowd wasnt really finding his set funny
3603	1	lol settle down lil man
3604	1	and their marriage was quite abrupt
3605	1	ditto us racism
3606	1	yeah protestants and sometimes easternsyriaccoptic orthodox christians have always seemed stricter
3607	1	well i like moving countries so im not really fussed about moving i would like to think that i would move countries a few times before settling downhowever i think that you make a good point that we would have to discuss this
3608	1	yes remove toxic people from your life itll do wonders
3609	1	that is a very well written comment with so many word plays good job
3610	1	sorry if this may sound ignorant but does a child born to a mother with cancer have a higher risk of getting cancer because of the inherited genes
3611	1	lol too funny
3612	1	sure and btw  moustaches are giving way to gotees
3613	1	yeah on vkcom you can easily find rusiann dubbed bollywood movies

3615	1	do you have other friends in that country just in case this girl is psychotic or you dont click well in real lifeid say hanging out with her on your first visit for more than a weekend is too much anyway unless you have friends there to escape to maybe take a day off work check rlongdistance or rwemetonline for stories like yours they arent uncommon
3616	1	jon snow over here
3617	1	yooooooo you didnt have to do him like that
3618	1	not to be sexist but women are better with languages in my experience eirher way youre lucky to have a partner who wants to learn for you give her a big kiss
3619	1	what butthurt you are just being a typical patriarchal misogynist your need to constantly bring up the purity of muslim women as opposed to nonmuslims in terms of sex really does come out in your posts gt i was simply sharing a fact which bothered you guys so much maybe those muslim girls are just unwilling to have sex with you wink wink everybody here has stories that disprove your idealized incel fantasy heck we know that premarital sex is a big thing in many muslim countries  iran for instance why would it be different
3620	1	i do not know the complete story so cannot say if it was just a comment or something else but that is a unthoughtful comment i know friends who would bring balochistan to explain whatever is happening in kashmir is justified having said that i feel sorry for a loss as i can read in your words
3621	1	now date a shitty white guy well see if you apply the same to all cumskins
3622	1	i want to go to there
3623	1	lmao there are people who actually earnestly believe that black people are a protected class and cant handle any jokes or criticismmy sides
3624	1	pmao keep thinking that
3625	1	yes and they always inevitably end up in my plate
3626	1	right that is why we need stronger physician education into pain management because asking patients to rate their pain on a scale from 110 is outdated and there are far better ways to measure subjective pain the bigger issue is the disproportionality between pain and prescribed pain medication regardless of patient scaling dentistry for example is the biggest offender of all people go in to get their wisdom teeth out where the pain usually lasts 13 days and are given a month supply of opioids that is just ridiculous even this article highlights an actual certified physician not knowing the consequences of prescribing someone percocet after the patient odd on tylenol
3627	1	yes it works of course the assertion is that it is not ethical not that it is not effective he is arguing that totalitarian regimes deplatformed progressive beliefs so progressives should not deplatform other beliefs who gets to pick who is voice does or does not get to be heard
3628	1	but you know sometimes feeling proud of anything makes you prone to be proud of anything you know sometimes you need a bit of anxiety of insecurity of a little bit of fire in order to get things going otherwise youll be left being proud of something that is nothing to be proud of and ultimately stagnate idk thats just how i look at things maybe im too hard on myself
3629	1	le euphoric anglophilic bootlickers  this is a clue for me that you are a complete single digit iq drooling idiot moron imbecile of course that goes without saying if youre a theist tell the magic fairies in the sky that youre mad at me lmao euphoric is a meaningless insult only hurled when you are mad that you are wrong and the other person is right also you dont get to be the judge of who is and who isnt indian ya fucking cunt and you go on to prove it further if you actually bother to read the article youd see that is its just one example of nonbelief in indian culture let is look at another one insteadcharvaka iast cārvāka originally known as lokāyata and bṛhaspatya is the ancient school of indian materialism1 charvaka holds direct perception empiricism and conditional inference as proper sources of knowledge embraces philosophical skepticism and rejects vedas vedic ritualism and supernaturalism23456a httpsenwikipediaorgwikicharvakainteresting so in other words there have been atheists in india for thousands of yearsatheism is simply the lack of belief in a god or gods it is a big tent that includes several different philosophical views  it does not imply materialism by any means there are atheist materialists but that doesnt mean all athiests are materialists and that they all subscribe to your narrow view your strawman card has failed and you can appropriate my balls
3630	1	gtthough not sure how theyll learn punjabi since my man doesnt speak it fluently to begin withyour kids can still learn punjabi even if your so doesnt speak it so dont see how that would matter and if they personally want to dont force it on them though with languages there are resources to learn most languages nowadays with tutors friends who are native speakers etc and if they express interest im sure you can find resources it is great to know that stuff but it is up to them what they want to take from it as they will form their own ideas when people say they are going raise their kids in their culture the question what is their culture because they growing up in a different country and will certainly adopt values in the culture of the country they are living in it is different from the culture your and your spouse grew up and again keep in mind it is not the same as yours ampx200b
3631	1	you are confusedthe documentary and the original comment above is talking about the cultural practice among a few pashtuns of sexually abusing boys this only occurs in areas where those pashtuns live whether in afghainistan or pakistan your new link is just describing annual sexualabuse statistics for children which is reported at 9 cases per day in pakistan contrast that with india which has 96 per day httpswwwbbccomnewsworldasiaindia42193533httpswwwbbccomnewsworldasiaindia42193533
3632	1	what kinda software do you write
3633	1	what are you trying to say with the shah is persian thing yeah of course it is persian cyrus the great styled himself the shahanshah of the four corners of the world like 3000 years ago no one thinks shah is in any way of indic origin it was introduced to india by turkic invaders like babur and timuri still dont consider the mughals timurids delhi sultanate etc a part of indian culture indianpakistanibangladeshi muslims yes they are desis but not the empires built by foreign conquerors of another culture the language of the mughal court was middle persian for example not even a desi language they clearly saw themselves as different from their conquered subjectsi think the indoaryans should be considered a part of desi history because they syncretised the ivc beliefs with their own religion and formed protohinduism which is an integral part of our history as the first dharmic religion not to mention their cultural and linguistic contributions to the region that religion would later syncretise with the religion of my ancestors to form the codified hinduism of the rigveda and onwards i have no problem if you want to do that tbh as im 100 tamil and therefore definitely a descendent of the protodravidian peoples and the ivc people

3635	1	i really disagree with johnathan haidts crusade against fragile college kids  most of his criticism is directed at humanities departments not teaching objective truths anymore which result in fragile kids  not explicitly stated this subtly implies that the perspectives of genderstudies africana studies asian studies etc do not fit his criteria of objectivity  and it also implies there was a magical past in which the humanities were taught in a more objective manner  it really calls into question what ought to be decided as objective truth who decides what truth is  minorityperspectives in the humanities shine light onto the gaps that a predominantly white academic discipline fails to recognize  not having these minority critiques can normalize and give academic credibility to inherently racist projects  for instance johnathan haidt endlessly defends charles murrays author of the bell curve right to speech  this sounds good on principle but should universities give credibility who argues there is a genetic basis for black and white people having different iqsthis argument assumes that race is founded on biological grounds  race in the us is political categorization  biracial individuals are usually lumped into the category in which they are not white  by arguing that there is a natural biological reason why some races perform better on a test it argues that there is no intervention that can be done to improve a communitys circumstances  charles murrays book was influential in gutting welfare programs and community development programs in the 90s and 2000s  his book can be contributed to a poor understanding of genetics but it has had material consequences in how we vilify caricatures of welfare queens and criminalization of black and brown menhaidt argues that were becoming a victim culture based on the praise and coddling victims receive especially in academia  i think this analysis fails to encompass what is occurring  i think its apparent that younger individuals are more open to discussing their vulnerabilities  we have to enter a precarious job market after burdening ourselves with thousands of dollars in debt that doesnt guarantee us the lifestyles our parents lived  i think younger people have a better recognition of the importance of mental health and have the language to discuss their problems  this is a relatively new phenomenon  their may be some negative aspects but i think this openness and push for empathy bonds people together more than johnathan haidts romanticized view of the dignity culture he lived in during his young adult life  i think his obsession with undermining entire fields of study and supporting the platforming of john birch societyacademics is indicative of what he considers objective truth to be

3639	1	i mean chemically synthesizing new drugs always come about but their half life and toxicity might be more than something mammalian based  in other words mammalian cell based therapies and medicines are coming up more and more especially for complex diseases  its just our immunology and how it works you cant have an alternative until we reach that stage of using genetic engineering on our own cells
3640	1	hell yeah that taste doesnt go away for a long ass time

3643	1	gt  i understand if some south asians dont know how to behave and you are expecting that when you are approaching us it is not some but most same as the restaurant service in the us why not accept that most dont tip and most expect service in airplanes to be at level of servents also to be fair air travel in general is stressful and policies and food provided changes all the time so for those not travelling frequently they may be unaware of the process and simple things like the fact there are not assigned storage space for your bags in overhead cabins especially if you travel in economy and if you want better service try business class or higher that jet airways staff were really courteous even to the obnoxious drunks on the plane even to this unkill who kept wanting to purchase the duty free alcohol and taste it before buying it something like that flights to india are never drama free

3653	1	ive explained the slight and variable complexion preferences of males and females as opposite and based on the effects of testosterone on skin color you claim there is some magical transcendent beauty to light skin that men and women universally admire youre just wrong why have selective factors not caused people around the world to be lightskinnedbefore you say environment consider this the san ethnic umbrella now confined mostly to southern africa tend to be very light skinned even though they live in one of the harshest desert regions in the world and are africanthe various inuit yupik and other arctic and subarctic peoples of na are decidedly brownskinned even though they live at high latitudes many mena individuals are so pale that they pass as european yet again they live in an arid hot largely desert and subdesert environment many are dark as well of course but whywe would think all ethnic groups would become as light as possible if it was truly such a desirable trait meanwhile the ethnic groups of sudan like dinka who are perhaps the most north african subsaharans with very arabized culture are nonetheless the darkest people on earth wed expect their darkness to disappear pretty quickly since egyptians are a stones toss away and can be extremely light though again to my point darker brown skin persists as the dominant complexion
3654	1	lol im white and no shit more desis have than anyone else youre indian you idiot
3655	1	wasnt that about trasngenders or something
3656	1	if a girl is interested in you she will have a reason there will be something about you that she really likes and will gravitate towards all this stuff seems nice in a shallow manner but  there are multiple directions to take this here are some generic examples that have no truth behind them or they could who knows a bodybuilder often has strict eating diets she wants pasta for dinner and chocolate mousse for dessert maybe butter chicken and rice with raita what is the guy eating a musician isnt home on many evenings she becomes the groupieultra wealthy can mean a fun lifestyle or also a very comparative materialistic lifestyle too she may have to be on her agame in mannerisms and possessions all the time what does relaxation time meansuddenly things dont seem as peachy anymore

3666	1	with all latin americans included the total goes up to 788 instead of 76 so some clearly dont identy as whites in the census as far as racial diversity goes a white latin american is the same as a spaniard living in uk right so how can you exclude the entire set when talking of latinossecondly if we ignore race and look at multiculturalism then you would need to acknowledge the whites from other countries living in the uk because someone from spain or turkey would bring their own distinct culture with them
3667	1	nope several stories fromhindu mythology allude to same sex rships and even marriages the rig vedas themselves mention it and do not condemn it

3679	1	would you ever wear it on you it didnt occur until yesterday that people wear their guns its so cool its a whole gimmick it attaches to the belt and everything its just so spectacular how people handle their guns with such care and skill my date was very smooth he showed me how to use it effortlessly i crave that effortlessness oh yes i forgot that people can buy guns illegally why would anyone
3680	1	same but they all speak telugu i dont think any of them can speak urdu thoedit are you talking about india or pakistan apparently theres one in both lol
3681	1	well my mum was raised in australia and there werent really any other indians living in her community then i also grew up in a mostly white suburb with no indiansouth asian communityi agree with you even though there werent any other indians i knew outside of my family in my head i felt a kinship towards other indians as i have gotten older and learned about the actual culture more i feel less kinship
3682	1	not to the people obsessed with indian culture but the indians themselves curry is often used as a racial thing against indians at least koreaboos and weeaboos dont have any racial connotations
3683	1	no worries from my limited experience aussie desis is a generation behind north americans north americans are seeing 3rd generation whereas australia is seeing more 2nd generation i think you would relate more easily with the future generation haha with that said it is tough to find people you may want to connect with but i know theyre around the universities are probably a good place if youre around that age
3684	1	i will say this unpopular opinion because it ties with yours and that is i hate the term desi i come from an indian family as i take pride in being indian american i enjoy what my community has done worldwide in that we are successful immigrants that everyone loves every where we introduce new things and become part of mainstream culture look at south africa look at the caribbean and you will see long lasting effects of what indian immigrants before us have donei dont like being lumped up with pakistani people because we are different countries with different people now its been that way for 70 years i am friendly towards my pakistani friends and we do have a lot in common but as seen on this sub they dont want to be associated with indians so i feel the same way about them i get kinda annoyed  when i see indian restaurants run by non indians show your culture off and be proud of it dont stay in the shade of indian americans but create your own identity i also think as a follower of dharmic religions we are only hurting us when we dont speak about our identity how many sikhs and hindus have been killed because people think they are muslims how many muslims have been killed because of islamaphobic incidents in the west its 2 different numbers when people think of muslims they think of dark skinned brown people which most indians are crazy people will come randomly but i cant think of any bigger tragedy than getting killed for something you are not
3685	1	he served in the army and he made several statements criticizing khalistanis before he became the cm they still voted him in knowing all that at the very least they dont really care about him bad mouthing the khalistanis if the khalistani movement is as important and as popular as some people here claim then he would never have won that election
3686	1	i totally hear you  why dont you make one
3687	1	isnt this how modern online dating works though kinda like a western blend to shaadicom etc
3688	1	that is something a virgin would say
3689	1	lmao sad but true was talking to my cousin and her fiance the other day about politics and they said they couldnt talk too loudly because people are more venomous when they perceive you to be talking shit
3690	1	that is kinda funny so if youre a doctor and your girlfriend is choking on something youll just have to let her die
3691	1	out of curiosity why im asking as its happening to my brother and i
3692	1	gt i can guarantee that in general an uppermiddle class black guy gets less bullshit to deal with socially than a uppermiddle class browndesi guy does im an upper class desi one of my best friends is an upper class black guy it didnt stop him from being bullied and beat up while being called a n the worst thing i was ever called was a terrorist and had a slurpie cupwe are both in grad school and no one has ever said to my face that the only reason i am there is because of affirmative action never mind the fact that he has always gotten better grades than me
3693	1	fyi he is a swede still
3694	1	the distance to the schools across the river seems deceivingly short but it is not a trivial commute especially as winter sets in bc doesnt seem to have many desis anyway also i do not mean this in an elitist way but given my field of choice i stand to make good money both now with a side consulting business and after i graduate i would prefer to date someone in a similar position who also has similar earning potential just to make sure someone doesnt mooch off of me etc
3695	1	nope as i said your example is not the norm and an extreme outlier some indians have even gotten killed because people believe they where islamic terrorists you cant really tell if a black person is muslim by just looking at them since the stereotypical look of a muslim is a browndark bearded man i have been stopped at airports for an extra security check several times and i dont even have a large beard people have told me india is a rapist country to my face etc its definitely worse to be a brown person in americawest than it is to be a black person youre simply wrong and i will only stop reinforcing stereotypes of other groups when they stop with the narrative portraying indians as creepy emasculated betas and rapists in western media things are changing for the bette though since the negative stereotypes about us has less basis for it in reality compared to the negative stereotypes for blacks
3696	1	they stick to themselves i will only talk with the women who are hot and smartwell thats a very diminutive look at our people
3697	1	engineering is getting really oversaturated imo i wish someone had told me about the whole trades thing before i went to college lol
3698	1	racist how so more than most other cities in americagetting dates hasnt been a huge issue the issue has been getting quality dates id prefer to date a girl at harvard or mit who will have a similar earning potential because i have come across girls not at those places who seem to only be interested in me because of the school name and earning potential
3699	1	aww thank you for the compliment
3700	1	very unpopular
3701	1	if you are able to smell the masala after getting into a cool enough car your clothes or hair are probably carrying the smell some countermeasures  do not cook when clothes are in same room wear different clothes for cooking do not cook with spices in the morning before you head to work dont forget spice smell also sticks to the hair biggest smell culprits are curry leaves and mustardthis is not just a problem with indian spices i dont like the smell of eggs in brunchbreakfast places and bagel shops too so i keep my coat in the car even if it is freezing cold outside
3702	1	it wasnt at mine lol
3703	1	i believe that you can totally be addicted to weed about 20 years ago very smart authorities and subjectmatterexperts said that oxycontin was only addictive 1 of the time and that it should be prescribed morehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchver78dj5hyei same way maybe weve been brainwashed into thinking that nobody in 5000 years of recorded history has anyone ever died from a cannabis overdose
3704	1	ever notice how indians who support republicans seem to be lighter skinned on a average i honestly think they are living in a different world than the rest of us maybe the republican supporters are nicer to them this is with the exception of crazies like dinesh d souza shiv who legit have a few screws loose in the head
3705	1	yes i think judging fobs is something we really do im just gonna say it having a deep indian accent will really hurt your ability to make friends with people who have been running away from stereotypes all their livesif you want to be respectful to people from india stop using shitty acronyms like fob it is not funny and very insulting and there is nothing wrong with a deep indian accent any  abcd who judges an indian for their accent  needs to be ashamed of themselves if you dont have a problem with an italian or a japanese or a mexican speaking in heavily accented english then stop being an asshole over indian english and mannerisms
3706	1	any suburbs with lots of arabs had that going well before fousey running arab game as a desi to reach abcd chad status is a staple

3716	1	if you think it is a waste of time dont participate and just enjoy the vacation but for many people it is a fun festival to share with their family friends and neighbors since a lot of offices are closed at this time people can visit their family give gifts and have fun how is it insulting to christians though every single christian whom i have told that we celebrate it as a nonreligious occasion reacted positively
3717	1	gt india has never exactly had it is act together compared to america so that is not likelyif the latest presidential election has proven anything it is that america hardly has its act together and is very susceptible to foreign influence i think collectives still have a lot more power in india as compared to the us for better and for worse

3724	1	haha that sucks p
3725	1	im sorry i misunderstood your comment to mean that op should just warn the guy that he could get reported for his behavior as if he were an indian looking out for other indians i think we might be of the same opinion

3733	1	it really is a beautiful state the land is cheap there also but still those demographics kind of imply a lot of ignorant bigoted white folks
3734	1	it doesnt take that much time at all what coffee are you using maybe some brands are better made for filter coffeeing idk but i use desi brands do this the night before add the coffee powder preferably desi brands into the top part of the desi metal percolator and fill up the remaining space with hot water by the time you wake up the next morning youll have the decoction ready in the bottom compartmentnext day morning boilheat some whole milk disclaimer i havent attempted to make filter coffee with almondcoconutwhatever milk so i dont know how it tastes with those preferably in a steel cup pour however much decoction you want with sugar and pour the heated milk in pour the mixture back and forth between the cup and whatever you heated your milk in using high arching motions  until you basically get a good amount of froth on top and viola takes a little longer 4 min tops than your regular machine but it is totally worth it

3738	1	i dont about the tribe could you direct me to a sourcei did some googlefu because i was curious too about the malik and found that they consider themselves to be of malak gotra they were originally called ghatwal during the mughal era they were given zameendaris and started calling themselves maliklordowner from arabicso even though they are hindu the last name has its origins in islamarabicit is also one of the names of god in the quran and is then almalik الملك or the king lord of the worlds in the absolute sense denoted by the definite article meaning the king of kings above all earthly rulers hence abdelmelik servant of allah the king  is an arabic male nameitthe jats in northwest india has no south asian origin

3742	1	just to add the post never even said that she is a girl either
3743	1	true i am an indian who lives in a india and when i go the us people always have misconceptions about what it is like here i mean i can only speak for cities but parents arent overbearing at all and they do give their kids a lot of freedom same goes with my parents like for example i decided to homeschool for a year and then go to boarding school in europe and my parents were completely fine and let me choose to do what i want to do
3744	1	i need to find a group like that in minneapolis  i am currently in the process of shedding any ties to christianity which was forced on me and am looking to spiritually arm myself since i dont want the soul harvesters to get to me again
3745	1	you can follow the values you like and not follow the ones you dont like you dont like everything about the country move to and as a resident of the country you have the right to criticize your criticism does not hold lesser weight because you are an immigrant i live in america i dont like the gun culture  i dont like the huge military expenditure i dont like the criminal justice system i am going to criticize it
3746	1	i loved her in the movie fire
3747	1	if you look at it more in depth than looking good you can see the points i mean gj being kashmiri and pale not trying to be offensive here but majority of desi ppl are tan and somewhat darker so the beauty standards that were brought in by colonialism have to this day directly impacted the lives of many by pointing out you can only be beautiful if you are fair ofc it is people is own decisions and preferences to do whatever they want but fact of the matter is that these products are harmful to one is skin if you want to look at the deeper meaning into tanning then there is some clarity into the ideas that darker can be beautiful but only in certain cases idk much about this topic myself but kind of ranting now ik that in the us the popularity of tanning fashion and cosmetic  isurgeries kind of stem from wanting specific parts of black culture but not necessarily accepting black people themselveslong winded but i hope the point comes across somewhat
3748	1	she is dark skinned and why bring black people into this
3749	1	gtthe product in this case is a strong manufacturing sector  unfortunately a strong manufacturing sector requires good governance education spending women is empowerment technical sophistication and logical labor laws  india has chosen avoid seriously addressing any of these and instead has pursued a marketing campaign instead  lol what im not even involved in indian politics but his make in india has brought multiple international contracts in place look it up it was even on market watchyou really think india would be the fastest growing economy if it wasnt for a good manufacturing sector you need to educate yourself on more i feel ampx200b

3756	1	no this is not the strategy for indians in the west we are a ridiculously small minority we have to form as large a group as possible to be heard i am not bending over for a white supremacist by making a distinction between me and muslims it is time to leave these divisions behind if we want progress in the west

3761	1	not the person you replied to but wording matters to be honest i dont even like the use of indian origin to describe people who didnt originate in india im guessing that at least some of the players were born in canadathere are other terms we could use such as of indian descent
3762	1	we dont know if it was a desi man it was just someone she knew when she was 16but seriously no one should ever be put in that situation and there has got to be better protection for people to feel less afraid to file charges in an abusive relationship because that step alone  reporting  is a big step

3767	1	not to mention bollywood and indian pop culture is a global phenomenon its not just confined to india but also the rest of south asia southeast asia middle east eastern europe and africa and its catching on in south america as wellive met a nigerian guy at work who is a huge shah rukh khan fan and knows more about indian movies than i do

3772	1	thisexplains everything
3773	1	yeah  i get that india does not have dialect and accent coaches like hollywood but im sure there wouldve been other choices of actors who moved to mumbai from tamilnadu and could actually do that accent without pulling it out of their ass or they couldve just used her normal hindi not sure how this idea even made it out of the first cut
3774	1	httpsthediplomatcom201509smugglingindianantiquitiesit is a serious problem in india and at least worth the consideration
3775	1	i research my doctors beforehand most doctors usually have multiple profiles with descriptions on the internet based on that i can identify if the doctor in question was raised in india or not
3776	1	theres more than one argument used heremost people are definetly outraged at people coming here illegally its only a vocal minority that are in support of them coming in that way on the basis of  the us is the reason why their countries are shiti think a lot of the problems are a result of the media spinning the narrative the majority of these immigrants are coming here to seek asylum which is legal what that entails is that they cross the border and get their name on the list for their court hearing theres definetly some that are trying to skip all that and illegally live here and they should be deported but the vast majority are asylum seekers who have to cross the border to petition their case in front of a judge the media uses both sides interchangeably to stir up ratings
3777	1	sure you can discuss but as someone who is kashmiri it is very frustrating for you to speak on behalf of people of my community you said vast majority which is not the case i am calling the kashmiri separatists as terrorists because those are the groups they belong check out the insurgency in kashmir page on wiki and tell me if any of those groups look like reasonable people they are all terrorists and are being supported by groups that attacked americans
3778	1	this is 100 spot on combine that with the fact most desi guys dont dress well or take care of themselves
3779	1	and canada is only listing the khalistani extremists as a threat not every khalistani i dont think they will start arresting anyone who ever attended a rally why is listing extremists as a threat an issue

3789	1	white worship
3790	1	it is tough because they always frame the issue as something youre doing to them and they use that framing to guilt youmake you feel selfish for resisting particularly when you actually do like your parents and want them to be happy this type of emotional blackmail is hard to balance ampx200b
3791	1	i guess i got unlucky when meeting them one girl i met was a family friend of modis
3792	1	because theyre idiots and think he personally condemned bhagat singh to death funny how some sikhs love repping bhagat singh without knowing his actual politics and stances on religion just nationalistic garbage
3793	1	i dont think i could pronounce that
3794	1	that was sarcasm my love you know i love you right
3795	1	huh interesting i feel the same way you do about midwood with jackson heights and i grew up not far from jackson heights i think its because those places in jackson heights are regular spots to me tooof course no desi food in the city in general comes close to homemade you always gotta go to an auntys place for the real good shit
3796	1	eh i think parenting matters a lot here parents need to instill selfesteem in their kids if theyre constantly berating them and telling them theyre not good enough for anything the kid like so many desi parents do the kid is gonna internalize it and itll affect his social interactions also if someone is parents dont have good social practices themselves it can rub off on the kid since were so malleable when were young
3797	1	i am not attached to the indian community neither is my mother but in la i get it all the time from white girls its like they went and took a class on how to be like an indian mother are you not lonely everyone needs someone nah i am mid twenties and still figuring out my existence dont need anyone else to complicate it
3798	1	i like how you went straight for proving the stereotype with your commentabcds are portrayed this way because there is a segment of the abcd population that thinks they are universally superior to anyone that has ever resided in india this portrayal stems from the unsavory encounters they have had with such peopleyour assumption that theyre jealous because they have it soooo much worse than we do is exactly why they portray us as douches because clearly in some cases it is warranted
3799	1	omg gulabi rose chai is the best especially with nuts on top takes forever to make and so worth it
3800	1	that is awesome about solo traveling not all girls but unfortunately youve only met those ones good luck

3802	1	like i said earlier i will take that over the deaths of humans like the other poster said being green is profitable electric cars are getting a lot of attention for example under communism how would you stop people from creating and using gasoline cars go on rcars and youll see plenty of people that love their gas cars unless you plan to genocide them too comrade
3803	1	she is obviously his mother
3804	1	im not sure why their age has anything to do with it there are many women who married younger guys
3805	1	you are not appropriating anything unless you are specifically learning those martial arts from someone who is not originally from their respective culture or someone who doesnt know the complete inns and outs of the art form including the original names and meanings of every individual movewestern yoga is slowly being stripped of its meaning into something resembling afternoon stretching than any real yoga open your eyes
3806	1	why should the bf have to convert though they love each other for who they are and forcing someone to change in order to get accepted by the parents is wrong
3807	1	so just do it what are they going to say youre becoming a lawyer how despicableif you dont mesh with medicine dont do it you will hate yourself its a very difficult field law is also difficult but youll have a more positive attitude at least youre not a stripper or drug addict youll be fine they will come around
3808	1	racial selfdeprecating humor has gotten tiring
3809	1	yes because india has no right to be cautious after literally experiencing two genocides due to their neighbor and not to mention the countless terrorist attacks and the countless ceasefire violations and the constant instigationattempting to create a hostile environment by playing on the hindumuslim divide christine fair and her body of work really does a pretty good job of describing the tension
3810	1	its like they will once or twice but after that it seems like you are bearing down on them especially when they want to primarily go to place with very few veggie options and then you are always the wet blanket
3811	1	have no idea why youre being downvoted tbh
3812	1	my mom has a bit of entitlement about being a brahmin but she said she is fine with me marrying any woman regardless of race and caste that respects indian culture of course she does not know im gay yet so thatll beinteresting to say the least ampx200b
3813	1	i usually tell white people that meat loaf doesnt smell much better and at least our food has flavor
3814	1	i didnt even know he was a star i knew of the jonas brothers from the family channel days of my youth but the only one that i really remembered specifically was joe jonas because of cake on the ocean i always assumed the other two were the irrelevant background singers if you put a gun to my head and told me to name all three a few months back i would be a very dead man
3815	1	that is weird cause one of my friends is dating an ismaili girl and i know some other sunni guys married to ismaili girls but they all had to convert and join their jamaat
3816	1	how can you call her a progressive liberal and then call her an authoritarian in the very next sentence she is one or the other but cannot be both i would say she is an authoritarian
3817	1	gtstupid study most indian americans that are successful and the highest earners in the country came from poor farming villagesokay you can celebrate the successes of the indian american community without just making stuff up like this
3818	1	this particular recipe no where it is a sorry excuse for a pav bhaji which is one of the most quintessential bombay food
3819	1	why you so triggered
3820	1	thanks im thinking of staying on this population simply because of how much people like me are actually needed in the field there are so many desis who have children with special needs in yhe us we dont actually talk about it and most people are ashaned of it there arent that many desis who do what i do and so there isnt much cultural translation of what my colleagues are trying to do and what the families expect
3821	1	gtare they out the door when they turn 18 north american lifestylemost american households ive seen will support their kids through college to the extent that they can especially with the millennial  gen z generations it seems more common for parents to support partially at least through college the expectation is more that after you get a job you do focus on moving out and starting your own life
3822	1	sorry to hear hope yours went better than mine compared to the other fixups my parents have done this was relatively mild and actually wasnt too hiccupy still it was annoying that they wouldnt listen when i told them i had doubts or ddnt like the person like listen to those signs please
3823	1	my brain short circuited after i heard that
3824	1	if it makes you feel any better i upvoted this without knowing the perpetrators ethnic background going off the name alone ill be honest in that i assumed he was whitethere is a ton of racism towards those of african descent in the indian community particularly among older desis that being said have you noticed how no one in this thread has tried to use this assault as a justification for that racismpost a similar story with the perpetrator being black and the victim being white in any of the main subreddits i guarantee you it will not be handled with the same degree of humanity so get out of here with that colonizer worshiping nonsense
3825	1	and that human shitstain dinesh dsouza
3826	1	he literally said he thought jews should die michael you still havent answered what youre doing on an asian sub when you dont have an obviously asian name
3827	1	pretty sure theyd make an exception for lifesaving care i dont know the details or specific or that particular rule just pointing out what was mentioned in the article
3828	1	and unfortunately a lot of indians are considered ugly even if they are not objectively its circular as hell vicious cycle
3829	1	i dont think they gave out citizenship to black immigrants from africa in 1950s
3830	1	the channel where people go to watch bom diggy diggy is about to overtake the channel that paid some indian guys to hold up a death to all jews sign in subscribers
3831	1	horror movies bring out the little bitch in me id be the one jumping into her arms lol
3832	1	oof im not that evil just send everything my way rum coke tequila bleach etc
3833	1	are you sure about that
3834	1	yeah its not good for most desi guys the difference between equally attractive asian south asian men and white men on online dating is huge dance teams or something like that are your best bet also get jacked
3835	1	says more about indian media than anything else lol
3836	1	ya there needs to be a culture shift in the black community
3837	1	i mean attractive people would be more inclined to put their pics up anyway the attractive ones arent complaining about how bad they have it which is what i was referencing
3838	1	damn thats so sad those types of things need to be dealt with at an early age many desis are so focused on maintaining appearances and what other others think that they are willing to put their own family second behind those in the community this is probably due to the survival of the fittest mentality thats popular in asian culture kids who cant compete intellectually are often discriminated against
3839	1	our 4th estate is better at providing sensationalismfake news used to be called masala news
3840	1	this is economic privilege not racial
3841	1	lol i think that every time i read one of his comments kinda sad that im starting to recognize his username
3842	1	akash pravesh and ravi are easy to pronounce though
3843	1	gtbut if they didnt accept it it is not my problem it is my life not theirs it is a selfrespect thingthis
3844	1	yo that is all of us already were looking for advanced advice
3845	1	in canada its a somali thing
3846	1	gt it would be if a korean person created a japanese restaurant create a korean restaurant insteadloli was just about to cite this as an example much of the sushi restaurants in the us are actually owned and run by korean check out your local sushi placeedit also vietnamese restaurants run by chinese mexican restaurants run by salvadoransguatamalans
3847	1	false we are definitely one of the most discriminated against if not the one who faces the most of it if you want to talk about historical discrimination across generations such as slavery or war on native americans then you have to compare that to what indians faced during british colonial times in india just because it didnt happen on american soil doesnt mean anything that discrimination has still affected the descendants of indians regardless where they moved afterwards i will agree that native americans had it worse historically even compared to british india but not blacks 6 million or so indians died in artificially created famines during british rule in modern times indians face more systematic and social racism than native americans or blacks dothe only thing that protects indians somewhat is our wealth but we earned that we are still tye most hated group overall you almost never hear anyone talking shit about native americans
3848	1	on my second day lol
3849	1	a few pimples whyd your doctor prescribe accurate for a few pimples the people i know whove went on it had really bad scarring
3850	1	and that is what affirmative action is supposed to help with someone who comes from a disadvantaged background is more likely to better candidate then a someone who has been spoonfed tutors and help but application of that has been super flawed because a poor chinese family from queens is going to be categorized as asian american and pretty much have the worst chance at getting into a good college
3851	1	that is incorrect she moved to ashram in the us in 1981 when she was 31
3852	1	i notice this too even within the desi community people cling with their regional crew and wont branch out to other desis like punjabis all huddling with other punjabis and malayalees being insular  which funnily enough is further divided by religion and people just clan to their religious sect and wont branch outside of thatso long for desi unity
3853	1	back in the 80s a lot of movies had raunchy scenes in them and it was tasteless raunchiness a cliche of bollywood movies back then used to be the helpless damsel gets herself surrounded by thugs the head thug says some despicable lines after which he tries to have some fun the hero comes just in time and a crazy fight scene ensues in the end the damsel in distress is saved and after much romantic tension the guy and the girl fall in love  if you watched only the hits from the 80s you will not run across this so much you had to watch the notsohit movies to see this
3854	1	im basing it partly on my own extended family who ownrun convenience storesalso i dont think there is anything for us to be ashamed about it aside from stupid stereotypes in fact i think a lot of desis who work or have worked at convenience stores are badass like a lot of immigrants they work their asses off working long hours graveyard shifts putting up with a lot of bullshit etc that should be praised not looked down upon
3855	1	michaeljacksoneatingpopcorngif
3856	1	no we havent we have had farming subsidies rent control implementation antiimmigration sentiment and protectionist policies for the past 50 years bro all of which are reprehensible to neoliberals and are crippling to the economy
3857	1	honestly lot of people are pretty damn stupidthe average doctor is gonna be way smarter than the average person and anyone who actually thinks theyre stupid is probably just bitter that they werent smart enough to get into med school
3858	1	my mother is not creative enough to come up with convoluted bs like that she just doesnt care loli do point out calves in crates when we pass by dairy farms  we live in california she is said she is felt guilty when she sees them but i suppose just not guilty enough to see herself as a perpetrator
3859	1	there are online classes and workshops plus you can learn svms pca and neural network on the job but you dont always use svm or pca or neural network it isnt mandatory to use them only depends on the dataset you dont need a degree or masters or phds to gain a position in data science people who happens to have masters and phds already have worked with matlab and on research settings and fields which involved lot of data and math problems thats why but if you already know math and have familiarity and basic understanding and keen to learn as you progress there isnt any issue during my job interview i wasnt ask to solve math problems but were asked about my approach to the problem
3860	1	it wont be humbled at all because they never actually gave a shit about any of this
3861	1	this i think the problem is just us society it is super segregated and most white people dont grow up around many non whites us society doesnt care about the rest of the world so most ppl dont care or know much about other cultures they just think us is best and then there are so many stereotypes because of the immense racist history of the country even liberal whites hear these all the time so yeah i totally agree with you that most whites are either ignorant or racist very few are decent
3862	1	much better thanks
3863	1	what do you think they should do also why make assumptions of someone who is doing something theyre presumably interested in
3864	1	bwahahaha that is why i am at costco we did take over costco lmao
3865	1	what is ur major and what year are u
3866	1	you do realize american right wingleft wing politics cant really be directly applied to indian politics even bjp is more left wing than right wing in it is economic policies
3867	1	clearly what im saying has some merit considering the responses in this thread responses like yours really just highlight what im talking about i dont care if you have respect for me why would i care what a troll account says
3868	1	i like getting in arguments what youre seeing with the hacked printers and 2 individuals spending rediculousness amounts of money to promote pewdiepie is an inside joke  if you dont watch pewdiepie or interact with his fans you wouldnt know that infact this thread with people taking it seriously is a sentiment i hadnt even considered people would have and frankly it makes the whole joke that much funnier
3869	1	yeah pakis and bangladeshis always try to lump themselves in with indians anytime it can benefit them and then later theyre all like hahaha dekha deya na gangus ct17 buhlgaye keya ro endia ro
3870	1	the us isnt a white only country
3871	1	okay but you should go to a country where there isnt any white people around lol
3872	1	similar
3873	1	youre mentally deficient
3874	1	there is no correlation and i simply dont care about perfect spelling etc when talking to an imbecile my logic is far superior to yours though
3875	1	whoa i think you need a xanax jk
3876	1	cry more weakling did your mommy forgot to give you your lolipop today
3877	1	i lived in  a very  arab immigrant town dearborn michigan this really wasnt the case
3878	1	gt you wanna talk about rape and forced conversionwell somebody should since you very clearly need someone to educate you on the realitygtyou are another bjp it piece of shit jerking off your chaiwala and your rapit cmoooh nice did you think that one up all by yourself so very imaginativeno it isnt really it is old and it is tired and it is dumbjust like you
3879	1	nah we take it to another level honestly especially some regional communities
3880	1	it is punjab is not india is
3881	1	you serious
3882	1	gti think this depends on the situation if a desi marries within their own community then theyre much more likely to pass on their language than if they marry an desi outside their community or a non desiare you referring to immigrant desis or desis brought up abroad this normally would apply to immigrants however i dont see many abcd is doing this even if they marry within the same communitygtwill arranged marriages also fade away like how it did for the chinese and japaneseampx200bi feel like arranged marriages be much lesser in india in the future too where there will be more modern marriageslove marriages plus interstate marriages will be rising a little bit well not just in india basically most countries worldwide are following the trendampx200b
3883	1	dude this is crazy that is exactly what my dad used to say to me and that id have a tough time finding a job because people would think im muslim i mean wtffampx200b
3884	1	only reason communist countries are not doing that is because their economy and productivity sucks not because they care about the environmental more do you know how many environmental disasters were caused by the ussr if anything capitalist societies can force companies to become more environmentally friendly by boycotting the harmful ones in a state owned economy there is no such recourse available
3885	1	so if you receive average service but see someone getting preferential treatment youll be a dick and not tip just because youre envious sounds like youre more hung up on the free samplers than anything there is no need to whine like a child be mature about it
3886	1	white simply cause there is so much more of them population wisethen indian followed by latina
3887	1	my experience has been even nonmuslims from india dont eat pork though i never got a specific reason as to why ive certainly never had pork at an indian restaurant or household  judging from the other comments here pork seems to be confined to certain regions
3888	1	well look who is being an ass again  stop poking your dick where it is not required
3889	1	which is bizarre to begin with because which pocket of people exists out there in viable numbers to constitute anything other than a loony fringe minority that goesoh there is mr ahmedmr singhmr pateletc he is been my neighbor for 12 years actively thinks white women are sluts because they wear short skirts and thinks white people are too accepting of gayslesbians and that they should be dropped off buildings or stoned or had something medieval done on them always talks about how his home country was spectacular and subversively implies that white people are too trusting and nice for our own good but you know what he is a good egg this post about calling them shitty people for doing a shitty thing it offends me ill fight about this here on this specific subreddit on this one site on the internet instead of looking up how to grow prize begonias today this is the hill i shall choose to die on because god bless poor mr ahmedmrsinghmr pateletc his feelings would be hurt if he read what this hateful eth trader person had to say about himthis was a pure pander post designed to make most people agree with calling it out but without an actual idea of anyone who would support it itd be like someone saying people who kick puppies are pure scum
3890	1	i did see another few snapchat stories of her laughing with and studying with the guy

3897	1	one of the goals of america is to become postracial is it not its ironic because you are downplaying the exact same hard work that asians have put in regardless of socioeconomic status maybe if we didnt have aa then minority kids wouldnt be told they got in because of their race you are warping the definition of success to be intrinsically unmeritocratic if getting into an ivy in your definition is not one of the great emblems of success then why deny the opportunity for asians to compete on fair terms
3898	1	gtbut i dont intend my kids to do that for me because i was raised in the us and will save for retirement and so forthampx200bso than that raises the questions would you contribute towards their housingschool etc or are they out the door when they turn 18 north american lifestyle

3908	1	wow mansplaining to the point of trying to describe my personalityjust eat your food and leave man youre ugly on the inside and im willing to bet on the outside too
3909	1	i understand your perspective but if you read the article youll see that their relatives are pressuring them to break up  this shows that she has support to leave him and have children with someone else if she wants to but she doesnt i agree this is likely a case of her not wanting to leave her husband because that is all she is known her entire adult life but at some point you gotta take responsibility for your actions
3910	1	as for job in ds like any job you need a resume and portfolio so i made a website that is a resume website which have my portfolio portfolio consists of projects codes and what ive done in ds anything that interests me relating to ds and data visualizationi started going to meetups to hang out with other data scientists people network i have a friend in company who is in it that knows ds people i applied for jobs got interviews then get the job i learn and self taught myself 2 months and then started applying got a job in the company that a friend works in

3916	1	your completely ignoring the importance of trends not only that but you seem to have faith that a prime minister with little economic background in a country where no one has ever finished a full term can reverse the chinese debt trap that will need a good fucking explanation
3917	1	trump wants to crack down on h1b visas hes run on a protectionist white nationalist platform that feeds off of xenophobia and racism that some in his administration are trying to limit the damage he wants to inflict does not mean theyre all good now httpsnfapcomwpcontentuploads201807h1bdenialandrfeincreasenfappolicybriefjuly2018pdf

3919	1	you might want to find a 2nd gen desi therapist to come out and do talks on some of the parental pressure issues young folks face also just some psychoed on mental health topics like depression anxiety etci have worked with youth from desi and non desi backgrounds in this capacity getting them out to attend these kinds of events was a real challenge it requires a lot of creativity and building relationships to get young people out to an event where they talk about mental health
3920	1	gthindus have such a big identity crisis over india i dont think so while on other hand muslim certainly have identity crisis who follow mainly arab culture like dress and eat like them

3927	1	churchill was genocidal gandhi said bad things about black people when he was a 20 something law student
3928	1	they dont but i at least have some first hand experience unlike the commenter who neither provided sources to her claim nor explain why she thinks her claim to be truegt that is kind of deflecting from the current issue that is caste in indian societyculture whether in india or among its diasporayou need to know what you are dealing with before you can treat it seeing caste discrimination as something that is pretty unique to india may lead you to arrive at a different solution than to treat it as an indian manifestation of a global issue if you believe that caste is what is causing the discrimination then you might think that religious conversation will work because other religions dont have caste but that does not actually work
3929	1	well it was back in 2001 so im sure rent prices are raised now
3930	1	my bad i read your answer in the wrong context of the original question i asked i had a real brain fart moment there
3931	1	yeah but as far as i know bangladeshis indian muslims hindus or upperclass pakistanis have never started countrywide pedophile gangsand the fact that saudi madrassas exist in the west is an atrocity

3933	1	my ex was half black half mexican and grew up in socal surrounded by his large mexican family still identifies primarily as black because that is how people see him being biracial can be complicated and while being a black male has a lot of hardships it is also seen as being cool
3934	1	ibm canada never asks anyone to work long hours in fact i found the work life balance was amazing when i was working there i was surprised when i worked for 3 extra hours one day and my manager emailed me next day saying i can take halfday anytime i want i think the problem with immigrants putting in extra hours is a culture issue when you work in india as a software engineer putting in extra hours is a norm because everyone is doing it and you do not want to be the first person leaving work so we do the same when we come to any western country but again that doesnt mean you are working for all those extra hours we take multiple 30 minute breaks chai sutta walk etc  15 hour lunch to add extra hours to the roster
3935	1	spot on

3937	1	good luck i need to find one of these goals too lol right now all ive got is aiming for some super competitive specialty and hoping it works out
3938	1	it is wild we can be supremely critical of the abcd treatment of fobs but the minute we mention fobs can be monstrous assholes to abcds then we have to pretend like theyre just individual actors oh you just met assholes that is allwell maybe the abcds these fobs keep complaining about are also just a few assholes fobs really want their cake and to eat it tooeveryone is bugging tho if they cant admit that the number one thing most of the well off fobs like to do is before even greeting you like a normal person look you up and down very conspicuously before they decide how theyre going to treat youive gotten that treatment from fobs everywhere from berlin to paris to london to the us in fact just got it at the bar two nights ago from some random fob id never met or said two words to before
3939	1	yes the cradle of eastern civilisation was built by the mughals in the 2nd millenium ad
3940	1	if you care about other peoples preferences then youre creepy and all women should stay away from you your problem is not a race problem its a you problem you use race as an excuse i dont feel sorry for you and no one on this sub cares either except the other losers who join you in shared self pity work on yourself and offer something to women every minute you spend blaming the girls and white guys is a minute wasted
3941	1	if they totally shaved everything i dont think so but if i saw them preshave i think id be turned off a lot by it

3945	1	what dont tell me what im doing your comments show me how far removed you are from intelligence let op respond or not i still would like to know what he considered alcoholism geeze youre annoying af
3946	1	i agree with this i have zero sympathy for this behavior it is not a cultural thing he is just an assholealso when did it become our abcd minority etc problem to deal with this stuff if someone is in a foreign country working shouldnt they be situationally aware of how to behave in the workplacepeople get too many passes my parents and grandparents did not get passes in a white workplaces when they moved to the us why do we have to bend over backwards to help someone adjust to work especially when we wasnt included in the damn hiring process
3947	1	i dont want it to be a point of discussion every time since the major thing i do with my friends is go out to eat might as well surround myself with people of similar dietary choices and preferences this way i dont feel they are accommodating for me and i am in a semi rural place
3948	1	curryaboos sounds a little offensive compared to the other designations

3950	1	sitar before guitar lol
3951	1	that is the only possible way this would happen in the next 50 years
3952	1	india is less racially diverse than western countries  it is wellknown that india is one of the most racist countries in the world and that is a result of indian culture  if india had more diversity in the 1960s i guarantee that racial tensions would exist and probably be on par with the tensions in western countriesbut that is not actually relevant  the caste system is extremely oppressive  i dont think comparing it to segregation is appropriate though  it is worth noting that affirmative action programs exist for victims of both the indian caste system and the american segregation system  so india itself acknowledges how severely the caste system has disenfranchised its victimsit is very hard for me to believe that western women faced a harder time in the 1960s than indian women  western women certainly are better off than indian women now  if the former statement is true isnt that a fault in india is culture  that indian women have gained much less than western womenim not saying other cultures are amazing  im saying that i have more justification to critique indian culture than other cultures that have not affected me as personally  ampx200b
3953	1	holy shit
3954	1	totally disagree first fob refers to a different group of people that are born in india and go to another country is it a shitty term yes i think that the term abcds refers to a different sub population of indians and it makes all of us that have been born in the us sound like confused idiots who are out of touch with their culture and cant find themselves yes there are people who are like that but that transcends cultures and ethnicity
3955	1	aw that does suck my parents did that too but i always chocked it up to them growing up in whats basically a gender segregated society i do think these skills can be picked up with time its probably a hit to some peoples confidence levels in the mean time tho
3956	1	the issue is that there are a number of abusive practices that are accepted in the desi community at large especially among the older generations herea big chunk of desi families would consider severe corporal punishment and were talking things more than a light spank an acceptable choice even if they dont actively do it themselves of something like forced marriage  it is a minority of families that do it but the majority of families are willing to tolerate even welcome families that do itan example would be my second cousin who was married off at 16 to a dude in his late 20s sure she is not the norm but the parents are in good standing with my family the desi community and muslim community i would argue that we should have social norms so that that is not the casethis seems to be a norm among even educated and urbane desis whereas for white people it is generally the poor uneducated sector
3957	1	this is an article about a woman coming to terms with her life and the most upvoted comment is about her physical appearance why cant you liberals stop objectifying women dont we have enough sexualization of women sad
3958	1	fuck off with labels like coconut that shit is bigoted
3959	1	i know its kinda sad how screwed over some of those guys were ive read a lot of posts in that sub over the years i think it started out with a great purpose and basically went downhill after rincels was banned and those users flocked to that sub
3960	1	i care
3961	1	maybe not the most conventional advice but if you make more femalemale friends just broadly they may be able to introduce you to someone a lot of people meet their sos that way actually
3962	1	we should meet up in a nonromantic relationship type of way
3963	1	dude said the nword on twitch he may not be a racist but he is surely racially insensitive enough to question his character
3964	1	aamir khan was going to do it but he dropped i think they need to cast a unknown actori just find alia miscast in a lot of the roles she plays but she tends to get the best roles in an industry that does not tend to have a lot of good roles for women because karan johar is pretty much managing her at this point
3965	1	since the early days missionaries have pushed the myth that thomas one of jesus disciples came to the southern part of india to spread the gospel
3966	1	will have to check those out thank you
3967	1	hmm the indian clubsdance teamsetc and such i am not a huge fan of but i have not completely written them off one problem is i am in grad school and also i am not naturally outgoing so i would just feel kind of awkward i also dont really have an indian friend to join these things with in order to make me feel less awkward about it esp in grad school although yea i probably could pull of an undergrad look since im only like a year out
3968	1	gt nice sourceindia today is one of india is most prominent magazines it isnt some run of the mill newsletter
3969	1	gt its definitely not a word used positively in most situations and that needs to change reappropriating it is the first step

3971	1	any particular suburbs you recommend i was under the impression that philly was relatively cheap to rent
3972	1	you can have your opinions but reality cares very little about them
3973	1	i grew up with it i really like it but personally i prefer an aeropress it is basically percolated coffee so the difference is the coffee bean if you can mix up some arabica beans with roasted chicory in a 91 ratio that is as close to the blend in south india as youll get
3974	1	yeah i second this but any major city will have traffic new york is waaaay worse than chicago theres always something to do in the city across different neighborhoods  wrigley lincoln park logan square river north living in the city during the summers is the best some people complain about the cta but honestly its not bad ive spent a summer in new york for an internship and while it was fun new york is way too dirty
3975	1	that explains why they failed
3976	1	i guess bc he married me
3977	1	no we know you herb
3978	1	youre never really gonna be considers a real british personin the uk when i was 13 years old i was telling two white male school friends that because of my ethnicity i could only be considered british never english  they adamantly insisted that i wasnt british they said that i was english  they werent trying to negate my indianess but they were resolute in their belief that i was englishyou can argue i will never be considered english but i am 100 british  yes the likes of tommy robinson think otherwise but he can kiss my ass  i get what youre saying about america being a land of immigrants but there are some americans who will never see abcdesis as americans
3979	1	speaking of indian stores patel brothers is huge therebut it is kinda far from miami proper there is a significant indian population in orlando though
3980	1	build the barbwired electrified fence just doesnt have the ring of build the wall
3981	1	gthas she changed her stance or habitsno not at all but she is more accepting of mine when i visit she try is to have vegan food ready for megti hope that at least a few of them can channel that discomfort into changethat is my hope as well lol i once told a friend if it makes you uncomfortable maybe you should think about why it does and she lost it on me gtfully vegan since maybe julythat is awesome im not quite there yet but hopefully soon ampx200b
3982	1	agreed but he is a good storyteller and definitely has made girls swoon far more than other desi celebs so hes great representation maybe riz ahmed is a bit more attractive but hes far lighter than most desis so hasan can rep a bit better
3983	1	gtmy accent was mocked cause i talk with well an american accentnope never happens in india people like american accent i strongly believe you are not being real about your experience in india i think you were unlucky or you may have displayed superiority patronizing attitude towards other kids behavior very common among abcds who move to india
3984	1	we should drop the confused part of the abcd im ok with american born desi
3985	1	we will not eliminate violence but a decrease in religious fervor would certainly result in a decrease in homophobia specifically abrahamic religions slutshaming transphobia and a myriad other toxic behaviours
3986	1	hey man i just wanna call you out and say you are better with dosa than idiliy
3987	1	gt mcallister is the estranged son of union city calif police chief darryl mcallister
3988	1	many indian americans take pride in a form of indian culture that is misrepresented and purposely neglects the bad parts of indian culturemany racists discriminate against indians using a form of indian culture that is misrepresented and purposely neglects the good parts of indian cultureboth are issues the latter situation is worse than the former and is more important to fix  but i think as a community we can fix the former situation more easily
3989	1	money can be an issue in old age but loneliness is much worse  it is a mental strain and the the parents end up having to live alone and wait to die
3990	1	yes that is why im on this sub it is for the south asian diaspora
3991	1	gt  she is very appreciative that she has 2nd gen parentsshe is very appreciative she has parents who understands parenting it has nothing to do with what generation they are from my dad moved to america in his early 50s i never had any restrictions whatsoever yea i still dont drink alcohol in front of him coz he hates alcohol because of how bad it is for health  so i had more freedom from someone had spent 50 years in india than people here who has had parents living here for 2030 years
3992	1	gt pro hinduwhat is wrong with this
3993	1	im confident that for each anectode you can always find an opposite anecdotal narrative i have now found the opposite anecdotal narrative to my own life experience in americaim still curious to find out how whitewashed the person who posted that comment considered themself to be
3994	1	chai is a little overrated but the other two i strongly disagree with
3995	1	different person lol that is the white guy who filmed the dead body in the suicide forest pewdiepie is the white guy who dropped the nbomb while streaming a video game
3996	1	calculus is a pre req for biology degrees which most students entering medical school have
3997	1	i would argue that skin bleaching is harmful but the south asian ideal of light skin doesnt have to do with race it is more about americans projecting their complicated history on to different culturedesi people want light skin and whie people have light skin desi people want light skin because it is supposedly more attractive it doesnt mean wanting to become a full fledged white european or saying that indian culture is bad if anything south asians keep their culture very well and are proud of it so it is not like we are saying that traditional european or american culture is superior
3998	1	ayyyyyyy wallahi bro
3999	1	especially when they use syria and iraq as examplescountries the west deliberately destabilized and they have the galls to turn around and blame the locals reminds me of the big brother who grabs his younger brother is arm and starts hitting him with it while going why do you keep hitting yourselfbesides it is as if they took 2 examples to make a blanket statement for almost 2 billion people in multiple countries around the world
4000	1	this is spot on i need to tell my parents this so they break out of their shell a bit
4001	1	it used to be more like little india then it became more like little pakistan and now it is a weird mix of little bangladesh and little pakistan w india sprinkled here and therestill a fantastic area and the food is amazing
4002	1	im not implying that colonialism itself was the root cause but it definitely put more of an emphasis on ityou can even disregard colonialism in that case and look at the effects of colorism in general in desi history
4003	1	gt  i have this weird little fear that my first choice might not think of me as their first choice so when i bring up the what are we question i am sort of paranoid that me broaching the topic would force them to choose between me who is definitely interested and another girl who they like more but hasnt explicitly stated their interest in an exclusive or at least official relationshipi mean so what if it does and it forces the guy to explicitly choose someone other than you then that uncertainty is at least gone and you can move on
4004	1	opensubtitlesorg is cancersubscene is better source deafhardofhearing person here

4009	1	russia wants brexit to happen they hate a united europe or a united states of america they want to create chaos
4010	1	dont forget libya  despite it being ruled by a dictatorship it had a functioning government and one of the highest human development indexes in that part of the world free healthcare and education are just two examples  not to mention libya under gaddafi was a buffer against the flood of subsaharan migrants going into europe italy is migrant crisis started after france uk and the us decided to take out his regime
4011	1	better late than never for every 1 person of the opposite gender you like try to make 5 platonic friends of the opposite gender you are going to have to go out of the way there are going to be risks like people thinking youre into them when youre not and viceversa but it is all a part of life and youll learn the hard way good luck
4012	1	so that is the diet side cool thanks for the infowhat about exercise was it just lifting or did you do other stuff to give yourself a greater caloric budget and did you use techniques like intermittent fasting or anything or just straight calorie reduction
4013	1	gt the community is a different story  the whole thing is a pissing contest no one is actually religious but wants to appear religious to others it is actually what drove me to atheism yearssame people trying to one up each other in how religious they were was a big reason i was turned off from it too people who acted more religious got better job promotionsthat plus the fact that no one actually seemed to be religious for themselves it was all due to peerfamily pressure which imo goes against the personal relationship with xyz diety
4014	1	this makes it even worse absolutely no etiquette they shouldnt have invited him then or like the rest of us just grin and bear through it ive been through plenty of these of type of events where i dont agree with a speaker or get really bored you just sit through it its extremely rude to cut the mike like that its offensively rude like what the fuck did their parents teach themthe only justification for cutting a mike ive seen is when this comedian was stupid to heckle the comedians who went before him and then they cut his mike when he went on it has be really bad to cut the mike like touting really bad shit like jews deserve to die this isnt even remotely close
4015	1	dude the guy you are responding to is a 14 year old dont engage lol he just trolls on this sub a lot he is definitely not kashmiri either
4016	1	because the indian community is too busy judging each other by how brown they are establishing bullshit superiority complexes believing that lighter skin is win trying to undercut each other in the workplace etc
4017	1	i dont know the requirements in the indian military but there probably is a educational divide between noncommissioned ranks and cos

4022	1	that is a really good way to think of it i guess if i did fall into all that it would have led me into something that i wouldve regretted overall im happy with my life so far but it is just i wish i had some crazy experiences that i could look back on

4025	1	integral do we think briyani is our favorite food is taj mahal our national monument did akbar and other mughal emperors gave room for hindu customs does our hindustan music have any qawwali influence
4026	1	its the fucking system that has objectified women and made their worth so disposable i like what this comedian said i find good men talking about bad men incredibly irritating and this is something the good men are doing a lot of at the moment gadsby said not this moment not this minute because the good men dont have to wake up early for their opportunity to monologue their hot take on misogyny they get primetime tv and the late showsshe joked about turning on the television each night to find anywhere up to 12 jimmys in the midst of monologues about misogyny and how other men should just stop being creepy  as if thats the problemmen who reject the humanity of a woman that wasnt creepiness gadsby insisted it is misogynymy problem is that according to the jimmys there are only two types of bad men theres the harvey weinsteinbill cosby types who are so utterly horrible that they might as well be different species to the jimmys gadsby saidand then there are the fojs the friends of jimmys these are apparently good men who simply misread the rules garden variety consent dyslexics they have the rule book but they just skimmed it you knowwe need to talk about how men will draw a different line for every different occasion  a line for the locker room a line for when their wives mothers daughters and sisters are watching another line for when theyre drunk and fratting another line for nondisclosure a line for friends and a line for foes gadsby saidguess what happens when only good men get to draw that line this world gadsby said a world full of good men who do very bad things and still believe in their heart of hearts that they are good men because they have not crossed the line because they moved the line for their own good women should be in control of that line no question
4027	1	the fact that india has 1 billion people is why 5 is a really high number india is idea of poverty is also significantly worse than what it is here
4028	1	what fast food jobs pay that much i heard most fast food employees there live off of tips gt you will never be poor here unless you fall ill which is what i was mainly getting at
4029	1	gt weird because i never once said no u yet this is the second time you bring it up instead of acknowledging my argument run out of things to sayyoure literally responding back with every thing ive said to you im only highlighting this simple fact because this is nothing more than no u maybe think up your own responses instead of copying what ive already directed at you lol gt nobodys lashing out on you youre the one who attacked me first and now all of the sudden im the bad guy you dont have the caliber to be a supposed bad guy if i was being honest but you are lashing out you did make an entirely new post whining like a loser gt youre a narcissist i explained everything to you and youre struggling to put your points together yet still want to just to be right dont  me againthere you go that is something coming from you quite refreshing if you ask me your explanations amount to i didnt want to spend an extra dollar or why must i become a vegetarian outside the house these are shit responses mate gt dont  me againare you saying i should lol  u again lol
4030	1	check out the director is new movie  tumbbad beautiful visuals  the visual aesthetic is more korean than hollywood which is super refreshing
4031	1	this goes beyond superficial labels like skin color my friend speaks telugu and dated nontelugu but still desibrown guys who werent that interested in learning the language or culture and restricting her pool to only telugu guys made it harder to find someone she ended up marrying a german guy who has actually made efforts to learn a lot about her culture and can understand telugu to some extent now with how vastly different south asian ethnic groups can be if you cant find someone in your own ethnic group which is especially hard for the smaller groups it can be almost the same as being with someone who isnt south asian at all
4032	1	the british crown jewels werent public property either but they are considered so now nizam is jewels were also not public property but they are now saying that they were not public property at the time when they were gifted is a flimsy excuse they were financed with public money and in the case of kohinoor it was also mined in india
4033	1	ranbir kapoor is the actor is name he is great
4034	1	yeah but this is mostly the baying born of ignorance metoo works in the us because in the us punching up is not hazardous to your health try it in a country that doesnt have the resources to properly enforce laws and you will disappearbut if you think youre indian but youve spent your entire life in edison or fremont this will be lost on you
4035	1	museums loan artifacts from other museums and they pay for the loan so if britain wants to show the kohinoor diamond they can pay the indian government to have the diamond on loan  but britain wont ever give up the diamond let alone pay a lenders fee to show the artifact
4036	1	i didnt know that interesting i will read about itbut again linear b was cracked by using modern greek if my memory serves right rosetta stone was rather interesting as it was greek written in egyptian hieroglyphics i may have this one mixed upits not unusual that a present day language is used to decrypt an ancient dead language if anything it is only logicali will read about what you said i will be happy if sanskrit does turn out to be older than what i think it is
4037	1	gt 3 desis tend to be very demanding iirc according to a survey indians are probably one of the wordt tourists in the world again it traces back to how most middle and upper class desis see people in the service industry and expect to be waited on hand and footi get that especially when dining at a full service restaurant but i never heard about desis throwing a fit or complaining as much about service at olive garden and such restaurants it is as if bad services is excused at olive garden but hell breaks loose if the server didnt smile or refill my water at an indian restaurant and yeah this is purely anecdotal and reading yelp reviews by other indians for indian restaurants was curious what were observations and experiences of others
4038	1	i dont understand what youre trying to say hereampx200byou say 10 is expensive but which nonfastfood restaurant can you go out to eat for less a buffet is usually cheaper than ordering a la carte so what exactly is your complaint
4039	1	what exactly is her experience that i am dismissing she didnt claim that her circle is limited to a single caste she didnt claim that people regularly ask her for her last name nor did she claim that she has seen it being done she didnt claim that she was discriminated due to her casteshe wrote a statement as if it was the truth and i am disputing it because she neither provided a source nor did she provide any personal experience that might support itgt even in the us in the desi social circles in college grad school and the professional world a lot of people discreetly ask about caste if it isnt obvious from last name and subtly observe caste lines there arent that many intercaste friendships or relationships especially ones where it is more than one level apartand fyi there is another person below who is saying what i said that inter caste friendships arent rare ignore op what is your experience do you not have any friends from other castes how many people have you seen that stick to exclusively their caste when it comes to friendships
4040	1	yup everyone knows doctors are stupid right
4041	1	ive encountered similar scenarios too some fobs just assume abcds dont know hindiurdu i default to english anytime i see a desi person that is around my age but that doesnt mean i cant speak urdu

4049	1	you shouldnt be taking any blows especially over stuff like this your parents getting physical with you is a lack of self control on their part they should be better at this by now i would just do it over the phone if it gets bad just hang up and try again later if they start to manipulate youguilt you hang up if they threaten suicide call them on their bluff and alert the cops this is not the time to yield to their emotions keep in mind that youre just informing them of your decision dont come at it like youre asking them for permission cause youre not
4050	1	no prob i went from being a c and sql programmer to being a system administrator initially i worked on maintaining servers and sharepoint as an application now i look after our office 365 and azure tennantsone thing they dont really teach you in university is that it is a biiiig industry there are a lot of different roles you could be a programmer you could also be a tester network admin database admin application admin business intelligence engineer business analyst even a project manager many of these roles never touch code or do it very lightly but theyre all vital to the industryalso you have a lot of different work cultures some places are well managed you work hard and youre rewarded well some places are toxic management is abusive and everyone throws each other under the bus then you have really laid back companies that dont pay you that well but you have a great work life balanceultimately you have to find the culture that fits you and the role that you enjoy doing you could even specialize in specific business focused applications like xero hr or salesforce or acanex information and document management or crm or whatever people will really appreciate the help

4053	1	its as naive to think that trump started racism in this country as it is to think he is separate from it or doesnt share those values
4054	1	wow you must think youre better than us s but for real i totally agree in my family there was a big issue with who my cousin was marrying this person i guess was from a lesser caste whatever that means theyre now happily married and her husband is a very good person there shouldnt have been any issue thankfully my parents dont believe in caste nonsense one regard theyre progressive in
4055	1	im definitely not a caste system apologist but even within gujaratis there are slight cultural differences among different castes eg the way rituals are done dietary preferences gender roles etc these differences may have been more prominent in our grandparents time so i understand where some of the older generation is coming from however i agree that these differences are negligible now especially in the diaspora
4056	1	theyre both the scam artistspriyanka is on the way down literally hasnt had a big project for years and is ageing heavily
4057	1	always complete at one place first you dont want to be mixing schedules and procedures because you would be timing it to the process for maximum effectivenessthree sessions are usually meant for touch ups i honestly dont know why anyone would choose three sessions that is like asking for scrappy patches then again with my condition i have to be a bit extra on everything
4058	1	nah i disagree you guys have everything our humour is different you should accept that and acknowledge the differencees that people have most americans ive met are ignorant about the world and cant see things from a global perspective  the fb group was made for aussies if you join the group know what youre in for
4059	1	nope again everything i said was fact and everything you said was wrong youre pathetic i dont need to attempt to be an alpha male i am one its nothing wrong with interracial dating regardless of gender but its wrong of hollywood to only promote indian women and asian women with white men and rarely the opposite so until they fix that its a good thing bollywood balances things out by pairing up more white women with indian men compared to the opposite you lost so get lost
4060	1	i guess there is a dominatrix craze these days
4061	1	they were a few individuals an entire community was ostracized and massacred based on the actions of a few individuals now those people are being told their community is tied with extremists because some among them might have separatist sentiments
4062	1	damn this is so true from my experiences
4063	1	its actually an unpopular opinion though one of the few here
4064	1	1 i get that those subs are either pro india or pro pakistan but is there something else about their user base that is cause for banning2 i dont think we have any mods left lol kinsho was the most active one and he ditched this sub for the sports ones
4065	1	lol this guy
4066	1	eh he has some good moments but more often than not he comes off as someone who has no real understanding of whats going on to me
4067	1	gtregardless as for residents medical schools here have ramped up class sizes and do is have flooded the market as well i dont think the need for visa sponsorship is going to be around much longer based on gme at my institutionyea but foreign medical graduates are going nowhere

4074	1	yes i am sure
4075	1	not only does it belong to tanzania it is an integral part of tanzania
4076	1	1 that was not the article im referencing mine is their magazine cover about west bengal and assam i also dont know how it matters that toi reproduced the article i can find various news outlets in the muslim world who reproduce ridiculous articles about muslims being the ones who discovered evolution before darwin or how jews control the world etc doesnt make it any less stupid when hindus do it2 i read the entire article the sources the author cites do not in any way support his propaganda that modern scientific breakthroughs were actually detailed in ancient hindu scriptures before being discovered by the west and that hindu thought significantly impacted modern scientists and their researchhinduphobia loledit i didnt want to bring this up when i first read this post so i didnt comment but after reading your comment where you lash out at people who connect the bjp with this article i had to point out they are very much connected ideologically
4077	1	yes the nonmasala red label is so popular among my family and our desi community the other is gulabi chai of course i was hoping youd know the difference and that is why you picked wagh bakri lol i only heard about wb from that random bengali uncle since i was looking for masala chai he was spot on
4078	1	gt i think it is far more unhealthy to raise a child in an unhappy marriage rather than divorcing and raising your child in separate householdsfrom your comment i can say you never had unhappy married parents or divorced parents but you read a lot of buzzfeed or 9gag and came to this conclusion because the opposite is true
4079	1	again how do you decideyou talk as if they are all having money thrown at them a lot of them are taking out loans because their parents cant afford it you are accusing me of making assumptions while doing the same yourself good bye
4080	1	no i meant that there is a girl who used to be a cgrade celebrity in india called negar khan
4081	1	that is true in australia fifty percent of them will fit in the liberal party
4082	1	yeah i agree i dont really respect desis past a certain age who are still in their self hating phase many of us have been exposed to the bad parts of our culture but blaming all your problems on all aspects of being desi isnt the answer
4083	1	hyderabadi urdu or deccan urdu specifically is a specific dialect that has dominated hyderabad through the former hyderabad state for generations its evolved from hindustani taking in various parts of other local indian languages surrounding the former territory of hyderabad state and neighboring princely statesin pakistan urdu was chosen as a lingua franca a source of muslim unity and communal identity postpartition good move tbh most post partition andhra muslims learn telugu in school and are therefore fluent those that have no need to converse in urdu may lose their proficiency over time but theres a significant population there that still speaks deccan urdu
4084	1	that is a good point i feel like the different south indian groups have many similarities with each other in terms of culture and attitudes but cant say the same for north indians tho
4085	1	fijistani hindi
4086	1	pretty much 90  of the people desi or not fail to raise their kids as moral human beings who have compassion and respect for others  worldwide our world is fucked up big time

4090	1	he did buried in st thomas mount chennai
4091	1	youre right bhaipart of me wanted to debate them but part of me realises that it is of no use
4092	1	it sounds like youve met some shitty white people and are assuming that they represent all white people so not only are you angry and bitter but youre also making blanket statements about an entire race based on one bad experience if that is not bad enough people like you get on a pedestal and then pretend to speak for all brown people everywherethere is just like so much bullshit packaged in here i fucking hate dealing and talking to people so much
4093	1	i think it often extends beyond illegal immigration my recently immigrated cousin is quite against h1b visas fearing the competition for his job i could see that sentiment especially among people in tech
4094	1	currently dating one for the last 5 years
4095	1	gt maybe in the cities in the urban centers but even there it exists to some degree it is just not on the surface or talked aboutyou really have no idea what youre talking about do you have you ever been to india

4100	1	lemme check it out over the weekend
4101	1	i still think thats a flawed argument  there are more than enough desis who werent as oppressed by whites but by other desis even more so same with other asian groups but with other asians  i dont think that alone should be justification
4102	1	of course

4104	1	i buy music off of bandcamp usually as flacc or mp3 and play it through whatever decent music player i can find on the android store currently using vlc and have no problems whatsoever with it
4105	1	i have seen a lot of people who hold the same view and criticize h1b but at the same time support diversity visas illegal immigration and are against border control the only way i can explain it is that h1b folks are competing for the same high paying jobs they want while most illegal immigrants can only get low end menial jobs they dont care about
4106	1	where was this if you dont mind me asking
4107	1	i have always tipped 20 or more never lower what i am saying is that in the future if i experience this again i will not tip cant believe how hard it is for some people to stomach that for some reason
4108	1	i think the problem was a white person holding up that sign
4109	1	im from houston as well thank god i havent met those assholesyet
4110	1	you sound angry do you also tell people no kashmiris support sucessionist agenda
4111	1	im pretty close with a lot of the kids in high school because im close to their age early 20s  i think i can get kids to come out by trying to frame these events not as indian events but like community movie night or something like that  we have a language school and it is garbage the people who run it are the same people responsible for the kids apathy towards the community ive tried to work with them before but they refuse to take input from me
4112	1	gtneed stronger physician education into pain management because asking patients to rate their pain on a scale from 110 is outdated and there are far better ways to measure subjective pain actually the most validated and widely used method is the vas  got nothin better ampx200bgt even this article highlights an actual certified physician not knowing the consequences of prescribing someone percocet after the patient odd on tylenol ampx200bthat was a med student  a medical student had written an order for percocet for a patient who had overdosed on tylenol ampx200bim not sure where youre located but opioids prescriptionover pain management is much less of a problem in canada than it is in the usa a lot of this is because docs can be docs and dont need to please admin to get their patient satisfaction up to get paid here is a good read httpswwwkevinmdcomblog201710painscalepatientsatisfactionleadsdeathhtmlhttpswwwkevinmdcomblog201710painscalepatientsatisfactionleadsdeathhtmlampx200bampx200b
4113	1	well since im gujarati and hes punjabi i would want our kids to know both languages preferably though not sure how theyll learn punjabi since my man doesnt speak it fluently to begin with i want them to know why my family celebrates diwali vs why his family does i would want them to know about the persecution of sikhs in india by hindus as well because there isnt a point in trying to hide that just learn the two cultures history
4114	1	1st gen refers to people who were born abroad and immigrated over 2nd gen is their children ie most of the people here
4115	1	colonialism and west with a perfect image has worked wondered
4116	1	seems like they have a leader and its you you have deemed yourself as  an enemy of the revolution we have our eyes on you
4117	1	im a firm believer that the circumstances of one is birth should not determine their obligations in life  this means being born a woman doesnt mean you have to raise children that being born poor doesnt mean you cant go to school or being born indian doesnt mean you have to be a doctor this goes on and on  this also means that being born british doesnt mean you have to take responsibility for the actions of your predecessors which you in no way had a hand in it is nice if you want to but by no means necessary no one asks to be born
4118	1	oh sorry i misread  i thought you said the attacker was white i was replying the attacker was black

4127	1	apparently there are httpsenwikipediaorgwikijat_people
4128	1	this sub probably doesnt think it is racist but a lot of desis online certainly did they probably didnt appreciate the fact that priyanka was the only one held responsible for this completely but nick jonas gets off the hook
4129	1	yeah his leadership career is not looking great right now they may have been better to stick with mulcair still a lot can change in the actual campaign so im reserving judgement for now
4130	1	im not im not of fan of groups trying to benefit from affirmative action   and as far as race i think america is obsessive about it now i think we need to help the poor and oppressed but honestly i think having more anti trust laws stronger unions worker co ops  better public schools would do way more than affirmative action could ever do im also tired of the stranglehold of elite colleges i want to live in a world where going to harvard doesnt matter that much and you can have just as much  opportunities for success without it im a pretty strong supporter of community colleges and that kind of thing and im really not a fan of elitism sorry rant over the desi community is filled with this thing   boeing prestigious and im just over it
4131	1	same reasoning as all white supremacists in europe right now you love these immigrants more than your own racenot so charming tbh

4136	1	gt terrorists kill anyone who oppose them with impunity and then terrorise the hindus into leaving the valleywhich came first and is that relevant to this conversation military repressions of muslim majority or the hindu minorities leaving the valley
4137	1	and probably same energy should be against american and canadian govt where abcdesis reside for crimes against iraqssyrians etc afterall abcdesis are more complicit in those crime through funding those govt through taxation

4141	1	theyd be called africans one of the main african migrant communities are called sudos sudanese indigenous australians are sometimes called abos which is deragatory as hell mainly used to belittle them
4142	1	see again i take issue like politically im going to  vote for people who want to break up big bankswant strong environmental regulations want worker coopsetc  they could be white transgendered heck a womanizer i dont really care i just care what they do policy wiseconcerning brands i rather buy ethical brands which is impossible and then i buy if i like quality of the product i do agree that i would donate to the poor people in the country of my ancestry but that isnt out of tribalism its because my family got money through the army grandpa was a government manand went to schools paid by the government and they all became doctors and engineers and then left to america so they didnt actually better the country even though the government invested in them so its because of that i feel an obligation to help the country if i can im so mediocre it doesnt really matter though i doubt i can help anyone and think it will be a miracle if i myself is just not a burden to society
4143	1	are you in that class too if so compliment her or ask for help on a pose or something
4144	1	true my cousins are currently going through this now and its been an interesting ride to say the least
4145	1	im just saying ppl like you are usually okay being in all white areas but if you are in a desi or asian area then you complain it is just part of some inner self hate imho and what difference does it make i grew up in a 60 asian american city in the us but they are all american just like if i grew up in a  60 white american city the fact is lots of self hating minorities think like you and associate american with white people and associate assimilating with getting along kissing ass really with white people to me that is garbage california is 60 nonwhite now i dont want to live around whites i dont care if i do as a majority of them are racist as evident from the fact a majority still support trump id rather live around nonwhites than whites they dont even care about school and have shit family values so give me desis any time of day at least your kids wont grow up to be retarded
4146	1	india is an insane mix of different ethnicities by your logic many northern indians are not true desi as they have significant dna from outside south asia the entire northeast of india has more in common dnawise with southeast and east asians than indians historically pashtuns were in afghanistan which had a super close relationship with india for thousands of years the mauryan empire technically controlled parts of present day afghanistan

4153	1	what i said is fact youre wrong so deal with it
4154	1	maybe because they left leaning indian americans view themselves as americans and as americans who are indian it is complicated having being a part of two different worlds it is hard to talk about it i am sure many feel the same about it as you the best way is to just asked around and get a civil discussion going
4155	1	near the beginning of his life we shouldnt use quotes from 1905 to represent the man he was in the 1930s and 40s

4169	1	you dont understand that none of the white trump supporters care about your status of a legal immigrant in their eyes every brown guy is an illegal immigrant in fact immigrants as a whole to them are bad so it doesnt make a difference if you support legal immigration they dont care about you and your legality if it was up to them theyd have every brown guy in the country deported tomorrow
4170	1	it is more fun to say what i said though
4171	1	yeah that is significantly better  pretty much sums it up actually
4172	1	is desi geographical or is it cultural if it is cultural then a muslim in india has far more shared cultural similarities than they do with an arabic muslim if it is purely geographical then 2nd gen indian shouldnt be considered desis where do you want hindus to go where can hindus of the world call home as a culture religion and philosophy and point towards as their spiritual center not all desis are hindus and but all people that believe in dharma can be desis because of a shared cultural experience due to a particular set of shared philosophies
4173	1	fob is a very racist term used to put down recent immigrants stop using it who are you to dictate what is culture for things to be considered as fobby yall dont call europeans fobs why are you using that term with indians

4180	1	how does calling out cultural appropriation imply that non hindus shouldnt practice yoga they can go ahead and practice it to their hearts desire as long as they respect the original names of the poses and the meaning behind them without altering portions of the practice to suit their commercial incentivesyou are assuming that the only recourse to cultural appropriation is to stop the use of someones culture completely which is very naïve and basic way of looking at it

4182	1	gt and isis was your timone and pumbaaiconic mindblowingfantastic
4183	1	welp
4184	1	to whomst it belongs
4185	1	gtthose countries are much older than america but their cultures have evolved in a more progressive way than indian culture hasthey evolved under very specific circumstances while part of that evolution happened before they pursued more imperialistic goals much of it did happen during their invasion and occupation of other nations as their society grew wealthier the vast majority of the populace had their basic needs met and had the luxury of devoting time and energy to social justice the nations that were being exploited did not have that luxurya simple way to look at this would be to refer to a theory of human motivation by abraham maslow ie maslow is hierarchy of needs the majority of those living in nations exploited concerned themselves with the needs described in the base of that hierarchy while imperialist nations could ponder on a society is higher needsi consider the social progress made in the nations you have mentioned to have been paid for with the blood and suffering of people from more regressive nations what is truly astonishing to me is that nations that are supposedly more socially progressive fail to clearly see the immorality of that aspect of their history
4186	1	dont restrict yourself to desi girls look for other girls

4212	1	sweets what kind of help is the idiot you are defending giving you are only posting because you are salty about living in dead suburbs lol
4213	1	yes even in gujarati folks
4214	1	yeah i dont necessarily agree with everything youre saying but youre not wrong i am lightskin and most desis in the uk are either punjabi paki guji or bengali with bengalis being the only darkskin group out of them and receiving the most abuse in terms of memes and jokes about them on social media
4215	1	i know the feeling im 25 never been in a relationship keep yourself busy with school work volunteering hobbies etc
4216	1	i meant they were of indian origin obviously
4217	1	gt my accent was mocked cause i talk with well an american accent apparently i was to blame for everything bad america didever apparently it was my fault that american troops were killing people in afghanistan or that we were involved in some other conflictomg i always fear this would happen
4218	1	i have eastern europeanbosnian and polish mostly buddies who definitely use that term to refer to new immigrants it is not just a poc thing
4219	1	so howre they dealing with your life choices now
4220	1	solid post i agree with most of this their culture is literally predicated on slavery and horrific racism yet they have the audacity to look down on the countries that their own ancestors bled dry honestly there are huge parts of modern day white america that straight up disgust me
4221	1	what language do you consider to be enough to embrace your culture i only know how to speak bengali because thats what my parents speak at home but i can barely speak hindi because my parents only speak it with nonbengali indians or pakistanis
4222	1	yup we dont talk to any extended fam anymore just me my mom and my bro and he got married but it only added my sister in law and nephew easy peasy
4223	1	unless theyre more in the vein of free market republicans and have some semblance of civility and dont have to whitewash themselves unlike the trash that is dinesh dsouza
4224	1	more like bark bark
4225	1	imo its a mistake to let the notion of gayness limit affection you feel for your friends
4226	1	bengali is both then
4227	1	youre too sensitive this coming from the guy who spams his 9000 word articles all over reddit if someone so much as breathes the word pakistan maybe some stereotypes are true and it is issues they have to deal with why do they have to drag the rest of us along with them im not saying the stereotypes are true but it is ones other desis dont have to deal with linuxnoob9 on grooming gangs
4228	1	mostly it just exposes how cringey your average indian guy is the more online you guys get the cringier you seem bobs and vagana is just the start lol
4229	1	whoa im gonna add to this though i love mint and both south and north indian food i too dislike something wildly popular i think phav bhaji is a stupid concept it is mushy like baby food why would you pair two ubiquitous starches together potatoes and bread holy blando
4230	1	loaded question but in general people with lower levels of education especially indian ones tend to believe in unfounded racial hierarchies mostly based on the premise of wealth educated people generally at least those born in developed countries this is less of an issue
4231	1	negar khan
4232	1	yeahnot enough upvotes
4233	1	hows the plot my friends are trying to look into more pakistani stuff and trying to cut down on indian dramasmovies hows the movie overall
4234	1	you sound like an uneducated prick
4235	1	in the last month what purely indian news has been posted in the abcd subreddit cite your sources
4236	1	oh fuck offif a guy likes to raphe likes to rapregardless of ethnicityhas eminem taught you nothing
4237	1	well im in the uk so im speaking from uk perspective
4238	1	its so good
4239	1	true true like i said its all relative and there arent any classical societies that would be considered liberal by modern standards afaik
4240	1	gt most of the pedophiles who get caught in uk are of pakistani descenteven that is false most convicted pedophiles are white pakistani brits are over represented in the grooming gangs rings why because its a way to make money while cutting cost of properly hiring a hooker also because people from the same race tend to flock together its the same reason other ethnicities will be over represented in certain professions groomers groom these girls and prep them for the streets to pimp them out
4241	1	dammit i missed out on this thread i would consider myself knowledgeable in this subject matter  hyderabad golkonda telugu we are multilingual as languages go telugu is the most popular one as there are many north indians and muslims in hyd hindiurdu is very popular muslims urdu speakers and gujaratis  marvadis who tend to be fluent hindi speakers run many family businesses it is always a good idea to know the lingua franca for your business this has made the city extremely multilingual another fine such example in the making is bangalore it is story is unique but there are lots of parallels
4242	1	ahahaha dude im actually fucking hopeful bunch of my indian friends and cousins still in high school are playing varsity football and other sports it is slowly becoming a thing
4243	1	lmaotrotting out chamchas to cape is a great way to put forward a point i can put up a video of a hindu christian or sikh congressperson in pakistan saying everything is good for minorities and it doesnt change the fact that it isntthe only difference is that people in pakistan actually are acknowledging that shit is bad and are striving to make things better not a sweeping it under the rug with videos like yourssorry to burst your bubble actually im not screw your bjp loving bubble
4244	1	the guy he assaulted was south asian not black
4245	1	really the only people i see get offended about all those things are white people its interesting how they get offended on behalf of all groups of people
4246	1	like maybe the solution is them changing their traditions and is not marrying your cousins
4247	1	beta only b that is acceptable is bmw s
4248	1	i very excitedly leased an audi and regret it every time people make comments on that you so rich you got an audi and from now on we will go grocery in audi etc f all that i am going to get a toyota or honda next
4249	1	still doesnt come close to the quarter million  a year you can make in your mid 20s in silicon valley
4250	1	khatris are a tribe of punjabis like jats almost all punjabi hindus and a lot of sikhs are khatris from the pakistan side theyre almost exclusively punjabi but due to some migration theres a very very tiny amount in gujarat and sindh
4251	1	lol it gets to the point that ive even seen college apps put down bharatnatyam as one of the common extracurricular activities
4252	1	not the first time remember redmans react
4253	1	agreed not trying to belittle these news outlets at alli just want wso or any other sikh organization get serious about media relations
4254	1	if youre going to be an asshole at work regardless if you came from a rich or poor background you deserve to lose your job i had a female colleague told recently to get one of the men for help the guy is now getting disciplined to the point where he will lose his job women have a hard time as it is and getting sexist comments like that can totally destroy ones confidence plus anti muslim sentiments  that is a serious issue
4255	1	oh no i definitely think his dick cheese was an issue but go off
4256	1	thanks for the feedback for our first piece we wanted to take something in pop culture prayer hands used primarily by drake and add a south asian flare to it for collection 1 we are showcasing the journey of an immigrant through clothing with designs inspired by top designers ill look into making the design larger but to be completely honest that probably wont happen because our screens are set and ready for this size and making it larger would cost us a lot again thanks for the feedback give us a follow on instagram to stay up to date
4257	1	i dont complain at work
4258	1	what do australians call subsaharan africansbtw elsewhere in the anglosphere black refers specifically to subsaharan africans we would never use black in reference to australian aborigines  thats a super confusing thing you guys do
4259	1	cant really explain i guess im just not attracted to white girls persian and middleeast chicks are fine to me and they are not really black
4260	1	caste is even stupider than racism imo as retarded as whiteonblack racism is at least they look physically different from each other the difference between a gujju brahmin and a patel is negligible caste needs to go and soon
4261	1	can confirm ujhschmidt007 gave me some feedback on my profile pictures and i met my now gf though cmb 1010 would recommend
4262	1	darkskin men have more testerone which is attractive to females aswell but darkskin men prefer pale skin women since pale skin is regarded as feminine even africanamerican men regard lightskin africanamerican women as more attractive than dark skin ones its not racism its science preferring pale skin is universalits in africa asia europe and all over the americas
4263	1	what support terrorists kill anyone who oppose them with impunity and then terrorise the hindus into leaving the valley after that people like you come here and say that the vast majority support separation who will be left to oppose if you kill and terrorise anyone who remotely opposes your agenda just this year they killed a popular news paper editor because he dared to try for peace in the kashmir valley and opposed a government attempt to resettle displaced hindus back into the valley your freedom movement lost all legitimacy when they started killing and terrorising civilians opposed to their agenda
4264	1	same the fact that im unwilling to move even when things get dire makes me appreciate my parents even more for having gone through the life changing uncomfortable and difficult move to a land where they didnt know anybody didnt speak the language had no safety net had to build their lives back from the ground up its nothing short of amazing when i think about it
4265	1	hnfdeoxyribosenucleicacids nahi hai nani ji you deceived me very much your natak levels are through the roof
4266	1	i can also
4267	1	always been part of the exmuslim community as you can probably see from my history i dont deal with trolls so have a nice day troll lol
4268	1	wait so are you saying we should consider these things foreign or not lmao by your own logic we should consider naan the mughals and islam its self foreign muslim hindu nationaliststhey exist people
4269	1	naomi scott who plays jasmine is halfindian i remember there being a whole blowup about it when they announced the cast
4270	1	do you have social anxiety
4271	1	disagree with you regardless of any difficulties or challenges they should do whatever it takes to take care of aging parents its called duty
4272	1	sis  ive published some short fiction and some essays and ive written a couple of playsone has been produced the other had a staged reading recently i have my mfa and also teach creative writing ive been working on a novel for a few years nowive had good feedback from a couple of reputable agents but it is not quite there yet and so ive revising it again another desi friend of mine is trying to breaking into screenwriting he is so close and one of the things he says is that being a doctor is great but who is going to write all those serials that auntieji watches
4273	1	yes also that my parents used to say youre different from the others and they are differentmy mom used to be very paranoid about boys i remember that starting middle school she told me if me or your dad hears something about boys we will make you see at that time i was a very weak and weird kid and got scared so muchi still think i am paying for the things i was told when i used to be a kid
4274	1	yeah honestly i already know some of them are just plain ignorant but a good ammount of them want to believe in these stereotypes about us so they can feel better about themselves so when they meet a desi dude who is better than them in every way their worldview is challenged and crushed so they try to convince themselves that we are an extreme exception to the rule which of course is laughable when it comes to girls i think some of them feel ashamed that they judged us like that when they meet someone nonstereotypical but instead of owning up to their shame and admitting they where wrong they avoid those guys so they dont have to feel shame some i guess pretend like they never had any prejudice in the first place
4275	1	i dont really follow your argument can you please elaborate if you are accusing me of being altright that is not true
4276	1	the reverse would not happen in asia because even asians assimilate to western culture rabidly
4277	1	because i was under the impression it was for all diasporic people of south asia
4278	1	hmmm i am half white but look fully indian and i dont really agree with your last statement i grew up and currently live in the us and have always felt very culturally excluded by living in predominantly white places in middle school i was bullied and called paki and even now though im an adult and am not bullied i often get hit on and asked about my ethnicity i dont mind being asked but there are certain contexts and ways to do it i dont like feeling fetishized or asked where my parents are from
4279	1	i agree with the parent dont call them goras call them vellakaran instead lungipride
4280	1	thanks lt3 i have trouble exercising now since i have bad knees after tearing both of my acls in high school but i try to go on really long walks often and they also give me that sense of accomplishment
4281	1	im guessing youre a urdu speaker in hyderabad
4282	1	as someone who is in the process i dont think people consider all that when they make the initial move speaking for myself personally i wanted to see what the great us was all about and also wanted to push myself to be away from home and fend for myself when you are young and free of obligations you can make risky moves like that the real pain and the sacrifice comes much later when you make peace with the decision that you are going to stay in the us permanently and will probably die here but by that time you have already stayed in the us for some time and are not really that unfamiliar with it anymore
4283	1	this makes a lot of sense
4284	1	yes thats true however i feel like its more likely to be frowned upon if a girl marries a guy a few years younger in the desi culture than in american culture
4285	1	fwiw islamic imperialism deserves just as much condemnation as western colonialism if not more both systems are forms of imperialism that forcibly imposed foreign cultures on indigenous states and committed unthinkably brutal atrocities with that being said the islamic rulers essentially saw themselves as indian and didnt discriminate as much based on raceon top of that their conquests were frequently just wars of submission where they would collect some tribute and leave nothing equivalent to the trillions of dollars and millions of faminerelated death caused by britain muslims certainly plundered india but they also recirculated that wealth within india itself for the most part i guess a couple rulers sent indian wealth back to iran or to central asia but they were far outnumbered by the ones who set up actual economies within india itself when they built monuments to glorify themselves these monuments and other public works still benefited the locals to a certain degree on top of that racial discrimination in muslim india was much less of a thing there were black slaves who became kings in india and attained positions of power many muslim rulers had hindu blood and essentially stopped being persianafghanturkic within a couple generationswith all this being said it annoys me that little attention is paid to islamic atrocities and that the religion is trumpeted as being a religion of peacewe wouldnt say that white supremacy is an ideology of peace islamic imperialism receives a lot less scrutiny than western imperialism which imo is unfair and incorrect
4286	1	it is a very memey facebook group that is spin off of subtle curry traits i think there is a subtle asian dating too it is a mix of joke and serious posts that are basically dating profiles
4287	1	idk who knows what but the fact remains that the chief minister is making accusations without any evidence when someone does something like that it is not a stretch to say that they are trying to manipulate public opinion
4288	1	it sucks because desi is are stuck with shitty mindset of having no reputation of stem careersampx200bat the end of the day when that hvac dude who owns his own company buys a new merc while the recent engineer grad cant find a job opinions will change
4289	1	aap mujhe pm kar li jiye muhaffez mein wapas aanay ke liye
4290	1	oh yeah do you guys have a rotting fort on top of a hill that is slowly decaying and falling apartdidnt think so
4291	1	i agree its a difficult situation but even if the bf agrees to covert the ops parents might still not approve plus the conversion can possibly lead to underlying anger and resentment in the relationship at a later time in addition the conversion would strain the bfs relationship with his own family i believe op needs to mentally prepare herself on the possibility that her family wont approve of her bf she has to decide on who she wants in her life ultimately its ops life and she should be the one to choose her life partner and not her parents
4292	1	im 24 years old i own a 3 bedroom house i own a nice car i have a good careeri frankly think i live a better life than most upper middle class uk people i make six figures in texas no income tax xdddddthe image i have is that upper middle class pepple there barely afford to own a volkswagon own a tiny condo and dont have job security
4293	1	you are allowed to hurt peoples feelings though free speech and all that so they cant really do much about it anyway
4294	1	even more surprising that any comments have to do with pakistan which has literally nothing to do with khalistani extremism
4295	1	jre 334  dr amit goswami httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxzfspk9ee_e

4297	1	one of the big issues with h1b is that you cannot be unemployed at any time you have a grace period of around 24 weeks and once that is up you will have to leave the country so annoying your employer by taking long leaves that you are entitled to carries a much higher risk my company gives me 5 weeks of leaves each year and a respectable amount of paternity leave i never use all of them because i dont want to risk being screwed in the next performance review anyway leaves are a minor annoyance the bigger issue is that you cannot start your own company cannot start your own business and you can never be unemployed so you cannot take risky jobs even though they offer better paycareer advancement opportunities netflix offers a shit ton of money but many h1bs dont go there because they do not want to risk being fired if you dont know already netflix is famous for firing people ruthlessly you cannot be ambitious and try out for a much higher position if you find out that you are out of your depth the consequences of that could be much worse than simply getting fired and worst of all your wife cannot work and has to sit at home if she cannot get a h1b herself she cannot even volunteer for any position if that position is otherwise a paid one
4298	1	that was funny comment thank you
4299	1	if india gets better then i always have the option of immigrating it is easy to get oci status if your parents are indian o course india has never exactly had it is act together compared to america so that is not likely

4315	1	i didnt say i agreed with ops post amp i actually agree with you on having solidarity with our fellow brown people esp in a nondesi audience i merely gave my anecdotal opinion since reddit is by and large driven by that if i only wanted stats amp research amp facts i have google to get me much better stats than some random on reddit lol also please stop throwing around the whatabboutism term i see it used out of context so much on reddit by your definition of whatabboutism any critique opinion or debate is a case of it like i said i just gave my personal experiencenot some defense of the op
4316	1	like i give a crap about traditions origins i have been told by hindu nationalists that i am not even a desi because im muslim me being muslim doesnt automatically make me arab persian or turk despite the fact that desi muslims have traditions from them as wellshe is a convert are all buddhists desis as well desi  hindu despite what right wing sanghis want to believe desi means of the country abd refers to diaspora a white person doesnt automatically become arab if he becomes muslim very faulty logic tbh

4320	1	idk that show feels  mostly living as a first generation american with slight infusions of his culture except for the religion episode but living his life as much western as possible needs a little bit more spice if you know what i mean to be considered truly south asian comedy
4321	1	not everyone has had our advantages though i dont know about you but my parents came here for money they werent literally fleeing for their lives from drug cartels they were also well educated  and reasonably well off if you commit a crime out of desperation shouldnt that change how you be treated

4323	1	i definetly understand this i dont experience this as much now but i did as a kidim guessing you fall into the born abroad but moved to the west as a kid camp its interesting how this works some abcds will treat you normally until they find out you were born in the homeland its like everything they know about you is overshadowed by their preconceived notions of what a native born person is supposed to be like its really unfair and we really need to get over the optics bullshit

4333	1	ive been to that neighborhood but didnt really get that impression from it plus theres a church next to the temple the only place i think i have seen an example of a close to 100 brown neighborhood is this neighborhoodhttpswwwgooglecommapsplacefriscotx7503533130556796760118714zdata3m11e34m23m11s0x864c3d86e600a1f90xaa5304264286d27b i drove through it and literally everyone walking around was brown except for one east asian couple i couldnt imagine living in a neighborhood like that

4339	1	lol tell me how im gatekeeping im not excluding anyone by saying theyre not desi i dont fit many desi stereotypes myself at allthe thing about you is youre a complete pussy youre always complaining on this sub with how much you hate desis and how you dont want people calling you white worshipping despite the fact that you come across as a spineless selfhating coward you can act as desi or white or black as you want to act i seriously dont give a fuck but telling me that i needed imperialism for my own good or that my culture is shit makes me think that you dont at the very least respect your roots i dont call desi republicans or socialists or any other group i disagree with out just because they disagree with me it is possible to be one of those things and still love your heritage the difference between them and you is your views definitely align with those of a desi that hates themselves nothing ethnocentric about it
4340	1	makeup generally is not harmful for your skin if you remove it properly by the end of the day whereas many bleaching agents are directly linked to cancer also like i said in another reply makeup isnt targeted at erasing your racial identity and being more white whereas bleaching practices reinforce the idea that one race is better than the other which is very detrimental to our progress as a society

4351	1	it was a part of it but ultimately relationships fall out due to indifference between the 2 the family was quiet open on how why they left pakistan as hindus werent as recognized when it came to jobs etc but they werent hating it its just they got a chance to migrate to canada so they did but they obviously had lot of stories and situation where they could have done betterwe were both young  27 and 22  and i guess we were immature my ex fatherinlaw was an atheist hitler loving russia lived communist and had lot of influence on her and ex broinlaws were army loving dudesi am not saying i was a saint marriage is a compromise but it wasnt meant to beone thing i have noticed common in many pakistanis that they dont seem to acknowledge the terrorist attacks of india dawood is a big deal for us i am from mumbai and lost 3 different acquaintances in 3 respective attacks  92 2006 2008  but they seem to take it very lightly once in a family conversation my ex really casually said  we should give these poor guys this dawood back  i think that moment really brought out the afterall you are a pakistani in mei have family and friends in mumbai who have pakistani wives and really no such issues

4424	1	gtit is not indentured servitude but it is not all happy either which is why some people are moving away to canada where the salaries are usually lower than the us so if someone is taking a paycut and moving to a different country leaving all their old connections here dont you think that there is something not working for them herecanada doesnt have any large tech firms remaining anymore last was rim so where exactly are these workers fleeing to canada for work at startups offices for microsoftamdintel in vancourvertoronto  the article lists some random unknown entities and glorifies them as leaders in tech sector gtwhat is unique to h1b is that you would get deported on top of getting fired getting fired is fine but getting deported is not fine for many peoplehow exactly is getting fired fine in the us the us has zero safety net have you heard about the situation of the health care in the us getting fired is significant and to dismiss it so casually again doesnt get any empathy in my opinion gtwhat is the point of mentioning that h1bs are highly compensated the resent is not because of low wages it is because they are being treated differently and crappily compared to every other nationality who is in the same position as them ie a british software engineer or a canadian software engineerhow exactly are they being treated differently and crappily  they get paid significantly well to average wages indian origin tech workers are significant portion of the tech industry and i dont see that changing anytime soon and again think about a resident from pakistanbangladeshnepalsri lanka getting deported they dont have a tech industry unlike that in india to go back to gti said people shy away from risky jobs that they would have otherwise taken because of restrictions imposed by h1bs there is a difference between not being able to take risky jobs and not changing jobsi am not aware of any restrictions on changing jobs when you are on h1b people do it all the time what restrictions are you talking about gtthe wait period in 20079 was probably 56 years it is more than 60 years now for some categories so no they are not aware of this nor could they have predicted this when they marriedi was not aware of this part it does suck then alas gtmost of them are probably illegal if you know of a legal innovative way that works for most people then i would like to hear itnope not illegal get a quick 1 year graduate course using f1 visa and then get your own h1b visas of course this requires the wife to major in skilled profession likely tech gtyou cannot simply volunteer for any position you can only volunteer for it if that position would never be a paid position ie they will never hire another paid employee for it if you dont take it that makes sense but that also means that you cannot volunteer hoping that an employer likes you enough to go to the trouble of filing a h1b for you so the bar for entry is very high for people in non tech fieldsif you are volunteering to acquire a job then yes it would be an issue if you are volunteering to genuinely volunteering your time for no pay then i dont see how this becomes an issue there are several organizations in tech centers in us where these wives and even their parents from india volunteer their time including their local libraries

4439	1	gt first generation south asians are probably the most racist and misogynistic group in americakkk neonazi altright evangelical christian should i continue it is an extremely common trope for white racists on reddit to say but what about asians when a discussion of racism comes up yes there is a problem with antiblackness in first generation immigrants sometimes but this largely stems from the consumption of antiblack white american media we still dont join hate groups we still dont physically attack other races we are no where near as racist as other groups

4507	1	of course you are entitled to your opinion yet my opinion is that public views are being manipulated into focussing on the immigrant worker rather that the employment policies of the corporation and govt labor policies the ordering of statements in your comments show it considering the short attention spans on issues including immigration i would not be surprised if people get riled up based on your first half of your statement while completely ignoring the second half i guess human emotions drive the hate towards an unknown that is a foreign worker while accept the flaws of a corporation considered their own ah well

4510	1	if your parents are hindu and religious then this is a fairly simple video in english about the lgbt community and hinduism httpsyoutube37_84wddzrc
4511	1	you wont hence you chose to deflect
4512	1	ethnonationalism is totally cool when its brown folk

4514	1	and we should get rid of statues related to indira gandhi and rajiv gandhi too progressive liberal congress prime minister indira gandhi went straight up authoritarian putting down martial law on india for a huge portion of her term while progressive liberal pm rajiv gandhi enabled and exacerbated the sri lankan civil war this gandhinehru dynasty has turned into nothing but antiheroes yet here we are with rahul gandhi as the supposed next hero of that dynasty racist pedophilia authoritarian nepotism civil war catalysts thats the best way to describe that entire dynasty sardar vallabhbhai patelhttpsenmwikipediaorgwikivallabhbhai_patel and br ambedkarhttpsenmwikipediaorgwikib_r_ambedkar were the real heroes of india
4515	1	it might be the truth i know for sure during the 60s the government used to allow only about 15 for travel purposes
4516	1	deleted  03103  what is thishttpspastebincomfcrfs94k73416
4517	1	who else hated sikhs it was progressive liberal authoritarian congress leader indira gandhi and now those progressive liberals want that descendant of an authoritarian rahul gandhi to become the next prime minister
4518	1	i am not a hindu so i am not having a victim complex i was just agreeing it is definitely a different ball game that hindus here compared to the muslims if i posted an article on how pakistani is sponsored terrorism in different regions the article would be removed and rightly so but articles regarding the indian government are stead fast here
4519	1	so you can voluntarily choose to get offended online by thinking i assumed your gender but then cant tell what sarcasm oh yeah youre a genius all right
4520	1	not really  hispanics default to white because they have no other viable classification eg they are not african or asian but instead they are an admixture of natives and spaniards  even many brown and black skinned latinos identify as white
4521	1	how is creed 2 compared to creed 1
4522	1	perhaps but the fact that people would get offended at being called another race could potentially mean that their own race is better than the one they were asked about
4523	1	this would be great but the person im giving the gift to is not very tech savvy tt
4524	1	hahashe is entitled to whatever wherever and whoever she wants to marry have an affair and sell skin whitening products i think all marriages are a charade to some degree i love the rant tho
4525	1	gt i personally hate pashtuns because they are racist against indiansmost afghans ive met tend to like indians i grew up around a lot of pathans and pakistanis wed certainly talk shit about each other but pathans arent racist in western sense of the word theyre just superficial afghanspakistanis have a north indianeurocentric standard of beauty but they wouldnt immediately assume a dark skinned desi man is unintelligent for example
4526	1	that is really messed upwhy they gotta hate us we did nothing
4527	1	sure but the first point of contact should be a psychologist eh completely different insurance billing and medical access in the us
4528	1	i mean youre the one who started with the insane nazi dnaethnicity are the same thing bullshit
4529	1	why is it bad marrying someone from india
4530	1	he can try  india got really tight on security for nationals that have pakistani ancestry after david headley
4531	1	there is plenty of area between very disappointed and with naiveity and glee if your reaction to your child is relationship or marriage is pretty much anything more negative than it is against my preferences but i can accept it if youre happy with them then youre in the wrong assuming that the reason is due to the difference in race  culture and nothing else of course
4532	1	there is a correlation between being poor and uneducated and committing sexual harrassment and since there many indians of that kind on the internet now thats why some people are encountering them at a higher rate but there is nothing about the culture or indian people itself that make them more prone to rape or sexual harrassment compared to other races but keep being in denial so you can keep bitching and moaning about nothing
4533	1	i am pointing out the different in type of help the process is unfortunately overwhelming at the beginning in terms of where to start unless it is a life threatening emergency the best place is to start with a therapist whether a phd in pyschology or mft therapist find who ever takes insurance else they can be expensive they can determine if a psychiatric evaluation is necessary which then can be routed through your primary care or if your insurance is amazing go directly to the psychiatric in private practice again very us centric method of mental health care delivery i would guess much different in canada and elsewhere where health care services are subsidized and triaged and thus appoitments may not be quickly available
4534	1	no they were a hindu tribe confessions of a thug which was propaganda literature spread that false belief
4535	1	ah yes because the title says nothing about it
4536	1	no it was far from wedding level i think they started at 400 expecting me to partake in a long back and forth but i felt utterly unequippedgreat idea about the aunty i want to know their secrets
4537	1	exactly infact people in this guys team are way too nice they actually are trying to find out if it is because of cultural difference which seems extremely ridiculous there is a basic level of decency everyone should follow no matter where they hail from i understand that this guy feels bad about reporting him amp i would too but how long should anyone tolerate such kind of attitude
4538	1	one of the complaints op of the melbourne thread had was that indian people especially men werent very accepting of her interracial relationship with a white person i thought it was similar to nick jonas position here some american lady doesnt like him marrying outside his race and nation
4539	1	gtthe pakistani state since its inception has been deeply involved in generating organizing and supporting a range of terrorist groups it first chose to rely on muja hideen as early as december 1947 when it precipitated the first kashmir war against india at that time as noted above it armed and aided mostly pashtun invaders who attacked the state of jammu and kashmir these irregular forces quickly embarked upon a reign of terror engaging in looting pillage and rapinggteven though pakistan seized only onethird of the state the countrys security establishment reached an important conclusion in the wake of this conflict it inferred that the use of proxy militant forces was an important means of augment ing pakistans organized military capabilities11 not surprisingly in the prelude to the 1965 war once again it sent in razakar volunteer infiltrators into the state with the goal of fomenting an internal rebellion however this strategy failed because the local citizenry quickly alerted indian authoritiesgtfrom december 1989 pakistan also enhanced its reliance upon islamist mili tants in kashmir after an indigenous uprising began after years of indian political malfeasance in the state13 with the outbreak of this rebellion pakistans security establishment decided that they could utilize a range of battlehardened mujahideen from the afghan war and direct them into kashmirgtmost prominent amongst these of course were the lashkaretaiba let a terrorist organization that it spawned in the 1990s and the jaishemohammed jem another that it began in the early 2000sof the two the let remains the most closely aligned with the pakistani state jem split in late 2001 with one faction turning against the state and the other remaining  loyal under the leadership of masood azhar its founder hafiz mohammed sayeed operates with complete impunity out of the groups base in the town ofgtmuridke near the city of lahore in pakistan according to informed sources let trained operatives orchestrated the swarming terrorist attack against a number of sites in bombay mumbai in november 200814 repeated diplomatic demarches from new delhi to islamabad to prosecute the perpetrators of the terrorist attack have been met with various forms of deft stonewalling from pakistanhow many terrorist attacks has the pakistani government accepted and taken responsibility of gtit should be noted that pakistans use of militant proxies in india has not been limited to islamists from the late 1970s throughout the early 1990s pakistan directed the socalled khalistani militants who were savaging indias northern state of punjab ostensibly seeking an independent state variously called sikhi stan or khalistan this is in addition to supporting a range of ethnonationalist insurgents in indias northeastthere is a whole bunch more from christine fair but this small paper from her five dangerous myths about pakistanhttpswwwresearchgatenetpublication290523463_five_dangerous_myths_about_pakistan act as a good starting point in providing some of the details of the pakistani government and how it operates otherwise her research and books are quite extensive on the region
4540	1	i agree with this and to be honest i dont think sensitivity training will be able to change this individual at all he probably has been able to get away with this kind of behaviour for a long time and is stuck in his ways otherwise he wouldnt be so casual about itif i was op id try to distance myself from this guy as much as possible for your own sake know that if you associate with this guy people could associate him and his behaviour with you and by the sound of things they already are because they came to you to ask for advice on him thinking youd have some insight on why he is the way he isid be hoping he gets fired and let it be known to other coworkers that you dont like him
4541	1	near the tail end 0810 ish i understood some of the fear but tbf i was just playing games my friends were like runescape and ms
4542	1	im so confused are you saying that a party of people from india would communicate in english what is wrong with this you do realize that english is often the common denominator of greatest proficiency for universityeducated indians from different parts of the country right
4543	1	gurjenniffer lmao that is so good
4544	1	jenniferjeet
4545	1	and to whomst does it belong
4546	1	that gotta be awkward when learning about german wwii
4547	1	isnt that a cops name in toronto
4548	1	if you like a girl why wouldnt you get her number and text her especially if you already know each other or maybe her snap name
4549	1	yolo
4550	1	hey dun hate on tb we dont have la vic is or anything out here in the midwest but yeah that is a little strange out of all the cultures that didnt develop near our own mexicanssouth americans have the most similar there is a pretty neat story about punjabis and mexicans bonding in the early 20th century might be buried somewhere on this sub either way theyre more alike us than most people id hope your friends could give this a second thought at some point
4551	1	wait is the name babber different to the name babur cause baburbaber is very common in afghanistan and amongst pathans
4552	1	haha yeah buddy just take the word of an abcd on reddit about the feelings of sikhs living in amritsar for a separate state
4553	1	haha thats how i feel most days too
4554	1	so true
4555	1	look youll be fine to make it to mes school means you got a brain now when you leave and become doctor just focus on your weaknesses when treating patients and question yourself doubting the self is the way forward you can become a good doc
4556	1	i dont think theres anything intrinsically bad about the term theres even a very popular wholesome and widely praised tv show called fresh off the boatnot all immigrants experience a difficult adjustment to western life which might include immense cultural shock a heavy preference for the values and customs of their homeland andor an overeagerness to experience western life while fobs are immigrants not all immigrants are fobs
4557	1	yup been there
4558	1	yeahi hope that happens over the next 510 years it would be great
4559	1	food for thought that pakistani american community doesnt engage in this nonsense
4560	1	wait whats wrong with indian moonshineop will be fine eating chutneys and other food lol most indian food that requires water isnt made with packaged water hell be exposed to it either way
4561	1	broke up and doing individual projects came across the main vocalist on a soundcloud track a few months ago
4562	1	yes it helps when youre lifting trivial low quality nonindustry sponsored studies to support use this shouldnt be general medical advice to people to supplement your average individual who doesnt lift but does 30 min of cv exercise doesnt need thisthis was what i implied with my original response
4563	1	dumbfuck thats fake stats when you remove self study the max differences between races is a 1
4564	1	he said that once english isnt his first language and he is known to blurt out random shit in his videos when he gets scared or frustrated although this isnt racist most of the time also he later apologised for it him also saying bob and vagene isnt racist because it is a meme
4565	1	fr when he wrapped i was like thats it
4566	1	fair enough that makes sense
4567	1	how is this racism
4568	1	right but you also proved my point  even brown people dont go out to eat indian food  even though there are usually more nondesi is at indian places it doesnt compare to the popularity of asian cuisine
4569	1	as in they dont believe in reality or theyre more like cults
4570	1	this can be said about anyone in any culture
4571	1	this is an adult party wheres the alcohol also can i not just buy ready made hot chocolate and throw in cinnemon nutmeg etc
4572	1	chutneys are cold though anything cooked or boiled is ok
4573	1	to add my 2 cents here you can have all the education you want but youre not going to earn much if you live in nk or the former ussr capitalism is the system that allows you to convert one is expertise into producing an income not to mention opening small businesses something that the indiandesi community excels at
4574	1	or they also got the joke
4575	1	so preferentially the writer would be female but translators can be anyone
4576	1	wow that is really interesting thank you for your insights
4577	1	are you fucked he is the best two way player in the league and has a winning record against lebron and durant when healthy since he is been an all star its an unpopular opinion but i think he is better than them he is definitely better than embiid and giannis who barely have any playoff success to their names
4578	1	gtoh they already are match rates are steadily on the declinelol no for imgs they are the highest they have been in 25 years httpswwwecfmgorgnews20180316imgsshowstrongperformanceinthe2018match
4579	1	yeah but that was established ages ago and if they had changed that in the movies there would have been major backlash
4580	1	you wanna talk about rape and forced conversion lolyou are so stupid you cant even come up with your own insults just say i know you are what am i you are another bjp it piece of shit jerking off your chaiwala and your rapit cmas fornstealing music adnan sami had a hit song two years ago you dolt even right now i can name you songs released last week that are pakistani chhapas but you probably are so dar up your own ass that you will deny it shithead
4581	1	what is sad
4582	1	i dont believe so is that some variant
4583	1	well i would prefer to have a girl around have no prospects currently as it is exams and havent been socializing much recently and man that girl was the whole package truly intelligent cool breathtakingly beautiful just not totally interested i guess but that can change
4584	1	they by definition are not desi also dont base your views of pashtun people on ethnic subreddits online my family has married with some pashtuns and they are lovely people just like anyone else
4585	1	because it is racism
4586	1	because it is more pervasive and bigoted
4587	1	h tine hold it dine
4588	1	i think a lot of desis dont want to delve into the darker often comical aspects of our immigrant stories im def not one of them
4589	1	no one is making excuses i clearly named more than one community but youre just upset at the fact that i mentioned yours
4590	1	i dont think there is any proof that indians who support republicans are lighter what i do think is that maybe they have lived in the country longer andor dont have familial ties to india anymore for issues like immigration some of them may feel that further indian immigration is a stifling obstacle in their path to integrate into mainstream american societymost indians are conservative in their values it is only on a few important issues do their wants align with liberals
4591	1	thank you for the ipai didnt have trouble with the name but i usually just see really vague amebased phonetic pronunciations that could be interpreted in many ways when someone tries to describe a pronunciation it is great that you went the extra mile
4592	1	i imagine having a phd from a us univ made life easy in india even in the 60s and maybe they werent self hating like most desi immigrants and actually wanted to help india develop
4593	1	hope she does a him and a video is leaked
4594	1	also a lovely point
4595	1	move on this kind of behavior is bullshit
4596	1	i have no experience in dating someone from another religion nor do i have any experience with how inter religion dating works for muslims but a lot times the topic of discussion comes up on this sub and some people adamantly defend it but i would suggest you dont  bring up conversion i would let the girl decide and the child decide on what religion he wants to follow
4597	1	wow this is literally too stupid a comment for me to even reply pointing out the obvious
4598	1	lol ah the old when i came here i had x dollars in my pocketfyi it is an exaggeration
4599	1	isnt his real name logan paul or is that a different person
4600	1	what do you do
4601	1	um
4602	1	another bengali muslim here my parents hardly practice the religion but then ik theyre gonna go paranoid if i said that i was irreligious lmao
4603	1	i dont know what to say i dont want to make fun of you for being dumb but maybe i should would it make you try harder you probably wont believe me anyway idk try harder
4604	1	its not more difficult being a black male compared to being a south asian male and very few people actually think black people are especially cool they have many celebrities in popu culture but that doesnt make the average person consider any random black person cooler as a result
4605	1	i should have specified this is just the us portion of cry like you said who knows how much money is pocketed after it leaves us as charity and reaches india
4606	1	bro that sunil thakker dude is a pedo i think the girl in the case had a relationship with him since she was 16also my distant uncle was in that movie ayyy for thambiiiiiii
4607	1	yes in terms of their medical issues they go to the doctor frequently they are taking care of their health i have a younger sibling my parents are very adamant and want to live on their own when they are olderyou are right it is not up to me but it hurts seeing both of them suffering like this day in and out even after i have moved outi am older mid 20s yes my parents otherwise are kind to me they have never pushed religion on me i havent seen a counsellor in regards to my parents
4608	1	um what that was the shit show with cobie smulders not about a family trying to run a company
4609	1	obama got stuff to do and they did get hillary to go
4610	1	there are also arranged marriages which are basically introductions done by parents which im fine with it every culture or group does that
4611	1	i did and i realized you cant properly jot down your thoughts
4612	1	honestly i really disliked my own culture is food as a kid because most desi restaurants made shitty food it is actually the one good thing about gentrification the overly oily food is lessening and indian restaurants are getting way better ambiance
4613	1	i think this is definitely the case for the mainstream muslim communities and especially when muslim girls marry out not nearly as big a deal for ismailis though at first it was just guys but now i see ismaili girls get married to nonismailis too it is kind of funny because ismaili parents definitely prefer their kids to marry ismaili but will often tolerate anyone except a sunni sunniismaili marriages always end with families tearing apart usually on the ismaili side
4614	1	if she wanted to get coffee you wouldnt be here wondering about it
4615	1	gt im sorry but the uk or australia just dont come close to what america offers economicallyamerica has a similar capitalist structure to the south asian countries you can earn as much as you like and accomplish the american dream you still pay for medical insurance and stuffplaces like uk are more welfare and there is more equality in wages healthcare is free and is good tax rates are very high if you earn a lotjust a perspective of someone who is not in the us
4616	1	your point on 50 of the country just further justifies mistrust of white people ive never met an irl trump supporter and thought besides the trump thing hes a good guy
4617	1	i see that youre really annoyed about this but by not tipping that worker is going home with less than a livable wage as i explained above please have some compassion and still tip even if stuff like this happens its the right thing to do also you have no idea if this is the waiters bias or the restaurants policy tipping and then talking to a manager is the best way to make a change in behavior without monetarily punishing the lowest cog in the machine
4618	1	there is a big difference people from all backgrounds criticize those things not just immigrants they are not a core part of american culturewhat i am talking about is more like indian people coming here and feeling like their culture is superior this goes away by 2nd gen my parents feel that halloween is a weird and messed up holiday same with christmas my dad saw a girl wearing a tshirt that said kiss me im irish and he wouldnt stop yapping about uncultured american people are i think it is very rude and disrespectful to immigrate to another country if you dont have an open mind about these thingsoh dont even get me started on dating they literally think that americans are literally degenerates because they date and dont have arranged marriagesthere was an indian guy who posted om rabcdesis a few months ago he claimed that he wants to move to america but he is concerned because of a lack of culture over here his post came off as very condescending and he eventually deleted it it reminded me a lot of my parentsin the uk they did a random poll of muslim people walking in the street and i was shocked to hear what they said a lot of them said they would support sharia law in the uk and another poll asked them if they thought there was a distinct british culture or if british culture was just multiculturalism everyone i saw in the video just said it was multiculturalism
4619	1	very impressive kudos
4620	1	you may be correct butive grown up with white kids constantly trashing india for it is funny names and savage culture yet they were always hush mouth when it came to saying anything against black folks places like rindianpeoplefacebook are humiliating to read particularly the comments places like rblackpeopletwitter on the flip side show very intelligent and insightful tweets by black folks
4621	1	my story is crazy similar to yours when we came to canada my parents were definitely educated but poor as shit i totally remember living in one bedroom apartments and buying only thrift store clothes my dad worked as a telemarketer while my mom restarted the process to be licensed as a physician we worked and lived amongst other people that were like us so our situation never made me feel poor after my mom was fully licensed we finally had money my dad then had time to restart his engineering career now were completely fine but i remember those days really wellthis also isnt to diminish anyone is painexperience that was worse or better than mine but it goes to show that you never really know anyone is story nowadays we have plenty of money but you would never guess that my dad who now has a bmw used to take our grocery cart walk and bus it to the grocery store during the winter months for food and bus it for hours for work we got pizza hut once every 36 months and we used to be so incredibly excited about that while my relationship with my parents is tenuous at best i will always be thankful to them for their incredible perseverance and sacrifice
4622	1	pigskin already means football though
4623	1	thats true which is why i explained it helps confronting bigots you came off as a bigot until you clarified your stance which is why i hope you remember to employ nuance so as to not come off as something you may not be
4624	1	lol nope im in ireland mate  i dont think people here use that
4625	1	except they were gifts they werent the property of an indian state they were private property of indian people
4626	1	why would a tourist go to south side queens im literally talking about people going to touristy areas in india and getting incessantly harassed and followed pretending this doesnt exist or trying to compare it to a gang invested area of an otherwise super safe city in america is stupid
4627	1	the thugees a hindu tribe in central india and west bengal were occupying a piece of land that the british wanted so they made literature about how the thugees were brutal savages which made thug a pejorative and made it legal to murder every single member of the tribe including women and children which they for the most part did
4628	1	a lot of bollywood actresses and models actually come from indian army and military backgroundsexamples preity zinta sushmita sen lara dutta anushka sharma priyanka chopra
4629	1	dont you just hate it when you forget that youre married and casually go out on a date
4630	1	correct what is even sadder is that barely anyone knows how cruel the portuguese were to goans especially during the goan inquisition
4631	1	gtsorry this sounds like bullshit if he said most grooming gang members are of pakistani descent then that would make a lot more sensethat is what he is saying people are just reading the headline from the article gtwhen it comes to gangbased child exploitation it is selfevident to anyone who cares to look that if you look at all the recent highprofile cases there is a high proportion of men that are of pakistani heritage
4632	1	i mean what about the kashmiri pandits and the millions of innocents killed by terrorists edit sorry there have been credible valid violations of human rights of kashmiris by the indian military yes this is one of many sides but it is still a valid side it truly reprehensible and i apologize if i spread misinformation i hope and pray for the reconciliation of our peoples
4633	1	bad analogy bhagat singh didnt kill any indians who thought india should stay with the british especially the people who advocated for it peacefully and indians didnt ethnically cleanse all the christians and muslims out of india and then claim that everyone left opposed the british rulealso the civilians i am talking about did not die in a war here dont mispaint what i wrote they were deliberately killed because they are not in support of the terrorists agenda deliberately killed as in shot outside their home if you murder anyone who opposes what you say then how can you claim that the vast majority support you
4634	1	lol maybe because of the stereotype that a lot of desi is own toyota
4635	1	people use cars because the roads and public transport are terriblebest way to scale back car use is to develop and encourage public transport there are many ways to do this
4636	1	seems like an obvious answer dating apps but if you dont like them and want that real world encounter go do so group thing like group exercise classes cooking painting salsa etc
4637	1	whats the context is this some random girl youre trying to ask out are you two good friends do you regularly text
4638	1	and why is that is it good
4639	1	now youve got me wondering if i have one hahaa like aw or like the letter
4640	1	actually a lot of parents dont want their kids to play football for that reason personally i believe in freedom and think it is ok as everything has risks in life
4641	1	i support them ridding india of middle eastern wannabes all things foreign shouldnt be welcomed in india pakistan was made for that reason
4642	1	thanks bro it is nice to see other desis breaking out of the mold as well i careershifted when i found out that i could only get into the caribbean med schools and didnt want to go there now im in a different field and would also love to write some day what have you written this far
4643	1	and that is perfectly fine you are not required to love a culture just because you are born into it
4644	1	it doesnt work well for indians not enough data points i think apparently i am part asian native american and hawaiian bullshit
4645	1	lol cool i personally wouldnt call any of those abnormal interests since i have similar ones replace graphic design with japanese fencing and youd get me but that is probably why i dont find desi friends with the same interests either
4646	1	i agree that if you want to do something you have to actually be in india even mahatma gandhi had to leave south africa and go to india to be effective just like gandhi went back i too am planning on moving back america mere matrubhoomi lekhin hindustan mere karmabhoomi
4647	1	ah got it but i still think it is ridiculous to equate things that are generally accepted as a part of american culture like christmas thanksgiving easter 4th of july etc to racism and how we used to treat native americans
4648	1	i cant cook indian and tbf in london the indian food is probably one of the best as people said think its one of the spices
4649	1	haha salam brother how you doing its been a while inshallah ill see you on telegram
4650	1	yes i have also noticed that time and time again
4651	1	lol but on that fb page its mostly used in a self aware and funny way so i dont mind it it just adds to the humoras long as non south asians dont call other south asians currys in a denigrating way it is all good
4652	1	ok im not one of those people though
4653	1	handsome fella who is quite fit re muscles
4654	1	of course byou can care about your interests the conversation about what started the conflict was relvant to the comment thread later on in the issue
4655	1	what are you talking about if you mean khalistani and islamist separation groups yeah they are terrorist as recognized by most world governments no one goes around calling random people here terrorists funny how you only talk about when its regarding hindus though i can post about many articles regarding islamism and how prevelant it is in the west but i dont you know why because i know the majority of muslims here dont adhere to that if you think hindu nationalism is bad then i wonder what you think of how most sikhs in the west support actual sikh nationalism
4656	1	gt i dont think parents have anything to do with social anxiety  it just exists research disagrees there is a physical basis for people with anxiety disorders  the amygdala are enlarged a statistically significant amount of the time but not always but the hereditary nature of the size of the amygdalae is also a question mark because it is been shown stressfulabusive childhoods also cause enlarged amygdalae meditation btw has been shown to reduce the size of amygdalae in adults with anxiety disordersthere is also let me check my notes here some issues with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in people anxiety disorders  this is a part of higher brain that modulates regulates the appearance of the amygdala is uhh generated stuff in the conscious mind   and people with anxiety disorders seem to have depressed activity in this area relative to normal peopleat any rate the brain is malleable  the very fact that meditation can reduce the size of the amygdalae in adults and the fact that not everyone with largerthanaverage amygdalae has anxiety disorders indicates that environment is important to how one processes anxietyand since the major influence on a child is environment is their parentsi think ulookinshreddedbro is actually right on the money that undersocialization is a decent cause of social anxiety  if it has a purely genetic basis then the parents would have it too but they dont  now obviously there is probably a genexenvironment factor but principally in my experience desi parents especially the more conservative ones think they can keep their kids from becoming westernized or degenerate by preventing or discouraging their association with white kidz  not a problem if you live in a heavily desi community but if you dont the kids are going to grow up heavily undersocializedand the parents are totally unaware of this  they grew up surrounded by peers outside of school and took it for granted  they dont think about it and assume their kids are going to be fine but it is a major riskyour bones need calcium so they can develop properly  if you want to gain muscle you need a ton of protein  for the brain to develop properly it needs the correct environment  peer relationships are necessary for the brain is ability to learn how to navigate social interactions

4736	1	yes but diversity of wealth and socioeconomics is the more crucial aspect of society not to mention how disenfranchised poor asians or ethnic minority asians who are lowincome suffer at the hands of this policy hence why it is hypocritical to say it is advancing ethnic minorities plight telling people ivys arent everything isnt the solution because really it means everything to that mexican or african american or native american applicant that got in why exactly should a rich nigerian family have a much easier time getting in to college than a poor hmong one they already have wealth and now they have it even easier if america truly is postracial and we truly dont want to disenfranchise those hardworking minorities you know the ones much akin to those in your article then aa needs to be removed on the basis of race

4741	1	she is definitely not darker skinned and if we are talking about good representation we need to address racism and the feelings towards black ppl im not interested in any institution that puts races down like that ive seen some awful jokes made against gays and lesbians as well the fact you dont care mean im done with this conversation so im blocking i dont have time to argue you sound like you erasing this racism and using deepika as a totem for darker hues shows how delusional and pointless this conversation isill say this again bollywood upholds sexism they show 50 year old  very marginally attractive man  with supermodels 20 years younger of course some desi men are going to defend that while also attacking hollywood for being bad at representation because shockingly its so much better for women lower caste individuals gays and lesbians and im not going to bother with having a conversation with someone who only interested in how representation affects him
4742	1	there will always be a disconnect each generation has different experiences in the west and growing up outside of south asia and being labeled as a minority binds the indian community together much differently then living and growing up in the homelandlike i said i wish there was some sort of asian comradery i personally have never seen a foreign desi do that but it sucks that some people go back to india and discriminate against their own community i have however seen the opposite where homeland desis make fun of foreign desis aka being told we werent indian enough or made fun of for having an accent while speaking hindi or gujarati maybe it depends on the family and the person but as far as i know a lot of parents of abcds always emphasized how lucky we are to come from two great countries  guess im idealistic in wishing that we all people in the homeland and outside the homeland just try to treat each other with respect and come together especially regarding social issues that effect our community

4750	1	gt that was incompetence not malicethat might up for debate im not doubting that it was incompetence but malice was certainly there that being greed i mean that is what drove global european imperialism greed after all the british came to india under the guise of the british east india company and ended up establishing rule in the country would you argue that imperialism was entirely malice and not incompetence or viceversagtrussia and iran pumped money into insurgent terrorist groups to continue destabilizing the region russia for arms sales and iran to ensure regional hegemonygtthat was malice on their partwhile i agree with your assessment it is entirely disingenuous to claim that the us didnt pour money into various insurgenciesgovernments around the world out of incompetence rather than malice russia employed it is proxies ie iran and syria whereas the us did the same gtthe nato countries pouring money into the region was because they saw an opportunity to remove a close ally of russia and also feared for the continued unfettered expansion of isis except isis was born out of americanbritish failures in iraq make no mistake nato was involved in the syrian civil war as early as the russians and iranians they were secretly moving arms through turkey and jordan into syria and they certainly did so in order to protect their israeli interest and dismantling their nemesis in iran and russiathat is also malicegthad russia and iran not rushed to support assad hed be dead alreadyyoure  forgetting that assad was on the losing side due to support from the us saudi arabia and turkey for the syrian rebel groups the cia is tow antitank program via saudi arabia changed the tide of the war for the rebels which was only countered by russian air support make no mistake syria became the testing ground for both russian and american weapons at the behest of syrian liveswhich brings me back to the main point the west including russia fucked w syria and then have the audacity to claim malice on the part of the syrian refugees they created and the destruction of their country
4751	1	i wouldnt say that in india for example jewish people and hindus lived very peacefully as did christians with hindus just because a minority religion exists in a muslim majority place doesnt mean they dont face discrimination iran for example makes sure that all religious groups have representation in the government but that doesnt mean they dont get discriminated against joe rogan made a point that there are good cults and bad cults he compared islam to the mormons and how each religion reacted to when they got criticized and made fun offin fact the onion was so confident that only one religion has this problem that they made an article on itnsfwhttpswwwtheonioncomnoonemurderedbecauseofthisimage1819573893

4755	1	oh shit really that is so weird
4756	1	so the answer to a valid concern is a personal attack excellentthat said have you visited world heritage sites in india the management is piss poor and it is abundantly clear where governmentsactioned funds actually end up hint it involves corruption just look at the scrawling on the walls of ancient relics this tells you just how much the indian state and the indian public value their own heritage in their own country before staking claim to what other have stolen yes surprise i acknowledge that colonial powers engaged in theft the indian state must first learn to value and maintain what it currently has within its own borders

4758	1	why are you so eager to die on this hill i would rather live in a diverse neighborhood than somewhere with an ethnic majority if i wanted to live in a neighborhood like that one that doesnt assimilate i would just move to maine mexico china or india because they have ethnic majorities and barely any minorities im against ethnic enclaves no matter the ethnicity if people move to a new country they will have to assimilate i wouldnt move to the uk and just hang out with other americans i would try to learn the british customs and culture and try to replicate it
4759	1	none of them explicitly mention the words representative democracy but that is one of the attributes of our country lol
4760	1	i think it has more to do with indian culture than hinduism specifically the two are almost indistinguishably tied in india but you dont often hear people pointing to specific wordstexts from hinduism in defense of homophobia like they do with christianity and other abrahamic religions i think it is part of the culture in most parts of india and has to do with deeprooted issues with patriarchy in indian families and familial succession that along with just general misunderstandings about lgbtq and lack of education
4761	1	you do realize that not all brown people are the same right there could be as much difference between a up guy and a tamil guy as between families of italian and lithuanian descent in the us if you want to live in a diverse neighbourhood that is your choice but i dont think it is correct to define assimilation in such a narrow way ie based on your neighbours are the people moving to the us not learning english are they not speaking in english when they interact with others in the public space are they not adopting local laws dress codes and habits about what is acceptable and not acceptable in public space hell even their houses in those neighbourhoods have the same fucking floor plan as every other house in that city including a useless fireplace that most of them barely use
4762	1	first of all lets make something clear that my nation is the us i have no beholden ties to any other country secondly it is a surprising double standard when no one bats an eye to 170k people being forced to leave the valley edit it is indeed just one side there are valid arguments on the contrast i pray for the reconciliation of our peoples
4763	1	gt ginger garlic is a part of the sauté though you can ask any indian mom and she will tell you thisgt to sauté basically means to quickly fry in fat sautéing the ginger garlic after adding onions will make it easier for you to not burn the ginger garlic paste  the ideal way is always  oil gt onions for 1015min gt ginger garlic for 1min and then tomatosif you do oil gt ginger garlic gt onions gt tomatoes then your ginger garlic will become brown and burnt because it will keep sautéing while the onions are cookingsource  i cook 34 times a week and i am a better cook than most aunties i come across lol mainly because i make sure i use basic science when cooking

4801	1	its not something you need a source for really i highly doubt that the khalistani movement still has picked up steam in india or pakistan
4802	1	so you justify your own violence by commiting it against other you deem evil youre basically the same as the rapist the crime is different but it is the same bloodlust

4804	1	parts of alabama arent that bad but there is definitely some areas that i tend to stay away from source am abcd raised in alabama
4805	1	going to give benefit of the doubt since you said 3 decades ago but back on the day many immigrant parents wanted their kids to master in english as they thought it would provide them so many advantages it was also thought mixing languages can be confusing obviously now we know that with research that that is not true but many thought that 3 decades ago i would not put any fault on the parents who wanted their kids to excel in english as they just did what they felt best at that time or even if they feel it is not necessary to pass down a language your aunt was part of that era your cousins can always can access tools if they desire to each their own and doesnt make one a bad parentalso i disagree that life may not give you the time you can make the time if you put in the effort it may not be 247 but putting in a little time can even help tremendously it just takes working around it
4806	1	ewwwww
4807	1	lmao people from my town high schoolcollege have been posted there
4808	1	nope the place i live in is pretty diverse have a lot of desi friends and no one was ever beat up sure a few racists called us terrorists and stuff and would scream at us after a terrorist attack i am a muslim and more people have targeted me because of my faith than my race then again my black friend is also a muslim so he got the hate for that as welli have never been stopped by the police and searched by police because i match a description my sister has never been followed around in a store and then stopped to empty out her purse and bag like his my friend is sister has beenim not sure what your last paragraph is implying in the end the fact is that it is better to be a brown person in the us than a black person then again it is like having the flu over chickenpox i dont really see the need to be racist against black people just because white people tell me to stop reinfocring stereotypes and having a chip on your shoulder about black people and move on with your life
4809	1	hmm im actually fine being lumped with pakistanis  it is 70 years vsa few thousand the majority in power hindus vs muslims obviously differs but we have so much more in common than differences sane vs crazy people exist in both countries most of the time on this sub i actually see people celebrating their uniqueness as opposed to focusing on the differences there is a very clear difference between the two in regards to we are only hurting us when we dont speak about our identity i feel like youre conflating being indian with being hindu as the poster below said there is a huge subsect of muslims in india they are just as indian as we are if not more so as i was born in the west haha secondly there is an artificial line drawn between them and us no absolutely not this isnt a line divided by religion the divide is between the crazy racistsfundamentalists on any side that attack innocent people vs us by declaring you are not one of the bad ones you legitimize their point of view this is utilized all the time when the press accuses someone of being gay a topic to discuss ive seen many celebrities just not comment or say so even if they were straight theyre standing up for their fellow human beings theyre letting others know that they are not embarrassed or ashamed by that label  lastly if someone did die by not declaring themselves are hindu or whatever if they were given that chance that individual died standing up for what they believed inthat is not a tragedy that person died being true to themselves the tragedy is that people thought religion or brown skin is a reason to kill someone

4828	1	gt this feeling of sikh vs hindus is almost nonexistent in indiathis is not true maybe in the cities in the urban centers but even there it exists to some degree it is just not on the surface or talked about saying shit like this is like looking at a post office in america on weekend morning and exclaiming there is no racial tension in america look everyone of all colors are standing in line quietlyhow could a country that not 30 years ago saw a violent genocide not have a residual ethnic tension sitting latent i cant even call your comment foolish because it is so obvious youre attempting to absolve any blame from the dominant culture of india
4829	1	my mom explained because they have sex in that garbage not for kids i secretly love classic vintage simpsons
4830	1	desis are at best slightly better than outsiders at understanding the diversity of south asia as someone that is of mallu christian descent my indianness was routinely questioned because i didnt have a hindu or muslim last name several of the desis i grew up with could not comprehend a fair skinned south indian with a christian last name even today i come across people that assume i am whitewashed because i have a christian last name and am fairer than the average north indiandespite the fact i often know more about south asian culture and history than they doampx200bin short i dont think south asians can even fully comprehend or handle the diversity of india in a decent way so it is hard to blame outsiders who cant either

4834	1	hey thats what you gotta do parents dont like to be told what to do they love to tell us but damned if we try to knock some sense in to them im in the same boat of now just trying to avoid conversations for a multitude of reasons ive got a startup im trying to build with my wife just had foot surgery and a whole bunch of other crap and knowing all that full well its always why im not being a good brother to a sibling with relationship issues even though ive been the one helping them through it all despite it having direct effects on visiting my parents for the holidays and it ruining shit for me and my wife anyway i digress point is putting your foot down and stopping the bullshit in whatever way you deem best has always been the best but also the hardest way of doing things it sucks and if your mom cant deal with your relationship history thats on her let her be disappointed let her deal with the community and when she tries to guilt you into somehow this being your fault for how she feels end the conversation hang up change the subject put it back on her and ask her why she needs to do this to you as for the shaadi shit i get that too i met my wife on it and her mom was trying to control how her profile looked and whatnot thing is you have all the control start getting weird emails and proposals troll them have fun with it make it so hard to be controlled that your mother just gives up and ifwhen you do decide to have them meet your partner just show them your happiness shell throw shade and try to make you feel bad but at the end of the day you get to control what you do this is all super fucking cliche and always easier said than done and lord knows im still working on setting these boundaries but damnit we have to if we keep letting this shit get to us well just do it to our kids in some shape or form regardless i wish you the best of luck with whatever you try to do it doesnt really get any easier to manage after marriage but i can say that having the right partner to help you talk it out and be a sounding board is the best you can hope for it makes establishing those boundaries easier because you can focus on them and your relationship and enjoying that without getting sucked into the quicksand of desj mother guilt and if you ever want to chat im more than happy to

4839	1	committing a crime and being a jerk towards other people are two completely different things many of us were jerks or assholes growing up but people mature and change many people have once held views and opinions which they are super embarrassed about later in life this is not comparable to people like kavanagh who actually committed a crime on top of being an asshole

4843	1	lmaooo omg that is hilarious freakin autocorrect yes even if we grow up in the west we have additional cultural experiences that are a part of us still so it is important to have a sense of confidence and respect for the positive things it offers by embracing our culture and features we shape how other people see our culture and features as well  i notice that the people who embrace their identity are the people who form the best bonds because it is rooted in something authentic and i think so many people are naturally drawn to authenticity

4851	1	im sorry  i always give guys from india a chance but you have to understand that a lot of girls have had bad experiences with guys born and brought up there most of them probably just with creepy persistent messages but also as someone that has dated a couple people from there some of them really dont seem to understand the concept of consent one guy i met didnt even know how pregnancy occurred he thought that a girl needed to orgasm to get pregnant and he was in his late 20s india needs sex ed its stuff like that that turns me off of trying again with them after i do give them a chance i hate to generalize but i just want you to understand where its coming from

4887	1	gt could be more of a mirpur problem than a british pakistani problemthis is what i suspect as well although speaking to a non pakistani mate of mine who married into a pakistani punjabi family it seems like it is not that uncommon however were back into anecdotes hereeither way mirpuris are the majority of pakistanis here

4895	1	as someone currently seeing a therapist i thought that too however for my own issues i needed someone who actually understood the culture i was in i think it all depends on what the therapy is for

4900	1	most kashmiri muslims dont care about being pandit lmaoo they do take pride in the fact that their ancestors converted to islam despite the caste privilege they had
4901	1	gtall im saying is that the indian official is accusations against pakistan are baseless and irresponsiblethey are irresponsible for sure as it doesnt add much to the conflict but the question as to whether they are baseless depends on actual facts and determining that based on media reports is not responsible do you not agree that media reporting is biased and thus people is opinions can be manipulated based on what they read in the media

4907	1	to be honest im not super wellversed in quant or tech finance jobs since most of my work is qualitative rather than quantitative as far as i know across wall street most of the best frontoffice investmentrole quanttech jobs would be trader roles at prop funds like jane street where the pay is absolutely amazing and the work somewhat interesting however people dont typically work from home in these roles and will typically be in the office mf 12 hours before markets open and 12 hours after close  i dont know too much about frontoffice quants in ib so i dont really want to accidentally give you the wrong advice all i know is that some ibs are opening quantspecific mampa groups but these will also require you to be in the office quite a lot if youre not looking for traderinvestment roles there are many tech jobs on wall street that allow you to work somewhat from home these are usually middle or backoffice positions across industries in finance for example some of the more techfocused people where i work are able to work from home mondays and fridays however there arent any purely workfromhome jobs these jobs have significantly better hours 85 mf sometimes less but they can get tedious and boring on the other hand the pay is great for the amount of workall of this will change in the coming years however as quant roles are expanding significantly across the board
4908	1	i feel like there is a difference between hindu and muslims here tho unless your sister is a muslim in which case ignore what i saidfor hindus its just a tradition thing and usually they get over it when you have a kidfor muslims its very explicitly banned in the religion for women to marry outside of their religion

4923	1	gt but ive never encountered any evidence that gandhi actually changed his viewpointsokay let me help yougt  the corps which served for a little over a month was asked to take care of the wounded and whipped africans since no white would treat them seeing the brutality of the whites against the africans was a traumatic experience for gandhigt nelson mandela wrote in an article in time magazine on december 31 1999gtgt his awakening came on the hilly terrain of the socalled bambatha rebellion  british brutality against the zulus roused his soul against violence as nothing had done before he determined on that battlefield to wrest himself of all material attachments and devote himself completely and totally to eliminating violence and serving humanitygt he took a vow of celibacy and wrote to his brother that he had no interest in worldly possessionsgt during the course of the struggle gandhi widened his horizon and publicly supported african rights he declared in an address to the ymca in 1908gtgt south africa would probably be a howling wilderness without the africansgtgt if we look into the future is it not a heritage we have to leave to posterity that all the different races commingle and produce a civilisation that perhaps the world has not yet seengt he also praised african leaders in his reporting of a speech made by dube for indian opinion on september 2 1905 he said that dube was an african of whom one should knowgt he commended the efforts of john tengo jabavu to raise the enormous sum of 50000 pounds from africans for establishing a college for africans he wrotegtgt  it is not to be wondered at that an awakening people like the great native races of south africa are moved by something that has been described as being very much akin to religious fervour british indians in south africa have much to learn from this example of self sacrifice if the natives of south africa with all their financial disabilities and social disadvantages are capable of putting forth this local effort is it not incumbent upon the british indian community to take the lesson to heart and press forward the matter of educational facilities with far greater energy and enthusiasm than have been used hitherto indian opinion march 17 1906gt hermann kallenbach an associate of gandhi spoke of their identification with africans in an interview in june 1937gtgta black man may not use tramcars so we walked together for miles a black man may not use a hotel lift and bathroom so both of us gladly left the use of both a black man may not eat in the common dining room so i said i would not go there myself and we had our food in our rooms harijan june 12 1937gt he said in a speech at oxford on october 24 1931gtgt  as there has been an awakening in india even so there will be an awakening in south africa with its vastly richer resources  natural mineral and human the mighty english look quite pygmies before the mighty races of africa they are noble savages after all you will say they are certainly noble but no savages and in the course of a few years the western nations may cease to find in africa a dumping ground for their waresand lastlygt mandela was well aware of the racist statements made by gandhi when he was young he wrote in an article in 1995 gandhi must be forgiven those prejudices and judged in the context of the time and circumstances we are looking here at the young gandhi still to become mahatma when he was without any human prejudice save that in favour of truth and justicegt httpsthewireinhistorygandhiandafricansyou are focusing on mohandas who went to africa people remember the  mahatma who returned from there

4938	1	it is an issue that i have always been aware of since i was a kid it is something that i accept and deal with it but i do have sometimes the wish to look different and blend more in the crowd and not look different i say it it is stupid being an old woman and still having these paranoias about skij color but i do wonder if sometimes people just look me in a different way and i ask myself is it because of my skin color

4956	1	the flavour isnt the same
4957	1	obviously people become more conservative as they get older its the same as people who only wanted to date out suddenly looking for someone in their culture or someone more stable its the whole getting back to your roots and settling down although even then i doubt most mixed abcd will seek out desi culture over being integrated with white culture ive met very few mixed desis who get what it was like to grow up desi once those mixed abcds who many have a fleeting grasp of the desi diaspora to begin with marry out which im pretty sure statistically they will the desi culture in that lineage is gone anyway
4958	1	i like desi food i hate devon

4989	1	dera was also pretty good in jackson heights though their service is shit
4990	1	gt the uk is like 95 white and outside london closer to 995 of the people in uk are from the indian subcontinent forming the largest ethnic minority compared to the us where it is around 2 in us the largest ethnicracial minority are latin americans followed by african americans and then asians which includes everyone from asia indians are to uk are what latinos are to the america with respect to cultural acceptance and assimilation gt it is by far the most diverse nation in the westworldwhat is this based on if youre only looking at the white population then canada beats the us 73 vs 77 a lot of your comment seems to stem from patriotic fervour rather than facts

4996	1	that is the story of any separatist movement whether it is the ira in ireland pkk in kurdistan bahini in bangladesh or tamil tigers in sri lanka or the eta in the basque country civilians die in war on both sides the government however is the one in power is the oppressor and therefore kills more people disproportionately what youre saying is like the british shouldnt have left india because bhagat singh was a terrorist and therefore all people that were opposed to colonialism were terrorists
4997	1	boss you seem to be getting worked up over this im not trying to throw shade on anyone or anything it would be interesting to see a maharastra tribe with the same last name unconnected to islam in india in any way and itd be also interesting to see also how those tribals ended up in north west india as you keep insisting that the maliks there are not the ghatwal zameendars
4998	1	gt people who have issues indian girls marrying into other ethnicities are just plain losers who talk out of the jealousythank you this whole sub needs to hear this so tired of omg why do abcd girls only date white guys
4999	1	any recommendations
5000	1	if you think the girls here have a lot of options youre gonna be blown away by the girls in india all those modern city girls are in high demand right now to the point each one has multiple suitors to pick from so unless youre the cream of the crop in terms of looks wealth background etc youre not gonna have amazing luck there either
5001	1	love me some dosa hutt
5002	1	imo the chain would have to have two separate pivot points to emphasize each one otherwise the pendants would fall over each other rather than hanging side by side itd look messy two separate chains is your best bet but give it a whirl i could be wrong have fun on your beard journey beware  its difficult to see yourself clean shaven afterwards
5003	1	it is very easy to focus on that when the government has virtually redacted the entire section on foreign interference in annex b which is to provide the findings of the report the entire section dedicated to foreign interference has been redacted i think it is safe to assume that india used the atwal incident to not only discredit the governments vetting process but to also carry out fearmongering tactics regarding so called sikh extremists in order to paint the canadian government in a bad light csis as stated in the article contends that the khalistani movement peaked in the 80 is and has declined thereafter moreover i do not see any other intelligence agency in any other country sounding alarms over so called sikh extremism  only india surely any one of the countries in the five eyes would have voiced concerns if this so called threat was credible india saw an opportunity to embarrass the canadian government and belittle the sikh population in one blow and capitalized on that
5004	1	i am a mixed pakistaniamerican and i identify strongly with my desi culture i speak urduhindi fluently understand a bit of punjabi and have tried to learn sanskrit here and there i can also read and write hindi and urdu i love everything south asian culture and history even my pure desi cousins dont speak a lick of urdu my mixed sister is not hostile to her desi heritage but is a bit ignorant and probably perceives herself more as a regular white person
5005	1	never asked out a girl go back to your inceldom
5006	1	eat candy theres a reason those mampm commercials make people smile
5007	1	gt even if that is the case maybe you just find banadeshi guys unattractive and that is okay is it really though to delineate in your own brain this group of people are straight up unattractive to me seems kind of bizarre like i cant imagine ever saying to myself flat chested or black women are unattractive to me maybe not my preference we the fuck that means but id be an imbecile to say i couldnt fall head over heels for anyone depending on the person
5008	1	hell this is how i felt going to my indian friends houses
5009	1	gt there arent that many intercaste friendships or relationships especially ones where it is more than one level apartthis is a wild claim and not one that ive seen in my experience to be true maybe it is different for us american born millennials but ive literally never even met a single one who cared about caste much less cared about it to the extent where they werent friends with people from lower caste are you talking about immigrants born in india or something
5010	1	gtno one on here is talking about the uscanadahave you checked the sub we are having this conversation in gtthis post was about indian govt trying to over flex it is muscles to make ordinary sikhs living the west look bad uscanada are part of the west eh the sikh extremists source their funds in us and canada the air india airliner bombing was on plane starting in canada and funds sources in canada so how is that not relevant gtit is a really common theme when someone cant take the heat so they choose to bring up something else to deflect and change the narrative i believe you are complicit in that as well gt nice try manhow nice of you to assume my gender
5011	1	what about if the parents need a lot of money for a new business venture legal issues  money beyond the anticipated costs of having them live with you and any future medical costs
5012	1	lol sorry i dont mean to offend anyone it was a joke about how bengali both bd and wb muslims and hindus have such a big identity crisis over india and bangladesh while the christians dont have that problem ive only met a few in bd but they are really cool
5013	1	we should spend tax money on helping underfunded communitiesregions because of this country is history it is mostly going to be regions with a high population of africanamericans that would come under this criteria with the rest being rural communities in poorer states this entire focus on race is unnecessary
5014	1	foot surgery eh shieet i had ankle surgery a few years ago  i know the pain good luck with your recovery
5015	1	those are my thoughts exactly good to know that maybe i wasnt absurd for thinking the girls may have thought i was after the guys lol

5017	1	rab rakha
5018	1	well he is been here since 5 homeland girls will be ok with that i would think
5019	1	it is pathetic the only person being emasculated in this scenario is the person who hates their race and heritage
5020	1	that is a pretty white thing to be
5021	1	do you actually learn to fight or is it just showy stuffi remember doing it as a kid and it was allstuff to make parents feel happy that their kid can do stuff like in the movies
5022	1	my personal belief which is based on informal conversations with such managers while having drinks is all these managers have been mistreated by their managers and they have put in a lot of extra hours to be where they are and they expect the same from their subordinates only indian subordinates though
5023	1	yeah ive tried all ive been trying for 3 years now nothing but kept getting declined changed pics and stuff no bueno even worked out and get toned no bueno meh
5024	1	exactly this and this is pretty much why i think contemporary indian culture is garbage if it was just my parents beating me all the time i could have just chalked it up to abusive parents but it was my indian teachers who beat all their students too i remember i was in indian schools until i was like 7 years old recently i asked a cousin and she said it still happens all time time over 20 years later you know what is worse the beating doesnt happen in indian international schools they only happen in the local schools they know it is wrong but they love hurting weak dependants anyway i remember when i was really young i head of students who are much older who fought back and beat up their teachers good on themthat is why i think indian culture is founded on abuse and control and i dont want anything to do with it
5025	1	my dad and his siblings grew up not learning or speaking konkani even though they were goan catholic as their parents didnt teach them they spoke english exclusively while growing up luckily for him my mom also goan speaks fluent konkani and he basically learned the language from her her parents and also was able to get  immersed in goan culture through them his siblings most of them in their 60s now dont know konkani and have occasionally tried to get in touch with their goan roots
5026	1	gt in the case of black eyed peas they usually give credit whenever they do sample desi songs william is a pretty big fan of indian music and usually mentions the original writers name on the record labeli was particularly amused when ilayaraja is song got sampled for the elephunk theme came on randomly in the car one day when my dad was with me and the look of confusion and this is blasphemy ಠ_ಠ was priceless
5027	1	yeah i would be ok with a non desi person my family wouldnt like it
5028	1	uhh she bought plants and murtis into panera wut
5029	1	okay so wheres the mention of it being a joke wheres the mention of the joke and wheres mention that it was a sort of comedy club in the title assuming makes an ass out of you and me
5030	1	maybe im just braindead because of exams but could you spell out the connection to the rmelbourne thread a little more carefully for me
5031	1	same sec marriage isnt even a law in the states the sc basically stated that you cant discriminate based on marriage it had no part with partys at all
5032	1	oh wow you learned shooting on a date thats mad cute lol i wouldnt wear it on me just because its illegal im in nyc so getting a gun would be tough as hell anyways theres also no concealed carry over here so odds are it stays at the house people tend to buy illegal guns just to rob othersfrom my experience lmfao no other comments needed
5033	1	brown on the outside white on the inside a coconut
5034	1	hahahaha you cant really blame desi guys p
5035	1	from what ive seen my parents and relatives find rounded features with light skin and jet black hair very attractive  basically they would find caribbean latinos attractive i had a cousin who would pass for puerto rican and after she got married i was hearing stuff like where can i get a hot girl like that for my sonnephew  it is a weird thing tbh but that is why i find the whole colonial thing to be somewhat farfetchedampx200bthis is a personal anecdote but i still think there is some validity to it at least among south indians dont know how north indians are about this subject
5036	1	thats the most antiindia sub on reddit search a proper website rather
5037	1	yeah hes half indian his mom is from kolkata i think
5038	1	i think youre being incredibly harsh or just watching the wrong movies i dont think you will get a hyper realistic bollywood movie about the abcd experience because the larger market is still that in india you wont get to see the struggles of regular abcds if that is what youre looking for hollywood will have to make those movies because it just wont cater to the larger hindi speaking audience in india even the few movies that do show the struggles of indian origin people abroad like my name is khan for example will tinted by the lens of indians living in india once in a while youll have a movie like english vinglish where the indian husband of the protagonist is shown as the asshole and the abcd niece is just a nice helpful person but the idea of the old movies where the abcd is just a spoil brat who in into vices is pretty much non existent in hindi cinema one of the links provided by op was a punjabi movie and that is not technically bollywood
5039	1	damn that is really sad i hate how we as a whole are less accepting of each other and are quick to put each other down like that i feel like a lot of abcds have gone through some seriously strong conditioning against native born desis
5040	1	gt not so easy especially if hes the eldest or an only son muslim boys from south asia often have to support their aging parenti mean he literally just has to walk out the door plus hes already looking at houses so moving out is definetly an option he doesnt have to live with his parents forever to support them lol
5041	1	i mean ive never heard of pav bhaji was wondering what region it is from
5042	1	lol oops
5043	1	oh ok so it was just a bigoted comment trying to discredit my opinion by alluding to my ethnicity as if thats somehow supposed to discredit me
5044	1	expose of actorsactresses comes to mind considering how its a very conservative culture
5045	1	this is one thing i cannot accept
5046	1	i mean my wording is a bit off i basically asked them whether it was better i married a nonmuslim desi girl or a muslim white girl honestly i am fine with a christian jewish or agnostic girl not matter the race but i was trying to prove a point to my mom not give her a heart attack lol
5047	1	yeah i just started my master is in stats and ive never struggled harder and it is only going to get harder i guess data science has been the hip thing for a few years now so everyone claims to be an expert lol

5051	1	only if it is even though i tanned on purpose and now my forehead is darker than the rest of my face and my lower legs dont match the rest of my skin at all because of how dark they are looks weird tbh
5052	1	gt  fyi usually stock broker usually helps others to get into stock market business lolwhere did you get the idea that i am a stock broker lol gtyou can obviously give your advice based on your career without others helpi did you talked about timing the market and i said it rarely works you didnt understand it so i had to provide links to help you understand what timing the market means anyway as i said knock yourself out
5053	1	because we earned it thats not privilege privilege is getting things for free
5054	1	from my experience puerto ricans and cubans dont get much resentment but its mexicans and central americans who do i think people truly just dont like breaking the social contract by coming here illegally and having to foot the bill from taxes and large societal changes
5055	1	i agree with this
5056	1	ivy league attendance is to desis what marathoning is to white people
5057	1	desi guys are 10x more attractive to me than other races of guys lol although asian guys are a close second
5058	1	i am living there right now i was shocked to see only three white kids in my sisters entire 6th grade when i went to go visit about 70 of her classmates were indianwhere i grew up i was usually the only indian kid in my class and maybe only 5 or 6 other indians or pakistanis in the whole school
5059	1	gt my brother is not some hot studi beg to disagree
5060	1	seriously yo what is your problem i didnt say i am putting all my damn stocks share in a failure company some times you gain money sometimes you wont which is why before you put all your eggs in one basket you have to do research where how long the companies been doing extremely well most rich people likes to invest  their money because so they can make more of it
5061	1	gtameircan desis are really a different breed from us british asianseven if we dont mention that desi diaspora to america is a bit different america is crazytown were all a bit fucking weird here we all seem fine and relatable to you guys over there until were not we probably watch the same movies listen to the same shit dress the same but after 30 mins of deeper conversation youre left thinking wtf did i just listen to

5066	1	there is an enormous variety among south asians though pashtuns are much closer to middle eastern peopleeuropeans than south indians for example
5067	1	im still working on consistency but at a minimum i fast for 13 hrs on good days i can hit 1618
5068	1	only if youre stupid
5069	1	this is exactly the kind of thought process which is completely wrong and ignorant if youd go to a mexican place youd know how wrong this statement is
5070	1	it is funny my mom even used the plant is feel pain too line on methe worst is when people ask me why i went vegvegan i tell the truth i learned more about the animal abuse that comes with meatdairy and i didnt want to support thatnow that really makes them defensivehow long have you been vegan
5071	1	yes that is a good point thank you
5072	1	that is sort of like saying that you cant be racist because you have black friends are you trying to wash away all discrimination sikhs have faced in india just because there has been a sikh prime minister by that logic now that obama has been the president for 8 years the us is a fine and dandy place for african americans
5073	1	on the other hand what just curiouswhat you say is true in general women tend to be treated nicer than men
5074	1	falsely lol even koreans would admit they are racist everyone knows this and yes there is racism all over the world einstein lol at you
5075	1	cousin vicky
5076	1	i just think that indian americans particularly leftleaning ones are cherrypicking indian culture to find only the good parts  they purposely ignore the bad parts which is because those parts are the opposite of what they preach as progressives  i think that is wrong and it requires a lot of cognitive dissonance to be a proud indian and also be a progressive
5077	1	and this is ehat cultural appropriation and why it is harmful we cant even enjoy our own food anymore  no it has to be geared towards the tastes of white people who will turn around and be racist shitbags to us
5078	1	that is america uk is very different
5079	1	oh my god are people like you real

5093	1	this is probably gonna be me 12 years into the future
5094	1	i agree my main concern was the requirements  it seems regressive to out people in tiny categories it could work for some just wasnt for me the few people i know who have met someone on there are divorced so idk what that means
5095	1	i found this song painful to listen to im not sure most people would consider this better
5096	1	used to work in the service industry can confirm that many indians not only tip less than white folk but our people tend to be highermaintenance customers ie asking for no x item replace it with more expensive y item etcedited for a spelling
5097	1	i couldnt disagree i love my folks but visits are kinda the max i can doonce saw a white girl about 19 ish at the beach with her family  calling her dad in a loving way and i felt guilty not everyone is rebellious in their teens some perhaps most seem to have healthy relationships with their folks
5098	1	my current lack of a love life along with a bunch of related issues has led me to feel kinda selfdestructive at timeswhat do you think motivated me in the first place  low bf is super awesome for love life its not just abs  those are not the first thing women see  even your face gets a lot younger and rugged looking pronounced jawline im sure it wasnt the only factor but the confidence boost and disarming first impression helped a lot in getting more dates
5099	1	yes because london is the uk lol sure
5100	1	im gujarati too and my white husband would love to learn but we dont know of any resources besides me trying to teach him we have two toddlers and i try to speak gujarati to them but i agree it is hard when im the only one doing it

5104	1	because none of this dumb shit affects you when youre living in india when you are a majority in your own nation by blood  little things like this hardly matterits only when you go out and become a minority in other nations that you start facing these issues
5105	1	agreed sudras were obviously contained and restrained to no end but it is extremely stupid to compare millennials ago to today how can they be more progressive that today that is just baseless optimism for their own time both greek and hindus were very liberal somewhere down the line it changed very horribly for us but we were doing quite well for some time for some people

5115	1	dude stop stalking me
5116	1	i am probably an extreme outlier here but i think dark skin is beautiful i find that a lot of south sudanese women have extremely smooth and taut skin it is unfortunate that humans seem to almost universally prefer light coloration in both sexes i wonder how pale everyone will look in a couple of centuriesmost modern turkish people are actually primarily descended from indigenous anatolians the central asian turks were quite successful in imposing their culture and language though by some estimates they only genetically contributed to about 20 of the average turk is genome still i am curious whether new reproductive technology will allow cultures from all around the world to select for pale features until almost everyone is blonde and blueeyed
5117	1	it would be interesting to see what caste they are in
5118	1	in a topic about his racism it is relevant to talk about his prejudice overall including sexism interesting that those mentioning gandhi is sexually abusive behavior get downvotes but those bringing up churchill or indirarajiv gandhi including pedophilia accusations are getting upvotes so this isnt about me being off topic some people are uncomfortable with others pointing out gandhi is wrongdoings
5119	1	lol i was surprised to hear this british accent coming from a face that says i am portland oregon

5132	1	not a complaint just an issue for conversation on this slow holiday week
5133	1	is it really that difficult to ensure a good debate on these topics among desis i used to run a huge desi messageboard in early 2000s and while it was difficult it wasnt impossible
5134	1	no idea but maybe you can ask them i think iranians and indopakistanis share similar genotypes not sure what the right term is called
5135	1	i think you forgot who instigated all those personal attacks  it was you
5136	1	woah i wish my school had horticulture competitionsglad to meet another desi who was on the guard
5137	1	average north india is 50 aryan 50  dravidian average south indian is 75 dravidian 25 aryan a north indian has more in common genetically and culturally with a south indian i am north indian and i look kinda fijian because at the end of the day we are a mix north indians are indigenous to north india
5138	1	there is nothing wrong to prefer to date within your own ethnicity true and yes it is not evil or narrowminded  a lot of people feel it is much easier to be in a marriage with those who have cultural similarities like them you are right i preferred desi of any background so dont care if punjabi tamil gujju though im mallu and my so ended up being a desi of a similar background like me at the end also mallu however  there is also nothing wrong with marrying outside of your ethnicity either and it can be unique as you can blend two backgroundscultures into one having a unique identity  my brother unlike me has a french fiancé and itll be interesting to see a indofrenchamerican culture be established or anything of that type since it is multicultural just like it does not make one narrowminded or evil if they prefer to marry within their own it also does not make one a race traitor or sellout if they choose to marry a different race everyone has their preferences live and let live
5139	1	i dont think my accent has negatively impacted me in dating at all i have a very deep voice also people cant hear my accent on tinder lol
5140	1	i feel guilty not helping them
5141	1	you should be able to tell after a year or 2 after being in the relationship by then youll be accustomed to that person and the dopamine and serotonin release will be normalized
5142	1	definitely it is not only abcds but immigrants do it just as much speaking of that this does not only apply to the desi diaspora but also among the general asian and other ethnic groups but in terms of nris i do see it happening where people segregate according to their regional groups and within the regional group they segregate into their religious sect or other traits for the matter this is very common among malayalees who are comprised of several religions it seems everyone only associate with people from their respective churches or temple and only make acquaintances or friendly greeting towards those outside of their group or other desisnondesis but never seem to be open to make friendships
5143	1	yeah white part making him look good
5144	1	so what you tryna say that the queen should return the royal family jewels to each respective country
5145	1	war eagle
5146	1	let me guess hes a conservative bonus points if hes a trumptardwhite nationalist
5147	1	nope its you who are wrong and youre beyond stupid bollywood has far better representation especially when you consider that they technically only need to represent hindi speaking populations white women are fetishized somewhat but they still mainly use indian women in their movies unlike hollywood who fetishizes indian and east asian women and only pair them with white men white women in bollywood movies are mainly used for background dancers or minor characters shut up and stop whining about misogyny indian men are treated far worse in hollywood than indian women are in bollywood and thats a fact youre one of those typical idiots who only think blacks and women are victims there are barely any black people in india so why should we cater to them you dont see indians in black hollywood movies and definitely not in african movies so no everything i said was fact and everything you said was wrong youre pathetic
5148	1	damn i want to know some of your recipes can i pm you
5149	1	he is right about nothing
5150	1	interesting my mum is a christian malayali from australia btw i am guessing youre from americai used to think i felt a kinship towards anyone of a south asian background because i didnt really know any outside of my own family and my family was culturally whitewashed as some may sayi definately feel some kinship towards indians who grew up not super culturally indian but i feel a huge disconnect towards others
5151	1	never had a dosa man you gotta go to a south indian restaurant and try one
5152	1	yeah apparently our kind isnt allowed lol you people suck
5153	1	tulsi gabbard isnt desi and the other three will never become potus
5154	1	economically they arent progressive they are conservatives socially they are progressive they say they support progressive economics in practice they implement republican lite policies in an interview obama himself admited on economics there is not a huge difference between republicans and democrats
5155	1	not really no they are not bitching they are just reacting to the huge ammount of women who bitch about men also they have very solid points about the flaws of feminism  many people who are mgtow still sleep with women but avoid relationships edit of course some extreme comments will be posted there every now and then but the core of mgtow is not similar to incels at all
5156	1	lol was so confused since i went to rick hansen in ontario  played ball
5157	1	if a nonindian talks about his problem its called venting if an indian talks about his problem its called whining we dont fit the liberal model and so were an unfortunate wrench thrown into their agenda
5158	1	i hope you realize that punjab is a state in india
5159	1	yea but we were sharing it with another bengali family because we just moved from dhaka to queens

5164	1	seems like the person who makes more money gets the raw deal so message for men marry up
5165	1	well the question was what supplement do you take and what supplement do you think desis should take there are literally two questions he answered the first question and then proceeded to answer the second question
5166	1	that is maalik pronounced like maaliq not malik
5167	1	my husbands family is hindu punjabi and several of his auntsuncles and cousins had had  arranged marriages with sikh menwomen as wellsurprised that anyone would act like its taboo at all

5169	1	muh taxes fuck this shit
5170	1	exactly
5171	1	never used it as justification was just going off of what the imperial japaneses agenda was in that region of the war while bringing light to atrocities committed on other sides so either way india wouldve been fucked
5172	1	churchill is racism towards indians was well noted and indiras issues towards ethnic minorities is also worthwhile to mention on the topic of racei think youre making this bigger than it is dude like yeah i dont think any of us disagree about his multitude of other issues were just talking about race rn
5173	1	out of those you listed only one fulfills the conditions i stated i made it unspecific so people can think more about it
5174	1	i think us immigration favors christians over other religions makes sense when you consider that the mallu community in the us is like 90 mallu christians vs 10 non christian mallus even though hindus are 55 of kerala is population
5175	1	not in grad school yet but do indian dance teams even exist at that stage usually most of the indians i meet whore super into that stuff are younger and arent abcds
5176	1	telugu
5177	1	yea no not all of them speak english we have many chinese people in the lab i work at and they are extremely smart in running experiments but lack basic english speaking skills
5178	1	ya thats true i like to think shes just venting and needs an outlet shes pretty entertaining imo
5179	1	thats the best part
5180	1	this as someone from an indian bengali family im so tired of having to explain to clueless desi people that no im not bangladeshi even though i share a language and culture with most of the people from there and no i have little to do with the north indian hindispeaking culture portrayed in mass media as indian a khasi person from meghalaya is equally indian as a malayali from keralait is understandable that outsiders might not realize that south asia is an incredibly diverse place and that indian and pakistani are not ethnicities but it is not for desi people and especially not for desi people who might get offended at being mistaken for being from another ethnic group as if somehow one group is better than another
5181	1	no its not lol i once had a guy who looked like hed been in a sweat rainstorm drip his sweat in front of me first time i ever saw someone sweat that badly while at a gymit can always be awkwarder
5182	1	im a minhasmanhas rajput itll be about that clan itll probably be published in 2020 or 2021
5183	1	dude this isnt the right time to joke
5184	1	its due to creeps as well as the typical hollywood media stereotypes which are the same as for asians in general like one being small penis which has been disproven but creeps aggravate that even more no girls do not flat out say that but i and friends do get weird looks sometimes when outand thats true about other minorities but honestly i am just tired of the constant indian creepy message memes we gotta stop that shit tbh i cant believe other indians are also engaging in it that does send messages to people at a subconscious level people may think not all are creepy but do they really act that way
5185	1	i have to ask my dad but i think we have some family here in the states that fled amin but thats not saying most
5186	1	gtwe still dont physically attack other racesroofkoreansjpgi agree with what youre saying just memeing
5187	1	can you elaborate i didnt quite understand what these vast differences are and who they are between
5188	1	honestly lots of doctors are pretty damn stupid
5189	1	desis in uk will always be foreigners remember you will never be considered british because you are not white us is a country of immigrants uk is not
5190	1	this might be a stereotype but knowing people raised in the west are more likely to tip both higher and more consistently just based on cultural custom is probably another easy reason for waitstaff to justify spending more time on nondesis the fact that youre threatening to not tip at all rather than tip minimally because of how other people are being treated just reinforces that they are justified in thinking sotable waiting sucks i think youre reading too much into this and taking it too personally
5191	1	didnt he sleep with underage girls
5192	1	waitthat is the joke that hour him kicked off   i feel like i heard it all the fucking time in the 90s
5193	1	lol its a legit fear for a lot of people what is a midwestern accent

5196	1	this is very true most indian restaurants have a fancy vibe to it  ive never seen fast casual indian food like other cuisines
5197	1	sometimes i worry that it never existed in the first place
5198	1	ive had some lovely conversations about their attempts to be vegetarian to say the least plus they are interested in what im eating and how much im eating and how to make tofu im also in a super liberal state so maybe it is that
5199	1	i dint know japan was colonising india then as far as saving india that is the bare minimum the empire could do to protect its biggest source of income
5200	1	gt i dont even understand what this sentence is supposed to mean or conveynot to mention youre ignorant of how or why individualism or communalism racists exists twas but a small auto correct error accept my apologies gt that doesnt really affect anything societies that favor individual rights or communal rights still can have law and order logical error number 1i dont think youre getting this very basic idea individualism is nurtured when law and order economic prosperity and safety are present with out those things individuals have to rely on the community and when reliance on the community is heavy then the community demands conformity thus we have communal living individualism doesnt matter when the community is everything which is what the case is developing nations  gt individual human rights have their basis in the enlightenment philosophy you know the stuff that enabled the world to transcend superstition and gave you modern science so a bit older than that seems like you actually may not progressed past anthropology 101lol what no dude youre confusing secularism with individualism gt it is obvious at this point you have no clue what you are talking aboutif im having to explain every little thing to you its clear who is having a hard time keeping up with what is being discussed gt you actually said that for pakistan just a post agoproblem is youre not understanding a well thought out nuanced position because youre an ideologue the very basic premise ive put forth is that individualism and communal living are byproducts of surrounding factors  you cant force your own ideology on anyone societies make rules based on what is pragmatic to them according to whether there is a need to rely on the community or not you see in the western world the state runs well people have economic opportunities they have access to speedy justice law and order works pretty well here so the community is protection and access to resources doesnt matter anymore you can simply move away from your community and be able to live a successful life with out needing people to vouch for your character with out taking loans from the rich within the community with out using your father is izzat as a credit check for your trustworthiness with out playing nice with the panchayat to receive justice i swear its starting to feel like im teaching a third grader lol gt the us isnt a christian republic not like the islamic republic of pakistan nice try thoughwhat it appears it becoming difficult for you to follow the discussion we were having you insisted that i should enroll in christian theology courses in order to integrate in to the us society i merely pointed out that us is a secular nation it would be weird to enroll in a christian religious classes to integrate in to a secular nation incidentally your own argument counters your initial insistence gt actually i can you see if migrants such as say yourself support barbaric ideas like say honor killings beating their women or preventing their members from exercising basic human rights then they should be educatednice strawman also what  my comment was regarding pakistan is integration of their minorities in to the larger islamic culture this comment was based on your insistence that minorities should be forcibly education to integrate youve totally ignored that and think honor killings and beating women is somehow isnt against the law in uk so it must be stopped by forced integration that is not a very good or accurate argument remember we discussed this before law and order is paramount if someone doesnt want to integrate that is just fine but if they break the law they are to be punished according to the law and are simply not exempt from it i dont know why you believe minorities in uk are excempt from laws regarding murder  gt shoving islam down their throats ala pakistan isnt exactly respecting their basic human rightsaccording to your argument that is exactly what needs to happen in pakistan if the minorities are to be integrated lol gt you called for objectivity and then told me my comfortable life in the united states which is very much my subjective experience should some how be an objective measure to judge communal societies dude its becoming very clear that this conversation is way above your understanding you cant follow a train of thought you cant even follow the discussion you dont understand basic ideas of individualism and communalism as being byproducts of external factors and im having to break these things down to you over and over again this is quite cumbersome gt that doesnt really matter though you can can your faux intellectualism what you are doing is implying communalism is better than individualism despite enjoying all the rights that an individualist society provides for one thing that is pure hypocrisyi certainly havent implied anything of that sort im merely trying to teach you that it isnt a moral issue as communalism and individualism are byproducts of impacting external factors that lead to one or the other gt maybe keep praying towards a cube that will teach you more about anthropologynow now i understand how embarrassing it can be for you  when a believer has to not only teach you but also hold your hand and help you think through these basic ideas which is why i dont mind when your antimuslim rage starts to surface
5201	1	most slimeballs support trump they see themselves in him and like getting their views validated through him fuckers

5246	1	i read there was a case where people used one of the ashoka pillars as a steamroller or something of the like this is a serious issue in india at least in the uk people are respectful of cultural artifacts im not saying that the uk deserves to have it but i dont consider it to be a big deal why dont we return literally everything back to its original owners give all the greek statues back to greece roman statues to italy egyptian mummies to egypt and youll be left with just a bunch of native american artifacts have fun with that
5247	1	hahaha that is hilarious this guy i had matched with last month told me he wants to send me dick pics literally the first thing he messaged me and i promptly unmatched him lol i once got flagged for sending a pic of food i had made they unbanned my account after examining it
5248	1	same dude i have had guys ask me if im talking to other people and i always feel bad answering the question i made the mistake a few years ago of investing too much into one person so now i keep my options open lol i tell my friends all the time that if they are really into someone they need to establish exclusivity or talk about it because you can pretty much guarantee that they are talking to other people
5249	1	gt how do you guys listen to music these dayswith my ears

5253	1	im a dude but i can help if you like
5254	1	you say this gt ethnic enclaves of any sort are inherently outoftheordinaryand then saygt  i personally grew up in a very white majority neighborhood so i feel comfortable growing uplivingraising children in an environment like my own just like literally everyone elsedont you see the conflict between those two statements you are comfortable in staying in an environment you grew up in then why is it so out of the ordinary when other people do the same by staying closer to people that are similar to themgt there absolutely is an issue of assimilation in these communities since they just arent indistinguishable from most communities in america ie whitemajority onesassimilation is a gradual process there is no switch that you can flick and magically turn from an average indian to an average american overnight most of the people staying in those enclaves are in the process of assimilation which is why you will see them speaking english shaking hands eating cereal everyday as if that is a normal thing to do saying happy holidays around december and using the word thank you for many tasks that would not receive a thank you in india that diversity the previous guy is so fond of wont survive if everyone tried becoming exactly like white people and white neighborhoods in every aspect and it is antiimmigrant to insist that first gen immigrants are somehow at fault for not being exactly like other people that have been in this country for multiple generations
5255	1	yes  it is worse when socalled when minorities internalize this and think theyre better than other minorities cause vee make 100k a year1 v r edumoocated1
5256	1	gt which came first and is that relevant to this conversationi think the answer depends on who you ask but i dont see the connection between military and the hindu minority being forced to leave people attacking the military could be justified depending on what happened first but why kick out the hindu minority unless you are trying to demographically alter the valley in your favour terrorist is fight against the so called military repression doesnt require them to kill unarmed civilians either was the news paper editor a secret agent for military no he was simply killed because he said something they didnt like they are trying to eliminate all opposition to them so that they can claim everyone favours us now if that is acceptable then india can flood the valley with other indians and then the vast majority would be in favour of india
5257	1	my comment was in response to tehranichickencurry who referred the terrorists a khaalistanis
5258	1	but arabs are the og muslims
5259	1	oh you guys took the shopping cart as well those bring back memories

5262	1	nothing to be proud actually i would prefer it if we pretend it doesnt exist
5263	1	again try to find those rights and freedoms in india and then get back to me
5264	1	how long of a communication gap are we talking about
5265	1	gt i dont know how hard that is for you to understandthat tone comes across as disrespectful to the conversation on this thread here is my initial comment  gt gtfascinating that people view this movement in terms of events back in india and pakistan while the bombing of the air india flight was and is the deadliest terrorist event for nation of canada and impacts the desi diaspora in that nation not sure why the comments in here are in context of india and pakistanand your comment was gtyeah but what does that have to do with sikh nationalism and selfdeterminism the terrorism is whole different thingso my context is the terrorist incident which occurred for canadians and how you are you steering this to india
5266	1	hahahafirst you said nobody outside india believes prakrit or sanskrit to be older than the old persian i gave you the confirmation from worlds best indologist michael witzel now you are shoving a wikipedia link to melmao feel sorry for you you dont know how indologyhistorians work dude
5267	1	i agree that they exist in every culture  in a way they are a part of human nature  i feel the same way about all other cultures  im specifically targeting indian culture because my ancestors were indians and i feel that gives me more justification to talk about past oppression in indiai disagree that they are equally prominent in other cultures  i think sexism and classism are much more ingrained in indian society than they are in many western cultures  i dont think we are at the point where india and indian culture by extension has grown past those regressive traits  so i think it is inappropriate to view those traits as purely existing in the past  i think modern indian society is still very much defined by those regressive traits more so than a country like america for example
5268	1	there was a personals threadhttpswwwnpredditcomrabcdesiscomments8fucqedesi_4_desi_personals_thread_round_2 a while back round three
5269	1	maybe sensitive isnt the right word but a lot of people here make a big deal out of everything
5270	1	listen to this personand the last paragraph is very important focus on making more friends then focus on attracting sexual partners and often if you focus on the first the 2nd ends up happening anyways
5271	1	haha can someone tell me where beta comes from
5272	1	poor baby
5273	1	you are delusional
5274	1	yes and didnt like jews and agreed with what hitler did a smart complicated man very difficult too and had abstract views on life
5275	1	ya theyre connected but a lot of it has to do with upbringing as well boys arent toldtrained to be more responsible as early as girls are they arent groomed that way by society 25 is the age that most peoples brains are thought to be fully developed ive never heard of a gender difference for that source
5276	1	im talking about desi hindus dumbass
5277	1	they cant be that bad force your small muscle bellies into hypertrophy either increase volume or weight and work on mobility and rom80 pound bench press is acceptable if you have one arm since you have two u might as well double it

5279	1	just social awarenessi use wet napkins to put on top of the container you could heat up your food without screwing up your container is lid and not leave strong scents in the wind
5280	1	if you hired a band to play at your wedding and they started playing some heavy metal music you didnt ask for and thats making your guests uncomfortable would you encourage them to keep playing so you dont suppress their musical talent because most people in that situation would tell them to leave you pay a person to perform something they deviate from the script or they just suck and most people would tell them to go
5281	1	he is gotta start transitioning into the amitabh roles sooner rather than later
5282	1	pakistani canadians arent doing much better compared to other immigrants but we still ballin much better than britpak
5283	1	indiboos
5284	1	as the great russell peters saidgtterrorists and indians are not the same we dont even hate the same people terrorists hate americans indians hate each other
5285	1	i just realized i actually have such a scenario in my family haha my cousin married an indian girl but he is not your average abcd he was born in the us but his family has always lived in india and he was brought up there moved here for undergrad and lived and worked here since he is a us citizen but till 18 he was living in india   from my understanding talking to my cousin and his wife people from india dont want to move to the us postwedding as much they wanted to earlier in the 90s most women have good jobs and semiestablished careers and moving to the us means a fresh start many are not willing to give all of that up and i havent actually heard about guys moving to the states postwedding
5286	1	prestige plain and simple desi culture is so heirarchical and respect oriented being a doctor is just the highest level of respect you can command so naturally it is the most desirable
5287	1	false flag opindian government wants to cover up their soldiers role in 1984 what better way to do than to label us extremists babbar khalsa leadership were killed and replaced with congress sympathizers
5288	1	how do the indian elections impact your life in the us
5289	1	that is a great insight but i think she is just a dick i have met so many fijians and not one of them were hostile about india they all wanted to travel to india and learn to cook indian dishes the traditional way etc
5290	1	are you implying that her being with nick jonas automatically equates to white worship
5291	1	us universities are much better for stem fields especially computer science even local schools such as uw seattle uiuc or ut austin are just as good if not better than oxbridge in these fields not to mention higher starting salaries
5292	1	nah 24 i am having this issue for past 3 years
5293	1	idk where you live but unless youre in a rural area or the middle of nowhere this shouldnt be an issue the vast majority of restaurants always have several vegetarian options these days being a vegetarian or vegan is a trend again you and your friends probably need to compromise better maybe go out to a super veggie place one day and then alternate the next time
5294	1	ikr talk about out of frying pan into the fire
5295	1	that is right thiru is a mark of respect like sri anantha is the name puram means towncity
5296	1	my parents hated them too but for some reason had no problem buying them for me mom once took a hammer to my brothers gameboy when we were caught playing on a school night got another the next christmas
5297	1	well jews in general dont have you convertthe  again judaism is probably the only religionethnic group with like 50 secularnonreligious followers
5298	1	this this is good lmao
5299	1	no you meant looks not personality get it right
5300	1	please do this mods almost all the flame wars on this sub are started by these nationalist types
5301	1	i was lucky enough to be clubbing in london and across england at the time so i saw everyone from malkit singh gurdas mann apna sangeet and heera to b21 sahara metz amptrix punjabi mc bally sagoo and dr zeus etc that golden era has ended but it was amazing while it lasted
5302	1	i wonder if living in a more abcd dense ups your chances of looking better to other people
5303	1	weve already seen exactly what you describe happen on imdb the top 250 where the presence has brought about all sorts of racist shit from people imdbs own reaction in that case was quite shitty too in that they raised the threshold and weight for super users and began creating separate indian movie lists in reaction until inevitably realizing that brown movies were coming no matter what and that they could capitalize on that traffic made me sick
5304	1	how the fuck are indians a minority
5305	1	of course
5306	1	the prophet pibuh also married a 7 year old child
5307	1	same here it appears to me that within the desi community people only support desis of the same linguistic and religious group and do not seem to offer that kinship towards other desi communities i personally feel a kinship towards all desi and not only malayalees and am willing to support them when needed
5308	1	i agree its possible but i cant imagine its a common sentiment
5309	1	and i can write basic code but i doubt either of those will help with hacking lolon the bright side this sub probably has a ton of itprogrammer people who can do a lot more
5310	1	nah my boy lover showed me to reins
5311	1	uh a business venture i treat like any investment i make if i dont think its a good idea i am not going to invest that would be irresponsiblelegal issues i would help with because family but it also depends what kind of legal issues
5312	1	sarsour is made out to be an antisemite because she is a hijabi palestinian woman who criticizes israel she basically checks all the boxes despite the fact that she has raised money for synagogues and also restored a vandalized jewish cemetary but to everyone she is hitler reincarnate lolocasio was labelled an antisemite for speaking out against the idf shooting palestinians and when she was elected she was basicaly told by donors to stop
5313	1	pretty much this pisses me off when people act like their ancestral homelands are innately shitty repressive unsafe places sure indians pakistanis etc bear some responsibility for the state of their countries but at the same time colonialism utterly ravaged them  the resources of entire continents were plundered and redistributed to europe the first world was built off stolen wealth from nonwhites 100   ive honestly never met an immigrant who genuinely hates the west just people who honestly call it out on it is bullshit and expose the hypocritical bullshit from the locals
5314	1	my city has at least 10 indian restaurants for every korean or japanese restaurant
5315	1	cant exactly force people to find a certain type of skin colour or group of people attractive no
5316	1	literally the whole college indian dance team circuit is abcds
5317	1	australian humor is aggressive and lacks wit imo what comedian has made it out of australia other than jim jeffries even jeffries isnt top tier with louie chappelle or rock i can think of more kiwis whove hit it big cause they tend to do smarter bits
5318	1	i always thought the opposite the more your shift towards lookingacting like someone whos not part of the majority the worse people are likely to treat you based on preconceived differences
5319	1	huh assume i have been to those places
5320	1	honestly fan was a pretty good film
5321	1	sorry no sarcasm i meant as a compliment analysis is spot on
5322	1	more service such as including free samplers so i guess being unaware also means one is also more hungry got it
5323	1	even with a phd life in india sucked in the 60s many people wanted out for anything
5324	1	lol that too
5325	1	there is no such thing as conversion to hinduism with sikhism too its not practiced as only a very small sect is baptized amrit shakk otherwise theres no way to convert to sikhism either
5326	1	indians and iranians are both the ancestors of aryans indoiranians who lived in central asia where aryans hinduism and zoroastrisnism are the religions closest to the original aryan culture
5327	1	haidt has some weird boogeymanstrawman crusade against yale students where he literally documents every protest   i personally think he is like a lot of older liberals who arent trying to understand where people are coming from and basically think the world is a meritocracy because he grew up rich
5328	1	thanks us oldtimers have to take what we get these days and lmao i barely consider bhangra a dance form the haka is basically stomping the ground and poking out your tongue no ty
5329	1	how many square feet
5330	1	kind of skeptical about that
5331	1	you can make more job for the same job although cost of living obv goes up but it isnt that big of a deal though and money universally makes your life better so i have to disagree with you
5332	1	oh okay lol sorry i didnt know who you were talking about
5333	1	yeah it is pretty bad people really cant drive out here
5334	1	dont tell me that canadian gurudwaras dont honor bindranwale and have pictures of khalistani terrorists because ive personally seen that in my visits no need to play the victim card and take responsibility for your community
5335	1	gtcore republican values are still the same though ie limited government lower taxes laissezfaire economics and deregulationyes i can agree with that i was a republican up until 2008 their fiscal and pro business stance is why i was one but that isnt the problem the problem is their shift to the extreme on social issues  look up the many articles written on why majority indianamericans and asianamericans dont vote republican  youll see a common theme it has very little to do with fiscal policy  gtnot a fan of the racists of course but i dont think they represent the platform of the republican partymaybe not but the republican party does have a racism problem the moderates have been squeezed out until they do something about rebuilding their brand around the above core principles they will continue to shrink and become the party for white grievance and tribalism
5336	1	dude that is what is so funny being 1 youtuber means nothing to pewdiepie anymore everyone acting like they care is hilarious
5337	1	dont forget those god damn fresh off the boat indians who are destroying their image
5338	1	while i get your point things like makeup are usually done to enhance your features and most people ive met do it for fun  something like skin bleaching is literally based on the belief that for one to be attractive they must have fair skin  i grew up in an environment where i was complimented on having fair skin and heard things like awww that girl would be so stunning if her skin wasnt so dark these attitudes are racist and are what cause people to do skin bleaching therefore the issue of skin bleaching isnt that people want to change themselves  it is that people are viewing themselves as insufficient due to the colour of their skin and potentially putting themselves in harms way to conform to racist beauty ideals
5339	1	nothing just as long as its not at the expense of or putting down other religions
5340	1	salam pakistanicanadian here can readwrite urdu fluently its my first language _ im interested in both translations and writingthanks for the tag usunlighttt
5341	1	eh its observation bias on your end indians in general outmarry less than anyone else that said if youre a member of a minority datinggetting with a member of the majority is part of selfactualization for some people goes for guys too
5342	1	well it was practice for our upcoming diwali dance and not actually a puja but we were in the mandirplus the kid wasnt actually there but his name came up and the aunty said wait his parents actually named him that we just looked at each thinking what is wrong with his name then someone said what is wrong with hardik and it was like a lightbulb went off in our heads and well there was no turning back
5343	1	ha that is a defeatist attitude i know who my enemies are
5344	1	the name comes from one of the tribes in the mahabharata doesnt really have anything to do with arabs seems like eastern europeans also have that surname but it means something else
5345	1	yep and stats too and bunch of other maths haha
5346	1	gti would want them to know about the persecution of sikhs in india by hindus as well because there isnt a point in trying to hide thati hope you also educate them about the persecution that hindus had to face at the hands of sikhs rindiaspeakscommentsa535a2bhindrawala_says_mei_5000_hindua_nu_ik_ghante_chand also that there are sikhs and hindus who believe that sikhi is a sect within hinduism as opposed to a seperate region and that everyone interprets things differentlyhttpsenmwikipediaorgwikisanatan_sikhrsanatansikhi
5347	1	obviously what many pakistani dont want to marry indian nationality because pakistani wont get visa to go to india for wedding events vice versa even if same religion seen an engagement start and finish on india pakistan punga second  2 different religions never work  so once again religious or nationality question validation is valid
5348	1	thanks for the advice im gonna give it another try ill try to use a desi brand of coffee i think my main issue is the amount of milk i use maybe i use too much or too little milk do you boil the milk w the decoction or separately maybe that is where im doing it wrong
5349	1	im curious do you have any experience living in or having family living in the uk what you describe is not at all what ive experienced admittedly through the lens of visits and my family there i would also be hard pressed to call america the most diverse nation in the westworld with canada as its neighbour unless youre using diversity to describe something other than multiculturalism
5350	1	shouldve clarified whoops didnt mean forever just until he figures out what he wants to do
5351	1	read again bud outside london ive been to london a dozen times its not representative of the united kingdom at all
5352	1	you described me to a t  throw the fact that i look white into that mix and that is me
5353	1	cool learned something new
5354	1	sounds like a compliment to me thank you
5355	1	self hate and low self esteem coupled with daddy issues
5356	1	gt blacks are a protected class and they cant handle any jokes or criticismbruh shut upgtretarded bruh stfu
5357	1	someday you are maybe going to grow up and realize that racism is not humor
5358	1	my guess is that because punjabi sikh names often have interchangeable first jasdeep hardeep gurdeep sukhdeep and second parts harjas harkirat harpreet harjot some people just attached endings to english names i probably think its as strange as you do theres a police officer in surrey named jenniferjeet
5359	1	aunties have told me worse
5360	1	i dont post on yelp  keep watching babuji  you might learn something
5361	1	these folks were my age or is that not what you mean
5362	1	aww is somebody going to cry i like you didnt even give a rebuttal just a snarky remark take a chill pill
5363	1	nah fuck thattrump is a traitor and must be removed
5364	1	nah i would prefer having a more diverse neighborhood to live in and my kids to grow up in growing up i had korean neighbors italian neighbors indian neighbors lithuanian neighbors and neighbors of every other ethnicity including white neighbors whose families bad been here for generations i played with kids of every ethnicity and ate all these different foods and learned about different cultures and it was great living in a neighborhood that is 95 brown would be extremely limiting culturally and socially
5365	1	dari aw ibarahaet kheli qadim ast
5366	1	opportunist is a better word yes
5367	1	countries have strict food export and import laws for a reason i trust a us multinational open to regulatory scrutiny way more than an opinion of an internet stranger save us all sometime and get over yourself
5368	1	lilly singh is also shitty as fuck nothing she does is any good at all
5369	1	why
5370	1	i wasnt allowed to use the word cancer at home my mom would stop me from talking about it and i was in medical school they want us to become doctors but when it comes to talking about medical issues regarding sex or cancer they balk at the idea
5371	1	the opposite is true huntergatherers were likely more fair skinned than farmers because the former needed to source more vitamin d from the sun at higher latitudes whereas the latter had access to cattle dairy and poultry eggs
5372	1	not judging them only saying that theres been a noticeable hype around them
5373	1	that sub looks like a forum for visa and travel questions not as much fun as the drama filled rabcdesis haha
5374	1	nice way to spin what i said just say youre okay with sexual assault and be done with it
5375	1	a midwestern accent sounds like michael moore or sarah palin speaking it is very similar to the average american accent but the biggest difference is how midwesterners pronounce a in their words
5376	1	are there medical alternatives than using animalsthere are but they dont mimic the complexity of the mammalian body my friend works in cancer research and said there are thousands of papers published yearly that show manipulating protein x or y or giving a drug to increase a protein to cause cell death will help towards curing cancer a lot of this manipulation is done in specialized cells in vitro when they take it to lab mice and rats the effects seen are minimal because there are other underlying factors and complexities that come into play
5377	1	dance isnt that central to some of those cultures i dont even know if my culture has a folk dance loli did raas for 1 year in high school and then joined the bhaangra group in college but it was too cliquey and too much drama so i quit after few months lol
5378	1	yeah we are racist against each other and call hindus and muslims as subhumans so hilarious right
5379	1	ive thought about doing the same for a while now  we used to have a building that could have turned into this kind of center but the older people in the community sold it off
5380	1	gtremember to remove all neck hair boysagreed i try to trim my neck down to a 0 every couple days and totally clean shave it every week or so how do you do it
5381	1	yep  one of the most hilarious misunderstandings ive seen in a while
5382	1	if you dont smell like it though that is just being ignorantracist
5383	1	i didnt ask you to do one thing or another simply told you that you were being whiny because you didnt want to eat a salad when you start acting like a victim who starved himself for most of his life unlike the whites around you yeah youre acting like your life would have been better if you were white sorry dude thats all you i just tell you what i see
5384	1	because youre a halfie who isnt nearly as passing as you want to think and you know that in comparison to a white guy you are just as second rate as a full blooded indian
5385	1	oh shut the fuck up
5386	1	youre slowly becoming my favourite user on this sub
5387	1	oh my god why are all these people so attractivei feel like a walking trash bag
5388	1	i dont think ops post had a negative connotation attached seemed to be more positive than anything tbh hell just be downvoted because people on this sub are very reactionary
5389	1	ive had the opposite experience i often find that desis in small towns are so used to being around nondesis friends dating etc that they take them off the pedestal this problem seems to be more prevalent in people who grew up in enclaves in major diverse cities they often look at nondesis through the same hollywood lens that a lot of foreigners do
5390	1	i stopped using all social media for a few months because i found myself constantly on it i felt so much better because of that but it sucks cuz fb was my only to keep in touch with my relatives in india by seeing their pics and stuff that they posted so i do occasionally go back on it now btw im a girl and i have no time for a bf atm  cuz of the shitload of studying for college i have fucking issues with balancing my life as well lol but i guess ill try to get myself out there more
5391	1	gt these were kids that i used to baby sit but became religious idiotsouch that is is just so sad  just reading that people you treated like baby brothers threatening violence against you
5392	1	yeah my mom had no education her choice so my dad made all my life decisions i wish i was part of your family lol
5393	1	interestingdo you also believe us has the right to be a christian nation like church decides what women do with their bodiesyou are right i trend left politically and i think the separation of church and state was first recorded 500 years ago by machiavelli and we are still stupid for not realizing the importance of it democracy should avoid becoming the autocracy of the majority  francis fukuyama
5394	1	the reason blacks took over popculture is because they where the only minority with significant numbers in the usa where most of the modern development and opportunities arised in the last 50 years or so they are also one of the few minorities along with latinos who prioritize entertainment and sports over academics so its no surprise that these two groups have the most popular social inpact after whites while both of these groups also fail the most in academics i agree with what you said though except about bollywood stars some of the new ones are just as good and cool as the western counterparts john abraham for example is at least as cool masculine and better looking than any black celebrity i can think of tiger shroff is not a good actor but considering guys like mark wahlberg and shia laboef made it big in hollywood i dont see why he couldnt do the same if he got the opportunity vidyut jamwal is as cool as any of the modern action stars in the west
5395	1	rip grammar and sentence construction but you get the drift
5396	1	i like this post despite me not completely agreeing with it i feel like the insecurities are more prominent in those who accuse others of being white washed because theyre ethnocentric and are threatened from outside points of view i completely understand the second part of your post about bitching to white people about your people problem is i feel like the assumption from a lot of folks is that if you say anything bad about desis in a nondesi setting that youre immediately branded as a white worshipper even if that wasnt your intention the melbourne thread not the best example but the one thats most fresh in my mind was somewhat an example of that the outrage came from folks that were upset that the op was a white worshipper because they posted their gripes in the melbourne subreddit i didnt think it was that black and white and i was a bit put off by the insinuation that every sub that isnt 90 desi must be full of only white people yes i think the op was wrong in that thread for the way they presented the issue rather than who they were telling the issue to if that makes any sense so yes and no on the making fun of your culture to get a laugh out of white people yes that its bad and that youre probably looking for acceptance but no that posting issues on other subreddits is white worshipping imo its not about what you do but how you do it to me if youre good enough friends you can make fun of each others culture no holds barred one of my best friends is black and we make such horrible jokes only to each other that we would both be considered as white worshippers by a good chunk of this sub
5397	1	lmao i feel ya man i used to get homeworktests back every tuesday to take home in my folder i always threw away the ones that were below a 95 on my way home yet my mom would still yell at me for not bringing home good grades
5398	1	1 buy a planner and populate it the first weekampx200b2 you should look into your midterms and see what chapters you need to read for each youll find if you start early you really only need to read 23 chapters a week to be done by your midterm season if you plan this all out in your planner from step 1 and stick to it youll actually have less work overallampx200b3 get exercise it helps you concentrateampx200b4 ignore steps 1 2 and 3 because i tell myself im going to do this every fucking semester and always fuck it up give up op studying sucksampx200b

5404	1	gt or perhaps to iran where we can try to track down the descendants of nadir shahnadir shah pillaged it from india  iran is claim is as flimsy as the current british one
5405	1	may be another message to open with like hey was thinking about you how is it going then the rest of the ill be away for a while in case you dont hear from me much but let is catch up once im back been wanting to try that chinese restaurant or on those lines that one sentence is a little too brief but you know the best based on the conversations you have had so far
5406	1	thanks bro really means a lot to me looking forward to living independently
5407	1	so what you tryna say that the queen should return the royal family jewels to each respective country
5408	1	no youre wrong and idiotic to think bollywood has better representation when they literally fetishize whiteness i think you just like how you benefit from misogyny which is much worse in india india is one of the worst places to be a woman i cant take a bigot seriously who undermines the ugly racism that india needs to overcome along with its caste system ask a black person how hard it is thereits simple youre sexist racist and wrong
5409	1	honestly my dad has been amazing he took care of me and my brother while my mom redid residency like i said above my parents and i dont really have a super close or good relationship but i do respect what they did and admire the hell out of them for what they accomplished
5410	1	if anything there is a lot of stuff in bollywood that blatantly disrespects indian culture
5411	1	lol omg youre feelings really are hurt
5412	1	pot kettle black lmao
5413	1	not a fob but if it probably has more to do with the concept of outmarrying rather then which race ufafarog and another user had a good summary of why it has more to do with tribalism and thinking of women as theirs if most desi women were dating black people then most of that group would be against them toothe same principle doesnt apply in reverse for some reason you rarely hear desi women complain that all the men are being taken away by white women we just seem to accept it as a fact and move on
5414	1	no one has the right to their own history history is history it has already happenedwhere did i say that hindus cannot call the subcontinent home
5415	1	oh why not a museum in hyderabad it is fond in deccan region
5416	1	there is no dominant culture of brooklyn brooklyn is everything
5417	1	yeah my experience is that this isnt the case we just dodge the worst of the bullet thanks to the ahmedis and because the aga khan has done a boatload for pakistan at best it is a youre barely muslim but you do good things so we tolerate you kind of policy outside of the countries where the akdn has a presence it is pretty much a blank stare followed by an ugly lookmy favorite interaction was with my arabic language partner a really nice saudi lady who tried to convert me when she found out i was shia then had no idea what ismailis are then asked me if that was anything like a kurd and that kurds deserve to be wiped out and then told me you know too much about religion when i had counters for what she had to say
5418	1	wat
5419	1	who are all these fucked up people saying fucked up shit to each other
5420	1	the question isnt really whether the british were morally superior to the mughals the question is whether or not they actually developed india for the benefit of the subcontinent itself for all their atrocities 90 of which were committed by aurangzeb  the other five were fairly tolerant they built educational systems persianurdu language schools infrastructure and beautified cities in a way that usually benefitted indians if not always indian muslims their capital was circulated within india to build up indian cities indian wealth and indian industry the british plundered far more wealth from the subcontinent  and redistributed it within england and colonies like canadaaustralia mughals may have slaughtered hindussikhs destroyed temples etc but the wealth that they plundered or received as tribute was of a smaller scale than the british and purely circulated within india on top of that the muslim rulers of india were usually indian themselves the mughals and even the delhi sultans had significant rajput or otherwise south asian ancestry to the point where they were far more indian than they were central asian or persian
5421	1	yeah shes not desi but shes based and bhagwa pilled
5422	1	what are brahmincal politics and what is wrong with saying advances can be traced back to a hindu
5423	1	i think it is far more unhealthy to raise a child in an unhappy marriage rather than divorcing and raising your child in separate households not to label all indian households like this or say everyone in this subreddit is indian but dont one in three indian women face physical or sexual violence at home
5424	1	ive never been to that sub but i feel like in order to make your point valid you would have to 1 define abuse and 2 explain why it is a direct result of them being desi and how if they were white it would suddenly not be an issue until then i would assume that many of the users on that subreddit are going through that teenage phase where you hate your parents but because theyre desi they assume their issues with their parents are because theyre desi id also argue that the majority of desis are happy with their parents so to insinuate that white parents are universally better or  isuperior would be an exaggeration to say the least
5425	1	lol i didnt think it was that rare to most of us a sexy abcd guy is basically one thats funnyhas a great personality charming smile and confidence i guess preference for physical characteristics depends on the girl dad bods and the fuckboycurly hair seem to be in high demand you guys are overthinking this imo
5426	1	same in any other indian city although i thought delhi was the absolute worst
5427	1	by that logic cultures can never develop and change internally who gets to say what indian culture is and what standards need to be conserved considering how diverse india is im curious to how anyone can say that there is one unique indian culture what gives anyone the power to be a gatekeeper by that logic you may as well get rid of democratic government and go back to being ruled by kings
5428	1	i feel personally attacked by this comment
5429	1	agreed ill never fully understand the desi obsession with fair skin but genetic studies show it is been going on for millenia thousands of years it is time to stop now whether or not a person is sexy desirable charismatic successful or a good partner has nothing to do with the specific shade of their skin ffs
5430	1	are you really this dense every major culture has a status driven mentality its nothing particulary desi about it
5431	1	desis are the most discriminated group lmao
5432	1	im literally crying jesus yall are wrong
5433	1	i mean neither of those sound enjoyable
5434	1	throwback to the indian girl in raustralia who curves indian guys

5443	1	tell that to the people commenting here even the most unbiased indian sources tend to skew antipakistan and vice versa the only difference is that there is more scrutiny in the latter over here
5444	1	southerneuropeans mediterraneans and sometimes middleeasterns think italians greeks turks lebanese etc it is a racial slur used against these ethnicities since they were later arrivals to australia in contrast to the original angloceltic settlers
5445	1	i dont think they have the worst chanceas long as they have the grades they will get in somewhere ivy leagues arent the end all be all there are many successful people who havent gone to iviesmexicans are still underrepresented in colleges even with affirmative action in place asians on the other had are actually overrepresented relative to how many asiansmexicans there are in the us
5446	1	never happens in indiaoh please stop the lies no im being real well it was probably a combination of being unlucky and meeting mostly shitty people i didnt display superiority they did
5447	1	hi i didnt know there were sfsu students on thi sub
5448	1	maybe they are trying to be progressive with uniting different religions and stuff but they kinda screwed up cause those are two last names lmao
5449	1	the origins of the word as very different from what it has now come to mean see httpsenmwikipediaorgwikibhakti_movement
5450	1	other nonwhite groups enslaved millions of other races and moved them across oceans to enslave them and their off spring for hundreds of years other nonwhite groups colonized europe plundered them of their resources other nonwhite groups stole land from other groups and then implemented apartheid like systems to deprive their own citizens of benefits purely because of their race south africa and usother nonwhite groups elected someone like trump who is openly racist and hostile against nonwhite people where is the antiwhite leader of a nonwhite country
5451	1	i dont think it is that unpopular this is reddit a largely reactionary space where people are afraid of sex it is 2018 idk get on tinder bang it out with a stranger feel the tension evaporate it is not that hard to do
5452	1	agreed
5453	1	the h1b issue is absolutely about providing cheap indentured labour visa holders are tied to their sponsoring employer and must appeal to be allowed to seek other employment norm matloff of uc davis has literally been trying to expose this for decades with little luckhttpwebcsucdavisedumatloffh1bhtmlhttpwebcsucdavisedumatloffh1b10minhtml

5456	1	check your messages
5457	1	i find the jump to this answer quite hasty lol we dont even know how solid of a relationship it is to just throw away your family like that
5458	1	a karmabhoomi is literally where you work and where you serve the community and where you find yourself so of course it is entirely possible that a karmabhoomi is where one hasnt yet lived but plans to especially given op is so young
5459	1	gt im not saying that the uk deserves to have it but i dont consider it to be a big dealwho the fuck made you the authority  these were stolen plain amp simple they ought to return it to their original landsgt give all the greek statues back to greece roman statues to italy egyptian mummies to egypt well yes they should begt have fun with thatwe will
5460	1	or perhaps more likely people in canada stick to a colonial perspective on things edit im not aware of anyone else that uses the term to describe india ive never seen it in german for instance
5461	1	you just contradicted yourselfif fob doesnt refer to desis only it is inherently not racist because it applies to multiple taxes and therefore it is not racistunless you want to bend what the term racist means
5462	1	because genius in india you dont go by the info you get on a call even from a major company you are clearly not able to help so why bother tiring yourself tapping keys sitting in your ac room in some american suburb
5463	1	she is from bradford yorkshire not newcastletyneside
5464	1	stovetop pressure cookers are much better nowadays they often have a variable valve so they dont let out pressure in a large loud gush id strongly recommend one to someone who wants something faster probably easier to clean and much more durablemy parents have an instant pot and it is great for incubating yogurt or something cant really safely leave a stove on
5465	1	gtwell socioeconomic and religious stratification exist in other places toothe whole point is that caste is still a big deal in economic social and cultural circles now even in the us in the desi social circles in college grad school and the professional world a lot of people discreetly ask about caste if it isnt obvious from last name and subtly observe caste lines there arent that many intercaste friendships or relationships especially ones where it is more than one level apartat the same time my european husband is last name and now part of mine literally means one the lowcaste occupations there is been no sense of shame or stigma about it for as far back as one can remember and the family has been upwardly mobile middleuppermiddle class for literally centuries the name is a nonissue and i only think about it with this articlethe point isnt that discrimination by ancestral occupation didnt exist in europe it is more that they got their shit together on this particular problem and now we need to and we can only get our shit together if we admit the problem rather than engage in whataboutism and excusesthere is other articles on the site where there is similar reasoning about how indians treat women is rights yes we didnt invent oppressing women but we have some issues about how we treat women so let is get out in front of it rather than giving excuses
5466	1	isnt deepika padukone the biggest star though nowadays and she is dark skinned

5469	1	also its ok if he doesnt want to its entirely unfair to force this on him
5470	1	this is a terrible idea you got ghosted move on
5471	1	christmas is a religious and cultural holiday people are celebrating the cultural holiday its not a mystery in any way shape or form this sub is so negative sometimes
5472	1	unsurprisingly the pedophiles in question are muslim  so of course indians are pouncing on it
5473	1	i literally used the rating from the app store found in all android or iphone devices you live in india dont you i cant take you seriously after you talked about your elite university circle and only dating after you have a career that is not an american thought process and incongruent with what people think here white people and other races have zero problems dating as early as middle school even the ones who end up in  good colleges the only dating after having a job is a purely indian thought and thus you are unable to relate most people who say that here say it because they are unable to physically attract someone without the backup of a good career which might be your case women in colleges especially care little about a career in that stage  also you believe there is less sexual abuse in india than in america or australia which again is laughable and further devalues your opinionsyou know nothing about columbia youve never been there and dont know anyone who goes there your analysis of theyre too focused on studying and dont take care of themselves is again laughableof course i can pick apart how you incorrectly analyzed the study but ill just leave it here you still think first met is a good or even remotely popular dating app which further proves you dont live in america or maybe even uk and have zero experience in trying to date which you have admittedi just looked it up and firstmer is literally an app designed for people 35 wow how useless
5474	1	the conversation never came up in ours thankfully my family was against it at first because hes punjabi and were gujarati but that went away when they met him
5475	1	apparently the person above you doesnt know what heshe talking about
5476	1	when in doubt whip it out
5477	1	aw man do your friends not celebrate either maybe spend it with them instead
5478	1	i already am even though i live with them im pretty distance to most of my family dont even have a lot of friends because they all moved on
5479	1	thanks this makes most sense to me  buying a house is so much work   cant wait to have my own place plus i can get a cat and a dog haha
5480	1	gt
5481	1	this sub while containing the term american is for anyone who is a part of the desi diaspora including canada and europeyoure all welcomed
5482	1	well there is always the issue of just bc it is being discussed in academia how helpful is it if it is not getting to practioners i work in social services so i always feel frustrated by the inaccessibility of good research good luck with your thesis
5483	1	yup i hate when indian family always make remarks about shit im buying with my own money like bro you didnt spend 1 cent on my new car that is just a base model nissan cause i only need it to get from point a to b yet you talking shit cause it is not a mercedes or bmw or whatever else costs too much money for me to spend ill definitely be in the same situation as you for housing soon probably wont even bother inviting ppl over lol
5484	1	bro lets be real why would you want to start dating someone across the country have fun being text buddies and then realizing youher will be dropping a couple hundred buck to just meet for a first date
5485	1	haaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahahaha oh my god this sounded like a comedy sketch scene lol still i feel bad for that kid
5486	1	gtwhite hollywood celebrity thoughampx200bbut he is not really this i dont think he is relevant at all i think soulja boy is more relevant

5488	1	httpimgurcomanra2wguhere is mine lol proof that race transcends looks i would say im around 5610 but no results
5489	1	saw i kinda looked over it again most looks redacted and i really dont know what to make out of it i feel if this is a big story that the major outlets will pick it up
5490	1	19 is old enough to be considered first gen i mean technically it is always first gen but i like to differentiate between first gen 125 15 175 i know it seems crazy to go to such depths but it helps to know where you belong in the grand scheme in relation to other migrants and their ancestors a 1st gen may create a topic and go over the heads of 2nd gen and viceversa additionally a 15 gen relates to both sides but not 100 etc
5491	1	gtare you referring to immigrant desis or desis brought up abroad this normally would apply to immigrants however i dont see many abcd is doing this even if they marry within the same communityim talking about desis brought up abroad but i see what youre saying since most if not all abcds speak english to each other regardless of community but assuming both know how to speak the language well it is possible that they may make some effort to pass on language but probably not to the extent that immigrant parents do
5492	1	coming from a stranger might not mean much  but im seriously proud of you for coming out relatively sane and still talking to your parents
5493	1	people thought you had to be white until obama won also the republican candidate against obama the 2nd time  was mormon they technically arent christians
5494	1	yup
5495	1	this is even in delhi my mom was just there like 6 months ago and she said it was bad she wouldnt even go outside at night after like 7 and she grew up there my sister wanted to travel there this coming summer with a college friend both under 21 but now its basically off the books
5496	1	find a popular hobby amongst the desi community like garba events my guy

5498	1	bruh same my mom says that
5499	1	he says hes such a good cuddler too oof i want him so so soooo bad im not the type of gal to do the lovey dovey crap but with him i want that apparently the date is practically all day so i better whoop out and show him my entire city i dont want sex with him i want something more i want a relationship with him hes my dream man but i cant have him now im ok with that too i think he was meant to come in my direction for a reason he is almost a sign of hope for me
5500	1	i wouldnt hate it if i didnt have my reasons
5501	1	outlet
5502	1	prince andrew was another big one
5503	1	this sub hates sikhs if were being really real it is super obvious it is predominantly a hindu sub that frequently gets brigaded by rindia which is a largely reactionary sub
5504	1	yes but as i said other countries have advantages over usa as well and other countries have faults some may favour a free healthcare scheme for example
5505	1	trying to find that bad boy on limewire was the bane of my existence
5506	1	truth
5507	1	i am willing to bet you or someone you are close to is in the restaurant industry and my post hit a nerve no other reason i  see for you to defend against my argument so strongly stooping to personal insults i am sorry i hurt your sensitivities actually im not idgaf what you think
5508	1	not wrong
5509	1	thanks for this rec will look into it what did you especially like about it
5510	1	yo white dude here who knows both hindi and urdu  women arent necessarily better with languages  id love to raise my kids knowing the languages due to my great respect for south asian culture  which is a concern when dating most nondesis and even abds to a degree  so pros and cons but definitely raise your kids with the language  and teach them the script too
5511	1	gt nah for real im done i have an interview peacegood luck with your interview strong hand shake maintain eye contact when speaking be cognizant of keeping a confident posture chest wide shoulders relaxed when they ask you questions regarding your previous experience use i statements and not we statements believe that they need you more than you need them while still coming off as likable you got this
5512	1	hehehehonestly it was hard for me to press on and care i lost my grittiness
5513	1	im not saying that anyone should be forced to celebrate christmas i just think that there is nothing wrong with doing sowhen i was at school we did all kinds of christmas related activities there like secret santa and singing christmas carols it is definitely an integral part of the culture here we did not celebrate it at home though other kids would ask me hey dude what did you get for christmas i didnt have any shared experiences with them so i felt somewhat alienated
5514	1	never give up on yourself keep going even when it hurts to try  just keep at it youre very welcome and if you need to chat lmk
5515	1	thank you for your service
5516	1	oh sorry for late reply yea im bengali christian was born in dhaka  um i came at a young age so i havent really experienced the whole bengali culture but overall i speak bangla had some desi friends indian bengali and some pakistani overall i do love my culture i used to eat lot of fish and rice but now i only cook western food like pizza meatloaf fried chicken fried fish etc i abstain from pork though i love us and i love bangladesh also
5517	1	because aib makes content for indians alone
5518	1	i didnt have a specific setting in mind but im not about to force some poor girl on her morning commute or grocery run to endure another dude trying to make innocent conversationso probably a mixer or museum or bookstore or something
5519	1	i think violence could play a factor but im willing to take a few blows if that means they can release some preliminary negative feelings they might have due to shock thank you for your words i will keep them in mind as i do this
5520	1	i wonder what sense of accomplishment or fulfillment you receive from being insensitive to the plight of others and then going the extra mile to ridicule them when theyre only asking for a little support last i checked cannabis is still a substance which can cause a dependence on it by the user if that isnt addiction i dont know what is
5521	1	httpsyoutubeermlobfzpmkshe is a pakistani rapper
5522	1	theres a significant difference between how desi parents view their son marryingdating outside of their own race and their daughters doing the same
5523	1	i feel for your sister its so so hard i saw many friends both male and female go through this nonsense with their parents the melodrama was unreal of course im not saying that parents are bad or whatever but ultimately i cannot tolerate guilt tripping your kids for this it seems very selfish i always tell myself to never do this to my kids whenif they go down that road
5524	1	correct me if im wrong but didnt all the stuff that the girl was talking about happen to her while in melbourne i personally didnt think her posting it there was a big deal especially since her experiences actually happened there
5525	1	damn that sounds awesome solo backpacking part why dont you try something more serious like shaadi one of my girls met a great guy there and just got married not all girls are like that

5531	1	hey man stats are stats numbers dont lie however the extrapolation thereof is where disagreements happen and thats okay people are allowed to have opinions as long as they arent hurting anyone
5532	1	gt i say that the history of the subcontinent is a diversity and mixture of cultures and religionsi agreegtno one religion owns the histroy i agreegtislam doesnt belong in the subcontinent historywhether it belongs there or not is besides the point everybody has a right to their beliefs and history gtand many are actively taking measure to erase it from the countryi think this is badgtthe oldest segments of dna came from africa anthroplogically and genetically the out of africa theory is the one most widely accepted out of people who understand and have studied it yah and the first place where man settled for an extensivelong periods of time outside of the initial migration from africa was the india subcontinent but again where can dharmic religionshindus call home

5536	1	a symptom of it
5537	1	not reaching for anything its clear people over index on tall good looking black guys when they think about dating idris elba is not the typical black dude an asian dude that was his height and build would likely do just as fine and probably have access to girls who would not consider a black dude sure there are girls seeking out that type but an average black dude will get turned away from the club to preserve the ratio these studies below are not perfect but they are representative and show a consistent patternhttpstheblogokcupidcomraceandattraction20092014107dcbb4f060httpsqzcom149342theuncomfortableracialpreferencesrevealedbyonlinedating
5538	1	truthit is not true that the fobs are individual actors they share this attitude towards abcds i mean they share it with other fobs who look or do things differenti hosted a student for a few weeks he paid nothing and i didnt ask him anything  he was a student he ate our food drank our beer and at one point he told me that i am not indian if i dont speak hindi it wasnt enough that i was willing to let a completely random stranger crash in my place i have had the same experiences as the two other people in the sub fobs being super shitty when your other race so is hanging out with you all ugh
5539	1	i feel you im fiji indian
5540	1	what is wrong with aryan
5541	1	harsh but true lets be real were on reddit most if not all the desi guys i know that are successful romantically have barely heard of it much less some obscure south asian subreddit
5542	1	this is the same argument people used about kavanaugh
5543	1	indian men whine about it the least because you are the one doing all the whining for them
5544	1	to be honest my fob friends are more guilty of this it seems to have caught on to abcds taco bell being a favorite for some garbage reason there is hundreds of better mexican food places in the bay area especially the more mexican hole in the wall places the only reason they dont go there is because they have some kind of antimexican racist prejudice in their brains it is like theyre implicitly scared of mexicans as if all of them are criminals or somethingampx200balso im often stereotyped as being an fob miser or something because i dont like apple watches and wasting my money on a new iphone every year it is not because im foby it is because i believe in rfinancialindependence yet when it comes to food taco bell is better than other mexican places because it is cheap i dont even
5545	1	which is somewhat weird because as a desi who grew up in india and did his undergrad in an indian college i find people around me _love marrying_ all the timea couple of them have even been interreligious and it is usually not that big of a deal id expect parents living in the us to be more liberal lolto be fair most of them dont give their parents regular updates on their dating life  they just tell them if things are serious and theyre thinking about marrying
5546	1	i would say confidence makes a big difference too no one wants to be with someone who is always projecting insecurity to them personalityattitude and confidence can take you far
5547	1	the guys are idiots too gt also from what i know about billywood unmarried women are more desired than married women not sure how her marrying a gora is going to raise her value in an industry that favors young and unmarried womenand she is getting older like i said this is shortterm desperationshe is naturally going to fade away just like kajol rani preity but this was one last desperate gasp id laugh my arse off if she doesnt get a big bwhw project in the next 2 years
5548	1	it is not indentured servitude but it is not all happy either which is why some people are moving away to canada where the salaries are usually lower than the us so if someone is taking a paycut and moving to a different country leaving all their old connections here dont you think that there is something not working for them heregt there is space for empathy and there is a lot to go around especially within the desi community who are aware of the challenges of immigration in the united states but maybe the exaggerations with things like using the phrase indentured servitude needs to be toned down if the issues is to be addressedthey were toned down all these years and no one gave a shit the problem kept becoming worse which is why people are speaking out more now i dont think people who didnt give a shit before would start giving a shit if you spoke less about the issuegt what you are referring is not unique to h1b thoughwhat is unique to h1b is that you would get deported on top of getting fired getting fired is fine but getting deported is not fine for many peoplegt and if you could humor me on these talking points about the h1b visa again one of the most highly compensating professional class in the uswhat is the point of mentioning that h1bs are highly compensated the resent is not because of low wages it is because they are being treated differently and crappily compared to every other nationality who is in the same position as them ie a british software engineer or a canadian software engineergt so this idea that people dont change jobs seems weirdthat is not what i said i said people shy away from risky jobs that they would have otherwise taken because of restrictions imposed by h1bs there is a difference between not being able to take risky jobs and not changing jobsgt the wives are aware of this restriction before getting marriedthe wait period in 20079 was probably 56 years it is more than 60 years now for some categories so no they are not aware of this nor could they have predicted this when they marriedgt and there are innovative ways to get around this restriction as done by many wives of the tech professionals it is america there are ways around if you have the will to do itmost of them are probably illegal if you know of a legal innovative way that works for most people then i would like to hear itgt and there are several organizations where the wives of indian tech workers volunteer their time for no money i have seen this in san joseseattleaustin areasyou cannot simply volunteer for any position you can only volunteer for it if that position would never be a paid position ie they will never hire another paid employee for it if you dont take it that makes sense but that also means that you cannot volunteer hoping that an employer likes you enough to go to the trouble of filing a h1b for you so the bar for entry is very high for people in non tech fields
5549	1	it is not so much justification as it is context the idea that the social progress made in the west developed in a vacuum needs to be squashed especially when the west rarely adheres to that morality when it deals with people outside of its bordersit also provides hope hope that as global income equalizes new nations will begin to let go of those traditionally regressive ways of thinking
5550	1	same thing my parents heard george bush sr talking about what a bad influence the show was so we were not allowed to watch it we could still watch married with children though

5553	1	if it pakistan was a superpower countries wud have lined up to give it money in return for some favors usa doesnt go around begging for money china doesnt need the same they get their way and bully others into submission thats superpower not some country where islamist mob brings the country to halt openly goes against the counrt rules country is begging for just 23 billions pm is making round to different countries investments are dying a countrys biggest assets are it is people and how it can use them but pakistan has like 60 literacy rate 40 pakistanis are just good for menial jobs as labor cleaners construction workers look at china in comparison its students are over running the top universities they will build a strong country with major industries unicorn startups that other countries will fear to spoil their relationship with china because their major trade investment will depend on them just like pakistan falls in line behind china idk why am i even arguing with a deluded idiot who thinks capacity to destroy the world makes you a superpower as if any country will survive after nuking even a small town pakistan or even india doesnt have the guts to point their nuclear weapons at america being a superpower usa will take it as a hostile act and throw your country in chaos by cutting of trade links of invading it or making canada eu nation is boycott all links with your country enough of educating you for today i have not got more time to waste who keeps derailing the conversation by bringing india my applications hindu muslim drama in between and thinks capacity to destroy the world makes one superpower  but does not know what superpower means and why usa has got more might than pakistan in the world hint hint it has got something to do with being world superpower

5566	1	gt the only reason they dont go there is because they have some kind of antimexican racist prejudice in their brainshave you considered maybe taco bell is more welcoming and comfortable because of clearly listed menus and more likely to have a fluent english speaking staff also a consistent menu going to other mexican places requires experimentation and stuff

5574	1	i know about the genocides and yeah there is a sphere of influence the uk hadhas over the us which causes racism against us institutionally and socially  but the other groups i mentioned have much more deep and ingrained racism against them in the us because the genocide of native americans and enslavement of africans were what the us was built on

5582	1	i was talking about being extra about it i go to christmas dinners all the time because that is what neighbors do i think it is a waste of time and money for muslim desi family to have a tree in their house visiting santa and all that other crap huge differenceit is insulting because participating in this contributes to the despiritualisation and secularization of christmas where the emphasis is less about jesus as and more about santa and shopping which is what is happening i would hate it if eid or ramadan started to become that  i mean it already is starting to why would i contribute to that if i dont want my religious holidays going the same waybesides the more islamic thing to do would be to actually work during the holidays so that the christian coworkers could spend the day with their families instead of having to work when i worked in retail a lot of us muslims and non christians would take the holiday shifts so that could happen during christmas most of the doctors and nurses working at the area hospitals arent christian for the same reason lol
5583	1	it is none of those it is gang culture in the uk and most of the gangsters of pakistani descent happen to be from mirpur mirpur itself isnt this bad how this particular gang culture started in the uk and not anywhere else pakistanis went is a long discussion

5599	1	very true i dont talk about american politics because i dont fit with either party republicans and democrats both seem racist to indians
5600	1	gtanother dynamic to consider is that the more indians that come here the more ethnic enclaves there are i used to live in one and i saw that it was much easier for desi parents to enforce a lot of the things my parents tried on me when the majority of the community shares your values we left that community right around the time kids started high school so dont know if these desi kids ended up pushing back against their parents restrictionsampx200bthey are probably living a double life at home they are idealizing and confining to the expectations of their parents outside at school and away they are you typical american teenager secretly dating pre marital sex etc so lives in a heavy indian community but his family is not very involved thankfully and expresses this among what he has seen among his friends who have very strict parents they are two different people in two different places ampx200balso read this post from a multilingual blog there was an indian lady who asked the blogger how to keep kids in her culture because they are getting too americanized despite being part of a large indian communityhttpsmultilingualparentingcom20181129qapassonheritagelanguageandculturetonextgenerationhttpsmultilingualparentingcom20181129qapassonheritagelanguageandculturetonextgenerationampx200bwhat the blogger says is true you can never expect your children to carry and hold on to the values that you expect of them them especially if they are living and associating with people from different culturesbackgrounds they will confine to values you expect of them at home but when they are on their own and have their own kids you will see their true valuesampx200b

5640	1	you can go a lot further and here is largely where the philosophies of right and left wing diverge the left wing considers an inclusive culture to be a priority on the same pedestal as fundamental human rights whereas for the right wing freedom of religion and no dejure discrimination is enough ignoring extremistsif india has to define a popular culture for itself a few facts cant be ignored1 india is gt 70 hindu and will remain so for the foreseeable future2 islam and christianity are not native to indian soil3 in particular conservative islam with its massive prohibitions on idol worship and its rigid rules on who enters heaven and who does not is not all that compatible with a majority hindu society  jinnah agreed with metherefore a genuine grassroots indian nationalism will be centered around hinduism this might make muslims and christians from india feel left out but that is life this is largely the point where people on the left get uncomfortable but its not necessarily bad us popular culture is largely centered around christianity and hindus are the highest earning demographic jewish americans seem to have done very well for themselves as long as equality of opportunity is ensured the popular culture can leave groups outampx200b
5641	1	just having a joke its exams forgive me

5665	1	the existence of trust fund babies arent a proof against capitalism wealth disparity and i think you obliquely hinted at the tragedy of the commons in another comment are real problems that do exist in the current model but anarchocapitalism does address those issues at length if you get the chance you should head over to rgoldandblack  and read what milton friedman and murray rothbard have to say on the philosophy ussr and nk were meant to be extreme examples of the failures of socialism the socdem nordic model countries youre mentioning were successful prior to implementing the welfare state and are very small countries in terms of population meaning the burden on providing welfare entitlement programs healthcare to a neet population are much much smaller than a country like the us or india not to mention they consistently rank in the top 10 of all countries in terms of economic freedomthe issues youve raised are very complex problems and deserve a better treatment than a few lines from me but suffice to say there are economists smarter than you or i who do believe in the merits of an ancap model keep an open mind is all i ask

5717	1	id be happy too if you like
5718	1	nope i am saying youll find a more open support for their views especially online as they outnumber every other group and have hold over most socioeconomic structures they will also come out in numbers to show their righteous indignation if you compare them to the american republicans and call them out additionally many of them in the states will vote for the dems while having no cognitive dissonance and fund the bjp in india so if this gets more visibility prepare to be downvoted en masse
5719	1	yes theyre not used in day to day practice but that still doesnt mean there arent alternatives that exist and should be explored google for example has begun research into vr as a pain management tool and there is a great amount of research as to nonvisual and verbal pain assessment indicators the fact that something is the current standard absolutely shouldnt mean it must continue that way we should encourage alternatives especially where there is a crisis like here the gist of the problem the article is highlighting is the fact that the medical student wrote an order for it which is still problematic fda reduction of acetaminophen content in opioids hasnt solved the problem not sure if youre in canada or the us but there is literally a public health crisis of opioid misuse overdose and paths to heroin addiction im not saying everyone can do what they want the problem is the autonomy to practice in an evidencebased manner is based in part on a lack of comprehensive education of physicians on pain management that is not to say all doctors are uneducated on the issues but the amount of times ive come across doctors prescribing 100 200 300x the maximum morphine equivalent dosage to a patient is astonishing im on a statebased opioid epidemic task force
5720	1	exactly my thoughts on it as well sometimes you shouldnt judge a movie based on the inherent artistic quality of it but rather with the love passion and energy that went into it and it is clear that where is the party yaar had all those three it is a kinda dumbbad movie but everyone has a lot of fun making it and it is a fun movie overall that i still love italso nice  username

5726	1	what is the setting
5727	1	lol okay that makes sense he called me a hardline hindu nationalist and i am like the hell dude is probably upset he couldnt be kashmiri haha what a loser
5728	1	what does wog mean in this context
5729	1	gtisnt that a wrong comparison though shouldnt you be comparing single canadian workers with the single immigrant workersno because that is exactly a scenario that is happening to canadian workers everyone gets hit by wages going down some more than othersibm canada is the legal name across the country there should be limits on hiring foreign workers if a canadian cannot be found and a base salary structure across the industry  if companies want to onshore talent they should be prepared to pay a premium on that talent instead of giving them peanuts and driving down conditions for alli have no problem with skilled immigrants coming here but everyone should be paid fairly and not exploited so some execs at the top can hoard cash
5730	1	programmers are as poor as taxi drivers

5733	1	nah hoejabi is a term for a reason sexual repression in muslim desi society doesnt mean that people are more virtuous theyre just screwing where no one can see
5734	1	gt she is a neoliberal are you serious do you even look up the terminology that you use or do you just blindly toss it in because it sounds like a suitably negative connotation to associate with a figure that you dont like regardless of whether it actually appliesaccording to wikipedianeoliberalism or neoliberalism1 is the 20thcentury resurgence of 19thcentury ideas associated with laissezfaire economic liberalism27 those ideas include economic liberalization policies such as privatization austerity deregulation free trade3 and reductions in government spending in order to increase the role of the private sector in the economy and societyseeing as everything she says is the exact opposite of this i think it is safe to say that the tag doesnt apply to herdo yourself a favor and look up the big fancy words that you toss around why is that so hard sheeshgtwho has decided to support bernie because it gets her cloutand you know that how exactly because you heard it somewheregtif you are pro russiaoh my god are you kidding me do you seriously think that russia fighting actual goddam terrorists should be painted as a negative thing just because it is russiai gotta ask at this point do you even bother to think for yourself because that is not what im seeing here
5735	1	some people use specific symbols for disambiguating sounds that would ordinarily have the same orthographic representation in tamil especially for loanwords from foreign languages or even from devanagari script kkʰgɡʱ as you mentioned that use voiced versions of consonants whereas the written form of modern tamil uses an implicit unvoiced consonant even if voiced when spoken i personally am a fan of this because it lets me better understand how to pronounce certain words it is also not too much of a hassle as tamil is already fairly regular as far as abugidas goi dont think that your comparison between modern tamil and simplified chinese is quite accurate though while classical tamil is certainly different from modern tamil in terms of flexible syntax and semantics the orthography is mostly unchanged otoh while traditional chinese is virtually identical to classical chinese simplified chinese introduced a series of principled orthographic changes so that the language is easier to read and write in smaller printif you look at pictureshttpsuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsffchistory_of_tamil_scriptjpg of tamil since the 15th century ce youll see that the script is pretty much unchanged between the modern era and the previous one the primitive forms of the modern characters  dating back to the first few centuries ce  are much more comparable to something like bone script or seal script as far as primitive ancient chinese writing systems go there is no substantial simplification from the traditional form of tamil 15th century ce to the modern form either natural or maninducededit the addition of marker symbols for voicingetc in some forms of modern written tamil is much more similar to how the post1900 japanese syllabaries work eg the _dakuten_ marks to indicate voicing and _handakuten_ marks for semivoicing it is not so much a simplification as it is a delineation of context however unlike japanese modern tamil does not require these markers most forms of written tamil still use context to suggest when a word uses a voiced consonant rather than an unvoiced one and some speakers may not voice a consonant at all in certain contexts
5736	1	i dont know how hard is it for you to understand  the majority of kashmiris are muslims and the majority of muslim kashmiris want independence therefore the majority of kashmiris want independence do you not get that it is called deductive reasoninghttpsenwikipediaorgwikideductive_reasoning you hold the opinion of what most hindu kashmiris hold it is a minority opinion lol  your attempt to divide kashmiris along sectarian lines even shias want indepdences ever heard of the author mirza waheed he is shia and in favor of separatismampx200bfirst thing is as a person of pakistani origin is call out your  government for allowing non kashmiris to settle in azad kashmirlmao this shows how little you know of azad jammu and kashmiri ajk  pakistanis are not legally allowed to buy land in ajk or even gilgit the vast majority of people there are natives to that land i keep hearing indians mentioning how punjabis are settling there lmaoo the people of ajk speak pahari and it is been that since even before partition that like saying nonkashmiris shouldnt settle the indianside of jammu azad kashmir was previously known as poonch and the people there were never koshur ethnically even their castes are more similar to castes in jammu they speak a similar dialect and wear similar clothes if you didnt know koshur people are only native to the valley ajk was never the valley  secondly im an american so my government isnt the pakistani govtsecondly call out a balochistan referendum to show good faith and  that you can walk the walk also maybe call out their closest ally in  that they literally put muslims in camps to reeducate them but you  wont a hear that from pakistanlmfaoo you know what is that called it is a logical fallacy called whataboutismhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiwhataboutism  what does the baloch issue or what is happening in china have anything to do with what were discussing right now it is just a detraction if it makes you happy ill let you know that im totally in favor of baloch and uighurs deciding their own future you assume i must condone what theyre going through just cause i support kashmiri independence if india can support bengalis to create their own country no reason why they cant let kashmiris do the sameampx200bampx200b
5737	1	gti have no problem with skilled immigrants coming here but everyone should be paid fairly and not exploitedi think everyone is in agreement on this part and on this issue of immigrantion overall the problem is the focus on the rhetoric of immigrant worker stealing jobs from canadians why do you think people are find it easier to focus on immigrant worker rather than employer and labor regulations are labor regulations too complex to understand or criticizing employers is considering going against capitalism and also again on the issue of foreign workers in tech industry how are highly paid workers exploited they are compensated higher than average wages they are free to choose different jobs if they want
5738	1	stop acting stupid that isnt good for a 35 year old man lmaoo you have multiple accounts on here on this account you claim to be a kashmiri pandit on another lambdax now deleted youve claimed to be a malyalee hindu then youve pretended to be both a kashmiri muslim and bunch of other ethnic groups youve deleted your other accounts but even the mods on here and other subs are aware of your trollingi get downvoted from you and your nationalist buddies that brigade this sub

5742	1	i dont think it is an old generation thing at all i have extremely strict indian parents and plan on running away from home soon and cutting off contact with my parents i have some online friends from india and also a few indianamerican friendsthere is the stark difference between how the indians from india view my situation and how indianamericans doindianamericans completely agree that i should leave home and cut off all contact with my parents indians from india mostly think i am a bad person for doing so theyre like your parents probably have your best interest in mind you should just try to sit down and talk to them dont run away this applies to all age groupsi also have some older relatives who are indianamericans they moved to the us at a very young age and grew up here in the 1960s and 70s if i were to ask them how i should handle my situation with my parents they would absolutely agree that i should leave and cut off all contact whereas none of the indian people who moved here from india would agree with that

5746	1	only reason i even know about this conspiracy theory is because people often accuse me of it i personally wouldnt have gotten involved with someone who wasnt muslim when i met them that is what i recommend to everybody as well islamically it isnt right for someone to convert just for marriage conversion should only be due to conviction and belief that being said i think muslims are being accused of love jihad wrongly islamically a marriage isnt valid if a male marries someone who isnt of the people of the book which means the couple is living in sin i suspect that is what is happening young guys and girls get involved with out thinking about the consequences hormones do that to people haha by the time they fall in love and think about marriage the muslim guy faces this problem of nikah not being valid i personally know a few guys who ended their relationships because marriage wasnt psossible there are bound to be some that will ask the girl if she wants to convert for marriage i dont think this happens due to sinister intentions
5747	1	yeah but it is cheaper and more beneficial to marry a star than to invest 1 million in eb5

5752	1	there are bad and misogynistic people in every culture historically there have been more of these types of people in abrahamic cultures than there have been in hinduism youre acting like somehow the state of the caste system in indian culture is worse than the segregation and lack of women is rights that western countries had up until the 1970s im sure there is people you care about that have been affected by racismmisogyny of westerners you cant pin this regressive mentality on an entire culture pinning it on your own culture over every other culture makes you self hating

5760	1	welfare is given to those that are deemed to be in poverty its a minimum level subsidy thats supposed to keep people afloat no one is supposed to survive on welfare alone those communities do support each other and starting a business takes a lot of money which most of them dont have what they probably need is a culture shift to one that prioritizes education over quitting school and working and not having kids until youre well past the poverty line have you seen those kids theyre literally starving in the streets or in shittier situations being forced to beg for money as part of a shitty business ya i hope people here arent gonna be put in the same situation gt of course im not saying let people starve completely to deathgt not everyone will make it obviouslydo you see how these are contradictory you want to reduce welfare to motivate them with an added twist of danger which sounds a lot like starvation people on welfare have jobs man and very few of them are addicts the issue is most of the jobs they can get with a geddiploma are low wage ones theres keeping them in poverty
5761	1	not sure what youre referring to but we remove all articles that dont have anything to do with the desi diaspora or are strictly about a religious community as those belong in subreddits more appropriatesome may slip through the cracks but were pretty diligent in removing them as soon as they come to our attention

5766	1	well for any jews to make aaliyah to israel including bnei menashe they must convert to orthodox judaism meaning denouncing jesus as their messiah im not sure if rabbis main focus in to convert them back to judaism from christianity considering most rabbis would directly tell you they are not allowed to convert anybody same thing happened to ethiopian jews i heard they were brought up as orthodox christians but in order to be part of judah family they have to convert to orthodox judaism ethiopian jews are from tribe of dan
5767	1	im not against people practicing yoga but it has largely been divorced from its hindu roots in the us which is sort of by definition cultural appropriation the problem isnt that people are doing yoga it is that more than half of the people who go to yoga studios cant identify whether it is of a buddhist hindu etc origin and yes i know yoga exists in buddhism also the even bigger problem is the fact that many yoga studios are marketed towards a specific socioeconomic class of people mainly middle and upper class white women and effectively rules out participation by minority or hindus due to location pricing culture etc im not saying this should inherently be fixed free market and all that but just pointing out the projection of the issue the even bigger problem is that there are many yogis out there who have tried to adapt yoga to align with christian beliefs and the bible which is justinexplicable anytime anyone tries to defend something in the name of hinduism it is automatically labeled as fundamentalist which is not true again the issue isnt that people are practicing yoga in fact it is actually a good thing for people to share and exchange cultural and religious practices the  issue is rather the deliberate and systemic attempts to strip it of its origin and try to adopt it as part of one is own culture
5768	1	how
5769	1	id argue that has more to do with the demographics of desis brought into the us by us immigration laws than with the pros of capitalism

5773	1	what you are referring is not unique to h1b though even citizens and others have a choice of employment stability or higher wages  you get higher wage if you change companies or stay at your wage if you want employment stability and if you could humor me on these talking points about the h1b visa again one of the most highly compensating professional class in the us gtthe bigger issue is that you cannot start your own company cannot start your own business h1b visa is a temporary work visa though there is a business visa and actually a green card which allows your open a business and unlike employment based visas there is not wait time for business visa and there were articles about several indians using that to get their green cards whether pooling resources to invest in motels subways or other business  gtyou can never be unemployed so you cannot take risky jobs even though they offer better paycareer advancement opportunitiesmany of the desis in the silicon valley jump jobs quite often it is the tech culture in the us look up linkedin profiles of desis on h1bs so this idea that people dont change jobs seems weird gtif you dont know already netflix is famous for firing people ruthlesslyalso one of the highest compensation in the valley high risk high rewards gt and worst of all your wife cannot work and has to sit at home if she cannot get a h1b herself this is not anything new though the wives are aware of this restriction before getting married and there are innovative ways to get around this restriction as done by many wives of the tech professionals it is america there are ways around if you have the will to do it gtshe cannot even volunteer for any position if that position is otherwise a paid onethe definition of a volunteer position is unpaid labor and there are several organizations where the wives of indian tech workers volunteer their time for no money i have seen this in san joseseattleaustin areas so how again are these highly paid professionals having a tough time in the us there is space for empathy and there is a lot to go around especially within the desi community who are aware of the challenges of immigration in the united states but maybe the exaggerations with things like using the phrase indentured servitude needs to be toned down if the issues is to be addressed

5794	1	i disagree first of all i think merit based immigration system would be more fair but that is a long shot given how anything related immigration works in usif two people from country a and b have similar education and have similar jobs i disagree that their country of birth should play any role in deciding when they get pr it should neither benefit them nor work against them it doesnt matter what they did before they decided to apply for employment based pr in employment based category the only thing that should matter is their employment diversity visa can have it is own conditionsi do agree somewhat agree about people knowing what they signed up for but even that involves some complications when people came to us in 2000s they saw the wait was 23 years in late 2000s it became 45 years now it could be anywhere between 2050 years you cant tell that to someone who came here after finishing their high school or undergrad that they should have evaluated their options and predicted that the wait is going to explode you need to be in their shoes to understand what all went through their mind before making this decision its very easy to say oh they should know this as a us citizendisc i am one of those in the queue for 2050 years so i have my own biases

5796	1	i wont argue that it is a good thing that our parents dont kick us out  i love that our parents go above and beyond for us when it comes to education and making sure we have a life the issue is when they obviously not all parents go above and beyond only for the things they deem acceptable all the times they did something for youwell it is fodder for emotional blackmail later if you walk off the path that youre supposed to be onget ready for textsrantingsfights and fightsfinancial blackmailthreats to disown all the things they doit comes with the expectation that you do what they say it is fantastic when your values and ideals align when youre like some of us and they dont it is hell on earth im not seen as an independent being i am seen as an extension of them at the age of 30 im seen as a dumb child who is whitewashed and dares to think that i can follow happiness every time i stand up for myself it is emotional turmoil between being a good daughter and following what i know to be true and good for me that nice car and house is absolutely nothing to me to be seen as an individual would mean everything i dont need a car or house to be happy i try to speak to my parents and im screamed at but i try again because i value that relationship your point about a healthy and loving environment is the most debatable youre right about some white people having that shitty experience but they have healthy family units as well the brown family you described is not mine my parents are miserable together and my brother and i suffer for it  they should have divorced i just need my parents to love me encourage me and maybe just support and accept me that is literally priceless this is just my experience
5797	1	what do you mean by access to external affairs ministry giving a visa to someone to enter your country is not even remotely the same as inviting him to your pms party there are no games here india isnt angry at canada for giving a visa to atwal it is angry that he was invited to your pms party and disappointed that your vetting is shitty enough to miss that fat lot of good being in five eyes did to canada

5813	1	ive notice muslims practice religion with more rigor than believers in other religions practice their religion one of the most talked about thing that comes up while growing up muslim is whether a practice is in line with islamic principles islam claims to have come as a reformist religion because pre islamic faiths didnt protect their divinely ordained religion from man made practices so most muslims are careful with celebrating holidays from other religions especially if the specifics of the celebration go against islamic principles that being said i do know a few cultural muslims who celebrate holidays from other religions

5832	1	i think around 6070 of hindus eat meat  meat eating including beef was practiced long before islam islam started around 600ad vedas which were authored around 1500bc already included references to meat consumption including horses venison cowbuffalo i think pork was probably a lot less established in india because it was so easy to grow other forms of meat pork was probably a lot more popular in europe due to the weather pigs can thrive even in cold weather as long as they have dry places to sleep in  say barns but cows and buffalos need warmer weather to thrive ampx200b

5863	1	first focus on your grades your social life means nothing if you fail out of school your future is more important second studying is not about motivation it is about self discipline you have to force yourself to sit down and do it there is no other way self discipline takes practice and commitment it will not happen overnight if your depression is interfering significantly go see your school is counselors most colleges will allow 110 free visits take care of your mental health by actively working to improve it it is not easy but you have to put in work to make things betteronto your social life 21 yo virgin is not old there are plenty of men and women older than you who are completely normal and well adjusted and also virgins this is a lot more common than you think so try to reframe your thinking from this is the worst thing ever im so behind everyone to this is more common than i think and i will work on changing it it might take some time but it will happenthere is no magic way to ask girls out faster you just have to do it the worst that can happen is they decline fear of rejection is normal but if you let it rule your life youll be miserable and regret the chances you missed there are different ways to approach things and you have to pick what feels best for you a basic thing is compliment  do you want to grab coffee sometimedo you want to study together sometime in my personal opinion one thing that might help you is to first focus on making friends then try to start asking girls out this will give you more experience with social interactions and will expose you to more people and hopefully at least add one positive aspect having friends to your life ask people in your class male and female to study with you join organizations other than frats especially something that interests you so you can find likeminded people actively try to engage in conversation even if you find small talk boring making friends can be hard work there is no doubt about that but you have to start taking small steps and putting in effort for it to pay off

5888	1	that is because desi families are expected to be closer based on cultural norms and familiarity can definitely breed contempt it is easy to appear functional when the expectation is to only occasionally interact with one anotheri know a white nurse that absolutely resented her daughter for going to undergrad close to home and visiting home every weekend her and her husband were excited to have their youngest child turn 18 and to finally have peace quiet and time for themselves this is by no means the norm but just an anecdote to exemplify that the grass always appears greener on the other side

5890	1	i appreciate you explaining where this kind of internalized bias may come from and it may as well be true for a lot of people the woman is question is hindu and has been married to an indian man for a long time she has also lived in india for long stretches of time there are a lot of fijian indian people where i live and i am friends with and work with several i have never heard any other people of fijian descent be hostile towards indians in the same way as this lady other fijian indians ive met identify with and deeply care for their indian roots the hindus go to religious pilgrimages to temples in india often and know which region in india their ancestors come from and try to find out more about their heritage their hindi dialect is very different than the hindi north indians speak but the lady i was talking about talks in the north indian dialect and not the fijian one perhaps this is due to living with an indian in india it may give some context that she comes from a wealthy family in fiji and i have heard her talk in a derogatory way towards other fijians who are not so wealthy i was talking about only this one woman who has no reservations about voicing her negative opinions about various different topics about indians to their faces people are allowed to feel a certain way about the world but it is not polite to voice said opinions  and blatantly insult the people in your company every time
5891	1	i tried to post an article and it wouldnt let me im not sure if ive just been blocked i wouldnt even mind necessarily if this sub banned the discussion of sikh issues except theyre perfectly happy to rail against jagmeet singh and post a bunch of pro india smears against himzero consistency very clear bias
5892	1	hacked version
5893	1	well i agree with what you are saying and since op told us to read her post history about this situation i went ahead and did and seems to be she is not practicing islamic religion anymore so therefore even if they do happen to get married the religion wont be an issue unless they both decides to go over to her parents house i doubt she want to live with them forever but all i am saying she has to make the decision what she wants to do with her life  and if her parents no way accepting of her current bf maybe they might accept him if he decides to convert or just fully move on with her life without her parents being involved

5922	1	she writes like shes in middle school its why its so easy to spot her writing it just a jumble of stream of consciousness often switching to topics without finishing the previous one and filled with excessive punctuation questions and exclamationsshe writes like shes talking to herself rather than an audience
5923	1	i have she was the best girl ive ever dated beautiful probably too beautiful ahahaha really cool and smart we dated for a bit and did lots of things together but they just kinda fizzled out when i had to go back to university because she was 25

5933	1	i think its slowly changing theres a ton more positive desi perspectives in hollywood now and the fb creepy messages are also going away at least ive been getting less of them as those countries modernize and people get used to using the internet maybe those weird looks are looks of interest i know i make a weird face when im debating the best way to approach a guy it does send a message but i think it really depends on how the person affected responds to it i grew up predominantly  in the south where every race was crucified by memes people made slavery white trash mexican memes etc and just about all of the people of those races laughed it off as a joke they understood that it was a meme but they also let us know that not everyone is like that and we cant generalize them to an entire race imo people are always gonna make racial memesjokes but i think theres a way for members of a race to influence that message while also seeing it as a joke
5934	1	i dont know if all that stuff is right or believable but i do believe this is a fake relationship they have no chemistry in their romantic videos together theyre like two people whove never met and both are bad actors it screams fake everything  literally everything  in their wedding being brandedacting as an advertisement too is so weird again dont know about all that stuff but i think this is def a pr publicity marriage to increase her american profile and introduce him to a whole new fanbase note that their sangeet featured all his new songs

5953	1	isnt pakistan the least developed major south asian nation i mean when you look at measures like literacy and hdi that certainly seems to be the case add on top of that the terrible economic situation and it is unlikely to catch up to india sri lanka or bangladesh the gap will widen in all likelihood i wouldnt expect the pakistani economy to improve much either simply because it is so dependent on china and china doesnt want improvement because that would mean less dependence on china debt trap is a bitch

5965	1	gthowever if certain dharmic traditions want to go back to the more flexible varna amp jati system within their communityi mean why would anyone who is in the lower rungs of the ladder ever seek out a system like thisthis is by no means a hindu problem we have the same issues in the muslim and christian communities where there is a lot of talk about women voluntarily seeking out a subordinate role it may be voluntary in the sense that there is no physical coercion but involuntary in that it involves losing all connections including connections that allow you to financially survive to family and community if you run afoul of the rules
5966	1	in my generation z black dudes rule pop culture my roommate who is black could get laid anytime he wanted to i think it is just people who have gotten used to the modern dating culture who have an easier time going out another close friend of mine in my dorm who is an fob like me was pretty much the most sexually active dude i knew he came from an upper class family from calcutta and was he was quite desensitizednaturalized like american youngsters to the modern datingpartying scene im come from ranchibasically bihari from a very sheltered background and i didnt really get how this dating stuff worked cause i was never really exposed to it but i never thought that i was rejected because i was brown the main reason was cause i was an overweight dude playing videogames all the time being brown may have amplified that but it wasnt the core issue my point is anyone can be successful at dating shit you just gotta put in the work and even if you do face racism hey it is getting better for the newer generation people  thanks to your hard work
5967	1	gt i would let the girl decide and the child decide on what religion he wants to follow it is not so simple issues can arise if one parent actively encourages and indoctrinates the child to their religion the child will naturally follow that religion and this can cause the other parent to become resentful these are things to discuss and think about a head of time rather than ignoreampx200b
5968	1	dont worrythat wont work out in the long run for ibm you just have to focus on companies that pay for quality for every ibm there are tons of good employers that are willing to pay for good talent at least the immigrants are equal to citizens when they do come in rather than the indentured servitude that takes place in the usa with the whole green card backlog situation

5974	1	saying the wall is a waste of money is a valid argument saying that it is a symbol of hate and racism is not the people who were outraged at the child separations should instead be outraged at the parents who decided to have kids in a 3rd world country and then feel entitled to illegally come to the us

5998	1	hindu nationalists objected to the aryan invasion theory iat that held that the aryans came and wiped out the indus valley civilization the implication was violent bloody invasions were ok since that had been the modus operandi foreverthat racist garbage was debunked by at least the 1920s but the iat what was taught to us in high school as late as the early 90sas for the assertions of the articles author about what hindu nationalists think you can read what they really think for yourself httpswisdaumwordpresscomaryaninvasiontheoryan excerptgt arya is a sanskrit word which basically means a good wise kind honest honorable person arya is an esteem that one earns abiding by such virtues person without these qualities will be considered anarya it is not limited to any particular culture or region to illustrate the typical usage of the wordgt in the rig veda the oldest veda krrinvanto vishvam aryam  which calls upon the arya to make the whole world aryagt also when the historical buddha siddhartha gautama called his four noble truths as catvari arya satyanigt obviously the authors were not limiting arya to any race region religion or ethnicityessentially the bbc articles author was projecting his perceptions of nazi ideology on hindu nationalists irrespective of what they actually thought

6004	1	if you are talking about hindus they love sikhs hindus and sikhs intermarry all the time i am a product of that if you want to talk about the injustice done to sikhs go ahead most hinduatva followers will also say it was extremely wrong of the government but you definitely are confused if you think right wing people are the ones that commited this in fact it was the left wing party which is the congress which did that in fact ram jethmalani who is a bjp leader on the night of the assassination of indra gandhi went to the home minister to urge them to protect sikhs  httpsenwikipediaorgwiki1984_antisikh_riotsthey also recently convicted people which sucks it took this long is at least something now if you support the khalistani cause i think you do support terrorism they terrorized and killed innocent people long before the siege of the golden temple it is not unclear that a huge portion of canadian punjabi diaspora support the khalistani cause which is a bad memory for a lot of punjabi hindusthe reason the riots is not called genocide is because it would be disrespectful to communities that have expereince genocide the 2 most accurate versions of genocide are the jews in ww2 and the armenian genocide both accounts taken into consideration millions of people the sikh riots had its highest estimates account for 17000 people if we call every mass killing a genocide the meaning of the word is gone as it is used for the most heinous of crimes that is why the correct term people use is pogroms

6011	1	the embarrasment though is partly because western media has for a very long time now been far more racist towards india and its people compared to japan or korea so indians abroad get conditioned into thinking most westerners only have negative image of india and thus are not interested of course this is true in alot of cases so i understand why we often dont want to talk about our culture with foreigners since they often have an inaccurate and negative view about us
6012	1	have fun let me know how it turns out
6013	1	the govt which harmed sikhs in 1984 are not present but many sikhs still honor khalistani terrorists who killed civilians even today dont expect the indian govt to stay silent if some khalistanis are planning attacks on indian soil nobody has problem with ordinary sikhs just the extremists
6014	1	gt  i dont know what pandit genocide youre talking about theyve always made 5 of the population and that hasnt changed according to recent censusesyou are literally denying the ethnic cleansing of hindus from the valley kashmiri hindus were majority a century ago the fact that they have become minorities shows the extent of extremism

6024	1	hi laiba
6025	1	nope im not whining im pointing out the double standard here anonymously since there is almost never a place to talk about this in real life indian men including me whine the least of all groups because we are mentally stronger and more stoic many of the things women and blacks whine about we would never even consider bringing up for discussion if indians for example wanted affirmative action in sports because our culture doesnt value sports as much then you would have a point

6030	1	just because you or the reddit circle or the incel circle hasnt heard of it doesnt mean no one has heard about it ive already given you the numbers which prove that firstmet has a large enough userbase but the userbase is irrelevant when their survey sample itself is as large as 18 million people out of uk is 66 million people this is the largest sample among all such surveys there is a reason why hrithik roshan and shahid kapoor are even more desired than zayn malik in the uk who himself is among the top 10 most desired men in the uk despite bollywood being not as popular there indians have stayed long enough in the uk to influence their culture and they even have an indian dish as one of their national dishes i think the same thing is possible even in the usgtindians are grouped together with asians because they are asians and have most of the same stereotypes and issues anywaystereotypes are not the only factor in determining racial preference in dating so you admit that you have no sources then please try to work hard and improve yourself instead of blaming your race though i wouldnt recommend dating unless you have an established career foreignborn indians are among the most privileged groups in the west as well as in other developed eastern countries like singapore and hong kong in almost all parameters and propaganda or selfhate doesnt change facts
6031	1	yeah youre just coping hard dude lol

6054	1	gtas ive repeatedly stated the law of the land anyone who breaks the law is subject to be punished if people choose to ignore the law and they get caught they can be punished lolyou just justified putting the uighurs in genocidal camps congrats gtnot to mention youre ignorant of how or why individualism or communalism racistsi dont even understand what this sentence is supposed to mean or convey gtshort answer in societies where economic oppertunties are a plenty law and order exists state protects the safety of citizens there is no longer a need for communal living otherwise communal living are essential for having access to resources some form of justice and survival of individualsthat doesnt really affect anything societies that favor individual rights or communal rights still can have law and order logical error number 1 gttheres a reason communal living has always been the preferred method of living for societies bar the last 100120 years where humanity has made great strides especially post wwii when us greately increases production and went on to popularize consumerismindividual human rights have their basis in the enlightenment philosophy you know the stuff that enabled the world to transcend superstition and gave you modern science so a bit older than that seems like you actually may not progressed past anthropology 101 gtnot at all im speaking about integration which can and does often leave to assimilationit is obvious at this point you have no clue what you are talking about gtimplying that i support your argument for integrationyou actually said that for pakistan just a post ago gtimplying us isnt a secular nation maybe dont spend time on altright forums that might helpthe us isnt a christian republic not like the islamic republic of pakistan nice try though gtto you maybe but not to nations like pakistan hey your argument was that of integration not mine i simply told you that you cant complain about treatment of minorities in pakistan or even india if you favor forced education for the purposes of integrationactually i can you see if migrants such as say yourself support barbaric ideas like say honor killings beating their women or preventing their members from exercising basic human rights then they should be educated shoving islam down their throats ala pakistan isnt exactly respecting their basic human rights gtdo you think my personal protections in the us are somehow an objective bases of an argument lolgtobjective as in not being an ideologue and understanding the reasons for why communal living exists and is required vs when communalism diminishes and allows room for individualism to take hold and growthat doesnt really matter though you can can your faux intellectualism what you are doing is implying communalism is better than individualism despite enjoying all the rights that an individualist society provides for one thing that is pure hypocrisy maybe keep praying towards a cube that will teach you more about anthropology

6067	1	this is a lie lol gun violence is generally only a problem with gangs  yeah obviously shootings happen but a big part of staying safe here is just not being stupid ie paying attention to your surroundings not keeping headphones in at night etc its not provincial in the slightest  people move here all the time it has a huge yuppie population and a huge indian population granted im biased and ive grown up in the suburbs and spent the last seven years here but chicago is home and its wonderfully accepting

6076	1	it really depends on area ive seen plenty of subcontinental men do extremely well in the uk and canada perhaps your perspective on this subject may be due to insufficient social experience or lack of exposure to other parts of the occident which is not a monolithic cultural sphere with uniform aesthetic mores the few instances i have seen of subcontinental men denigrating their own ethnicity seems to be predicated on selfhatred and blaming their ethnicity for their own failures when that could be attributed to other deficiencies in personality and physicalityi respect your right to have negative feelings about any uncomfortable dynamics in your own parents relationships but advise against projecting this viewpoint onto every other eurodescendanteuropean man x subcontinental woman pairing the preponderance of subcontinental women with white men compared to those with black men could mostly be attributed to demographic constitution and cultural compatibility more than anything there arent so many subcontinental individuals in china or the drc as there are in some whitemajority areas and this tends to affect how common certain pairings are furthermore if were going to discuss ethnic prejudice there have been instances of east eurasian and subsaharan antipathy towards subcontinental individuals this might impact how common it is for subcontinental women to date chinese men as well as men of other ethnic backgrounds

6083	1	you guys can say hasthinapuram and pataliputra right why is thiruvananthapuram difficult would reading it in devanagariतरवनतपरम make it easier

6109	1	no one is denying that caste system exists as a social evil but that isnt the same thing as a systemic state sponsored legal oppression article 15 of the constition banned it in 1950 pretty much right after india gained independece in comparison segregation in us was legal at state level until the civil rights act of 1964 centuries after us gained independence
