9	1	gtlooking at me especially in comparison to my grandmother and my greatgrandfather you would have no idea that i am related to them i had a long speech prepared about identity and ethnicity and all that jazz and then it got erased as i posted it and then i thought long and hard about what i really want to tell you you should talk to your mom about your family and your history and your heritage when youre proud of her it adds to being proud of yourself yeah im hawaiian but i can recite specifically how and where and when and even why im a certain hawaiian and that is part of my identity a lot of people cant when people look for identity they usually look for purpose to go with it so ask your mom youre old enough to handle the good the bad and everything about it you can do things to make yourself look more native get tanned over the summer grow your hair long or short wear certain necklaces or clothes etc but if you want to be more native you can research your family you can go to your reservationand it is your reservationand make friends get to know everyone that is really how it starts dude
10	1	everyone grew chenopodium even on the northern plains i bought the book you recommendedso will try it out next fall i think part of the draw is that while maize came from mesoamerica or western mexico as some theorize goosefoot marsh elder sunflowers and squash were independently domesticated in the eastern woodlands

15	1	there is always a chance the courts can decide that such a contract is illegal there are some rights you cant sign away
16	1	i really wish i had more for you in the outset as i mostly studied eastern petitions with a few in the midwestgt why would the feds drag their feet in rerecognizing the chinook tribe teeny tribes in california get recognized on an annual basisand it must be an epic struggle for them how are they able to succeed while the chinook cantgreat questions offhand i would say the mission system probably created a sufficient document record that continued through the successor churches and congregant communities that whittled down into the tiny ones that get recognized todayim not implying it was a cushy system whereas in my circles at least some other natives familiar with that story have had loaded things to say about those mission indians and their slave masters gt in 2002 when thentribal chairman gary johnson  tony johnsons father  was in washington dc for the lewis and clark bicentennial he received a call on his cellphone under george w bushs administration their recognition had been revokedthis is the most substantive part of the article aside from the federal register notice linkhttpswwwfederalregistergovarticles2001010901609finaldeterminationtoacknowledgethechinookindiantribechinooknationformerlychinookindian al jazeera really skimps on the story by not providing the updates everywhere ofa page with pretty much all of the official goodshttpwwwbiagovwhoweareasiaofadecidedcasespetition57indexhtm the ibia decision is keythe objections are fairly standard that the petitioner did not meet its burden but look at bullet points 79 on the november 11 2001 letter secretary is decision gt 7 whether the previous asia improperly accorded the chinook petitioner a presumption of continued existencegt gt 8 whether the previous asia is decision was improperly based on the advice and recommendation of a consultant retained by the asia to provide input outside of the regular departmental decision making processgt gt 9 whether the previous asla is decision reflects bias a personal political agenda calculated to implement a recognition policy at odds with the intent of the existing regulations and is tainted by the appearance of a conflict of interestmore questions than answers youre right this is a fluff piece insofar as it carelessly shrugs its shoulders at the deeper story alluded to in the ibia decision
17	1	i appreciate your efforts to show an interest in our cultures and attempts to make your work as legitimate as possible however there are a few things you might want to be aware oflike uoriginal_greaser_bob mentioned it is a very thin line very thin in fact you might as well pour oil all over the line and make it pitch dark outsideand make the line black in other words the approval of one native guy doesnt mean it has the approval of the community especially with religious ceremoniessome things are public events like powwows while others are way more personal as it seems your teacher made it a point that this ceremony is personal and beautiful however in native culture keeping things private is also valued there is an old saying i recall those that say dont know those that know dont sayi am also not affiliated with any of the tribes that practice peyote but i have a feeling this interpretation of it could be misleading particularly because of the audience it is aimed at i dont want to sit here all day and bash you for your work in general the video work was nice but two points of constructive criticism i would like to mention your title says native american peyote ritual this gives the impression that this is practiced by all natives yet it definitely does not apply to all tribes in the future i would suggest making the titles of these kinds of videos a bit more specific since it is probably not going to be a native audience watching this and we dont want to perpetuate any stereotypes among the nonnatives if you insist on continuing with this video stress that these events are not to be treated as flippant tourist attractions many native people do not approve of sharing these kinds of things there is a reason you have to be affiliated with a native community to even be an observer
18	1	gt third way is how you look and frankly in society today how we look counts for a lot do you think being predominately european looking would be an issue then i look the whitest out of all my siblings looking at me especially in comparison to my grandmother and my greatgrandfather you would have no idea that i am related to them
19	1	lol yeah definitely wed be better off ideally if the bia never even existed before the bia provided services for us they coordinated the take over of indian lands indian agents and explorers the massacres of indian people the theft of native children and the creation of indian bording schools
20	1	while there are structural pressures for us to adopt colonialist attitudes toward our environment and other ethnicities western culture is not so monolithic that there are not multiple and complex forms of resistance if it were otherwise then such things as theories of social constructivism wouldnt existsocial activism environmental activism educational reform postcolonial theory  these are all part of western culture too im a believer in the enlightenment ideal of education being necessary for freedom such as the literacy projects in revolutionary cuba the problem is much of our primary education does not teach us the truth but attempts to make us complicit with the status quo this is why secondary education at its best has to decolonize students thought a perfect decolonized english whatever that may look like is not the solution more critical thought more honest education and more political engagement are real tangible solutionsps much of the movement for a pure english is also tied into anglosaxon white nationalism which is another reason im skeptical of calls to improve the language by bringing it back to some utopian past
21	1	how are we not predisposed having normality forced on us by prior colonialism
22	1	i noticed that too pretty messed up
23	1	yeah the text of the articles is identical but the two headlines set you up to believe something very different

27	1	if im not wrong my understanding is they were confederated as i am fairly ignorant about those other tribes do you have recommendations on where i should go about learning their real stories amp legend
28	1	oh when they cry after singing to their comanche chipmunk friend that passed on so sad
29	1	wow pretty cool thank a lot it is much appreciated

38	1	im honestly not all that sure  i know she is not a status indian but i know lots of natives who live in kahnawake who arent status indians  the mck mohawk council of kahnawake requires 50 blood quantum for tribal enrollment  this is super controversial because it is allowing the canadian government to decide who is native and who is not rather than leaving it to aboriginal communities  basically the government is still finding ways to undermine and define our identity  the only thing i can think of it that she wants to live on the reserve with a nonnative partner which in kahnawake is not allowed unless the couple was together prior to 1980here is a short article about ithttpthelinknewspapercaarticleaddressingtheidentitycrisis

40	1	ahh ok my bad dude p naw man not him at all navajo thats awesome dude  im trying to get more involved in indian stuff since in pr nobody really cares
41	1	i legitimately tried to make sense of the previous post but failed a lot of fantasies have sprouted up about aztlan but the map pretty much shows mexican holdings lost to the us in the treaty of hidalgo that has nothing to do the triple alliance empire or the origin of the nahua people which realistically was probably in northwestern mexico ive had many members of the chicano movement try to convince me that the aztec empire controlled all of what is now the southwestern us which is simply untrue was there long distance trade sure but that is not political or cultural control
42	1	no no she was monacan and she married a boricua dude i was hoping you werent him because yikes that is a whole lot of stuff to deal with  pmy wife is dinenavajo
43	1	im assuming youre the author of the article that was posted which is why im focusing on your treatment of language philosophyactivists arent in the business of forcing their ideas on others rather of arguing for their own ideas and coordinating community response in support of those ideas it is not clear why you dismiss political activism except that you think it is unproductive which i again disagree with it also isnt clear how you propose that we as english speakers decolonize our language without political activismyour description of ideology seems to imply that you are somehow outside of ideology which is tantamount to saying that you have no particular worldvision or political perspective a statement denied by your stance against colonialism the people i brought up are hegel german philosopher who used the dialectic as an analytical tool fanon a caribbean philosopher who discussed the psychology of colonialism and sartre a french philosopher who argued for radical freedom as the source for political action these thinkers are well within the tradition of western philosophy despite forming their thought through colonial languages and all of them are used in anticolonial discourseas for white people not understanding resistance you are again well off the mark for one example the white irish were colonized by the english for over six hundred years classstruggle is likewise a form of resistance though i note that certain groups prefer to ignore marxism in favor of racial and gender politics im not setting up whites as gatekeepers any real political economic ideological change will need to come from coordination between all oppressed communities and not as you hope through each person learning on their own a purer form of englishyou claim that peoplerefuse to talk about colonialism when major fields of research are based on the description of and resistance to colonialism this as well as your unfamiliarity with philosophers whose discourse you deploy makes me think that you just havent met the right people universities are vilified on tv for being politically correct specifically because certain departments english philosophy gender studies native american studies history political science african american studies the humanities generally are critical of the status quo despite their commitment to decolonization however ive never heard any serious discussion of purifying the english language in order to change our socioeconomic structurethe article whether intentionally or not argues for a return to a purer roots form of english which is suggested at the head by quoting orwell as much as i like orwell and think he has useful recommendations for authors the idea that we should cleanse english of latinate influence is similar to throwing the baby out with the bathwater yes english has two broad registers one spoken deriving from the germanic origins and the other written from the latinate getting rid of one register will not eliminate colonialism any more than calling oil black tar will get rid of a petroleum based economyfrom my perspective the only way you can reclaim your heritage is through a community effort at learning and using that tradition there are despite your perspective many many linguists anthropologists community activists traditionalists elders etc who are all attempting to reanimate native american traditions that were suppressed by missionaries government agents soldiers and the like there is room enough in the english language for native american words and concepts if you desire to decolonize thought through language then i believe that native american philosophies religions and traditions offer the best source for linguistic resistance by adding to the english language not subtracting
44	1	the spirit animal part of the project represents such a depth of ignorance on every level  your reply was amazing
45	1	that is real interesting and thank you for showing me that  that is real cool  i wish we were able to go that far with our taino is but the culture was wiped out real fast are you located in va i been meaning to go to a pow wow in there but i always miss them

48	1	i wonder how ole sam bucketmouth and steve stops on tim are doing
49	1	i am from the united states that is typically the way people here refer to indigenous peoples i think in canada the most common way of reference is first peoples or first nation
50	1	hello uhesutu hope youre having a good daygtnot all indigenous nations of the americans identify with being red people and red skins and that is perfectly fine there is nothing wrong with themyou are correct some nations do not identify with being red and that is finegthowever the attacks upon redness by ictmn and indiancountry and lastrealindians and many other socalled indigenous media are acts of deep seated hatred and prejudice against fundamental aspects of identity that many of us holdhowever this part is not correct at least regarding us here at rindiancountry we try to be balanced in our approach to the content that is hosted on this subreddit regarding native issues that means that we are not about to turn into the native version of nazi is and start fear mongering and inciting hatred toward other races to the point where we are witchhunting but we are not going to excuse the actions of those who are either partially or fully responsible for cruel acts committed against us that being said we want to apply this principle to every topic even the more trivial or anecdotal thingsmuch like how there are many native nations in the americas there are many individuals from various tribes that visit this sub because of that there is a large vareity of opinions your opinion is just as welcome here as any other provided those opinions follow the pretty neutral guidelines in fact we want voices like yours we want all these voices because they help to create a better community and help others to see opposing sides personally i do not support the use of native mascots and i believe it would be for the better if some of the names did change however i view this issue as less of a priority than others when it comes to being red i share your sentiments i am a red man as well i use the color red as an identifier and i do not find the word racist in of itself depending on contextwe do not support malicious and careless attacks against people or our culture because someone expresses a dissenting opinion does not mean it is an attack people are free to post why they do or do not support the use of such terms we would appreciate it if you would stop making accusations against the sub again you are welcome here but we ask that you follow the guidelineshttpswwwredditcomrindiancountrywikirules which outline how respect is a big part of our culture thanksand as a ps  unless someone makes a comment or selfpost rindiancountry has not officially made any attacks against the use of the term red or redskins this sub mainly links to other sites that make those statements much like the rnativeamerican subreddit if you are going to judge us then you will have to judge them as well hypocrisy is not very becoming
51	1	i should add this is a true story by my native american studies teacher who is a native american man and has his phd he assisted directed eith all the dialog and has been to over 20 rituals himself those are also real na artifacts in the video this is also for a video contest in my town where we have to make a religiously diverse story and i thought this won would get me first place although it would be great if i showed them all this work i put in to organize this and the judges rush me to kick me in the balls so now that you know all of this is the line still thin and how can i make it more respective to the culture for ex film the preparation more or less dialog etc
52	1	luckily no montana is pretty decent i guess
53	1	ill go check it out now thanks so much
54	1	it seems like california is very openminded about the connections between indigenous peoples south and north of the border probably because of the strong chicanola raza movement and the large presence of mexican and central american indigenous groups in california there are 35000 maya people in the bay area alone you can hear mayan languages spoken in many of their businesses
55	1	it looks like the bia was just mad at the people who made the previous decision thanks for the links i downloaded the final determinationhttpwwwbiagovcsgroupsxofadocumentstextidc001483pdf the quinault nation did indeed have their comments included didnt realize 5 of the chinook are enrolled with the quinault i gotta admit this turns to garbledy gook pretty quickly too bad i would love to see the chinook regain their federal recognition
56	1	you can tell me about those too  ours in puerto rico had something similar i believe the taino petroglyph
57	1	doesnt the superimposition of colonial relations by european powers not also exclude what is presented as what is today the very real unreality  but those then not yet unreal material conditions  the material conditions that prior to modern colonialism there were preexisting disputes between rival agendas between variously opposed tribal formations for example diversity of gender amp race amp etc as well as the various expressions of methods of governance though out of my ignorance as a blatant selfhating settlercolonialist as opposed to a settlercolonialist who supports settler colonialism i cant detail historical reality in relation to certain tribal dynamics i cant accurately understand this 500 year fight to protect amp reclaim turtle island  i cant understand this history to undo  without unlearning the colonial public relations industry amp being worthy of knowing a specific history of sovereign traditional cultures that have survived a specific history that a settlercolonialist like me never deserves to ever know without official recognition by the localized tribal authority amp i consider it a violation of the sacred sovereignty to have learned what i do know about tribal history from others assimilated into the predominant thought formations by civilization is alliance against sovereign culture is it ever presented as unreasonable that the settler colonialist school machine has became hyperfocused on those examples of aztlan amp so forth because they outshadow the obvious preexistence of noncivilizational tribal formationsthis seems to me to be a clear silencing of the ongoing industrial genocide of the unassimilateables who may have no relation to the superimposition of a global field of capitalism despite their blood being actually mixed with the land by their way of life amp undeniable genetic lineage however obscure as if your power gives you the right to prospect the biology others landbases and captivate them as united in separation amp almost permanently isolated by almost all expressions of capitalism if capitalism then read settler colonialism at the end of the day what does it matter what does decolonizing my mind amp heart matter when i am still bound by material conditions which prevent me from contributing to decolonizing turtle island you know the white man came to this country with the bullet amp the bible if he doesnt humble you with the bible then he crumbles you with the bullet amp he is still praising the lord amp passing ammunition all over the world since weve spokesilence is a violent invisibilizing which erroneously dismisses real oppression as choosing victimization
58	1	he shared some of his poetry and conducted a meet and greet thereafterit was a surprisingly intimate event and the access that people can get in the dc area floors me sometimes his participation at that venue was charitable
59	1	aha thank you can you explain the skawennati situation i heard she is not allowed to live on the reserve

61	1	thank you for your response it really helped a lot just from the natives ive spoken to they dont seem to appreciate random people coming and potentially appropriating their culture so i just want to avoid that but i will definitely keep learning the language and try to get more involved with things in my local area
62	1	what bothers me about these articles is theyre platforms for stand up shilling and attacksseldom do the articles pointout their funding their singlemember status and their role as a proxy for big casino interests the basis for their claim at ibia was paid for in partnership with mgm international who didnt want to further sully their image by continued association with this greedinspired action but appropriately armed stand up to do the dirty work
63	1	thank you very much kool  i appreciate your generous gift of time and attention  id like to ask you for just a little more who are the various tribes of the warm springs reservationwould you know some any or many of the early tribes that did not survive eg the calapooiado you think there is a single wellauthenticated resource that i might find that describes the history and lives of these early peoplebtw a search revealed nothing regarding the calapooia im a writer and i want to try to enter their names into my work thank you again for your efforts in any reply you might make  this is not a commercial project for me  some names just need to be at least remembered right
64	1	when colonialist norms fail there is still force why do you think native resistance has yet to abolish the ongoing genocide im not interested in activism which is merely a role like a cop a priest a lawyer a school teacher an activist etc who commits to an ideology so they can push ideas on other people who have already been exposed to a range of western propaganda techniques from birth the logical error of fallacy permeates the rhetoric of advertising politics and religion and as such the prior formation of ideas prior to colonialism repression of the psyche and social exploitation etc consists of people only finding reasons to go on believing as they already do all that fosters inertia is automatically pro status quo how do you really expect those notions of enlightenment formed by classical liberalism to bring about some rapid mythical paradigm shift towards decolonization when most settlers dont even consider ideas from other settlers decolonizing language means decolonizing a system of thought as the way you talk is the way you think a refusal or inability to understand let alone acknowledge dialectic engagement is the failure to start or continue evolutionary thought formation amp development from where our ancestors left off and is considered a major concern to effective resistance youre the only one talking about utopia here and im not here to anchor my soul in halfhearted attempts at liberating us from the structures of colonialism the assimilation into colonial language and power dynamics the prevailing silence over the real struggle amp lack of basic support and the ideological isolation and alienation from the cultural front colonialism now is not an invasion but a structure disregarding attempts to decolonize language as perfectionist and utopian trivialize the real longterm impact of language on thought formation as if to fain ignorance of the public relations propaganda industry and to hinder the treating of its impact on the mind body and spiriti am not here to take away from real struggles so that nobody can resist our alienation from nature
65	1	gt are you still claiming to be indian i do not contest whatsoever you have distant ancestry how much pamunkey do you speak do you talk to your ancestors accept their perspective or something elsegt so sorry the casino maneuver did not work out that must suck no doubt you guys will eventually prevail in these legal actionsfirst you talk about people here being colonized then you come out with this hypocritefuck your posturing that is the most colonized bullshit ive heard from youand im not going to tolerate it here last warning
66	1	thank you
67	1	could you specify what the new age thing is i definitely dont want to disrespect the culture so knowing what not to do would be helpful in regards to approaching my elders is that still possible if my family does not have tribal status we also live on the opposite side of the country now away from where my greatgrandfather came from is it more so approaching the elders in my local community and getting involved here im sorry i really dont know very much but i thank you for your response because every little bit helps
68	1	ty for that just about anything arts clothes stuff that has been knitted like a swag covers etc
69	1	we just dont know enough about the situation from this article the reporters didnt spend much time trying to get the real informationthe northern cheyenne tribal court seems to think the kids were in danger with their father the minnesota court system seemed to think their dad is just fine and grandma kidnapped them i guarantee both courts know a lot more about this case than we do but they came to opposite conclusions lots of child custody cases just make your heart ache for a lot of kids there is no good optioni think the reason we should care about it here is because it is an example of the weird relationship between federal law state law and tribal law most of the time there is a conflict between those three the tribes lose
70	1	where do you think the various understandings of social constructivism come fromif all ideas and language are tainted by colonialism then social constructivism is especially so

78	1	no at all why lol
79	1	cheyenne people have many aspects of bilateral kinship however it is primarily matrilineal as far as band identity is concerned therefore the children belong with their matrilineal side the mother is incapable therefore the responsibility for care goes to the maternal grandparents this is the decision upheld by the courtperhaps you would now like to argue that cheyenne courts are invalid and only white courts run by illegal aliens are valid because that is the argument you will need to present to proceed with your claims

82	1	unfortunately not one based on any evidence or reason just one based on fearmongering
83	1	im not here to force ideas on others which is the primary tactic of the activist milieu i try to provide critical support for mutual self empowerment within the struggle as we learn from one another is situations amp as we harmonize diverse interests among competing agendas for the future society the need for judgment will disappear the difference is that ideology relegates people to roles limited them while denying the significance outside of the classwarfare and struggle for decolonization and for total liberation im unfamiliar with those people you bring up i will not be satisfied so long as whites who provide little to no understanding of resistance present themselves as the gatekeepers for those marginalized by the struggle there should be no gatekeepers for decolonization beyond mutualselfempowerment and i say this in explicit commitment against the settler culture which has bound me against my heritage we cannot be separate from our backgrounds and we are just as much products of society as anybody else beyond the choice to thresh though and explicitly learn from these historical struggles of past and present which very few people dont refuse to talk about let alone attempt decolonization despite all the reasons not to resist jails institutions and deathwho is talking about going back id just rather not impose an abstract culture that has nothing to do with any reality of the localized land onto a people who remain separate from the land as well this separation upholds the very core of colonization it takes generations to repair our relationship with the land and we are directly alienated from nature by these material conditions of separation nobody said revolution is impossible before you brought it up very few people live in harmony with the land and i mean actual material conditions not just a philosophical commitment we are no longer captives of god but metaphysics

87	1	i dont get your description of logical errors but it seems that your argument eats itself are you not an activist or an advocate isnt that just merely a rolefirst i wouldnt be so dismissive of activism especially on this subreddit where such things as the american indian movement should be regarded as an important political movement that drew attention to the effects of colonialism on native americanssecond much of the discourse that youre using derives from a combination of western philosophy and revolutionary politics from figures such as hegel fanon sartre etc isnt your very use of this discourse or language evidence that western thought can evolve and be revolutionized isnt this entire conversation evidence that we are not eternally constrained by spellingthird i agree that the way you talk is the way you think however i dont agree that bringing english back to a state prior to the norman conquest the industrial revolution the enlightenment and especially american contact and colonization is the answer changing the orthography will not revolutionize thought returning to a more germanic form of english will not return us to naturefourth how do you propose to bring about this return to a precolonial english without education what your advocating for is impossible without a massive educational reform nothing short of a revolution but youre putting the cart before the horse by saying that revolution is impossible without first changing the entire language this is what i mean by your argument eating itself

91	1	now we know  yes he is been arrestededit httpwwwgrandforksheraldcomnewscrimeandcourts4176085arrestmadeconnectionvideotapedthreatsdakotaaccesspipeline
92	1	gofundme
93	1	disenrollment rips a tribe apart at the seams it shreds the fabric of a tribe culturally socially politically and legally i do not wish disenrollment upon any tribe
94	1	when i first heard about the december 5 eviction order my eyes bugged out as it brought images of a full guns blazing assault with all that might imply as the news was clarified it seems that the government is actually adopting tightening of the siege tactics in hopes of wearing down the defenders i expect further such moves on their part over the next month and a half until trump is sworn inat in january then it is anyone is guess the man is an unstable megalomaniac but there is no doubt that there are many in the apparatus who can hopefully explain the facts of political life to him
95	1	thank you i hope that we can form a new intergovernmental coalition to help protect against these violations
96	1	2 i do not know enough about the metis of canada to answer this question perhaps you can provide me more context especially as to what is meant by residual trustee class

98	1	all hollywood talk aside i dont care who she or jesse are i place my concern in how she blatantly finds it funny that she knowingly desecrated pohaku sacred if the stones pohaku were not deemed and told to her as being sacred why would she continuously refer to them as such and then further disrespect in clearly stating and laughing about kanaka that professed concern for her actions and the state of the pohaku
99	1	theyre not suspicious of anybody for writing in this sub theyre suspicious of somebody who posted the same information across multiple subs over the span of a short timebig difference
100	1	yes i can understand the point youve highlighted funny in context of rubbing ones ass on mt rushmore and detroying it perhaps that is funny however rubbing ones ass on sacred stones here in hawaii and then laughing about how them falling out of place not funny not fucking funny at all
101	1	hi gabe thanks for this ama first just a technical reddit usage note i notice you have series of short posts done in a twitter like character limited style reddit doesnt have small limits on post size it would probably be better to have full thoughts in one post rather than many separate since the sorting here is based on votes and not time of posting and so the order will get messed up that all said im reposting here your stream about the george case to keep it in order so it is clear what im responding togt thanks for your question the nooksack 306 disenrollmentor purported disenrollment as of this past thanksgiving evehas gotten decent airtime still one issue that begs the overarching question of who belongs is as followsgt nooksack ancestor annie george was born to matsqui george chief of a nooksack village in souther british columbia and marie samiat a woman of his tribe according to canadian oblate records marie died a few days after annie was borngt matsqui remarried to another nooksack woman named madeline jobe who raised annie as her own daughter annie never knew another mother other than madelinegt yet now over a century later my clients opponents claim it was a fraud for the 306 to claim madeline jobe as their ancestor to claim madeline as annie is mother therefore they claim the 306 dont belonggt the arguments about annie is belong by way of madeline and thus my folks belonging highlights a disconnect between traditional indigenous notions of kinship belonging and modern nonindigenous notions of tribal membershipi have read a lot in the news about the nooksack case but it seems most articles leave out a lot my personal perspective is all these descendants are unquestionably american indians and are obviously citizens of this nation and this is really about a political dispute between rival factions in the nation one group which is inappropriately using this nuclear option of disenrollment to advance their own power and silence critics unlike some other cases with disenrollment there is but to explain the details to others it would be helpful to have some confirmed details am i correct to understand that matsqui george was a natural born nooksack citizen as was marie samiat since she was a woman of his tribe and madeline jobe as well this one seems uncontestedis nooksack citizenship traditionally matrilineal patrilineal or otherwiseis adoption a traditionally recognized historical method of being accepted as a citizen of the nation im assuming yes since that is the case for nearly all indigenous nations but i havent seen this addressedthanks for clarifications and good luck with this case i might post some other questions about the whole bia election recognition fiasco going on right now but i wanted to target this question on the traditional nationality issue thanks
102	1	i wholeheartedly agree my initial question to uwintervein was seeking further clarity perhaps they were unaware of the link they provided and it is context benefit of the doubt is always an option imo
103	1	thanks
104	1	ill start flairing them that way if it keeps going
105	1	then were gonna have to do it on the shaft or do you have scales on that already
106	1	dill behave i promise ill try to get you that flair you asked about
107	1	that is some bullshit on the other hand where were they getting 50k that is a lot of money
108	1	hope they come through
109	1	this coming from the porn addict lol
110	1	here is an article with a video for more clarity we beg for your forgiveness veterans join native elders in celebration ceremonyhttpwwwsaloncom20161205webegforyourforgivenessveteransjoinnativeeldersincelebrationceremonyutm_sourcetwitteramputm_mediumsocialflowedit to fix a word
111	1	yes many tribes rely upon western systems or at least aspire to we dont have enough times to tackle this one but one shortcoming in modern tribal structures can be the lack of an independent judiciary
112	1	just out of sheer curiosity are you always this suspicious about people who post and write in this sub
113	1	much like the daily show in its prime cracked articles can be some of the most thoughtprovoking investigative journalism ever written because its authors investigate research and verify the facts presented to its audience kudos to robert evans and tamlin mcgee for going out and writing this
114	1	which is referred to as an asshole move
115	1	many tribes have established their own police departments wherein the tribes do the hiring and managing with some funds and assistance from bia and doj bia police often provide law enforcement on reservations where the tribe does not have its own police department
116	1	blood quantum also with colonial roots think of british blue bloods has racialized what it means to be indigenous or tribal it has in fact made us racist think of us referring to each other as half bloods mixed bloods 164th mixed race indipino white looking etc
117	1	thank you for your review of the movie it is much appreciated  my immediate family has collectively made the decision to wait for it to come out on netflix or something similar but im all for reading others reviews and thoughts about it until that time comes
118	1	gabe galanda im with you there the nooksack disenrollment happened he promised to followup with rindiancountry later
119	1	it looks like tribal councilperson linda hughesoleary sponsored the the cherokee nation marriage and family protection act of 2004 and it appears that she still represents district 5  delaware and ottawa counties you can contact her to tell her what you thinkpo box 7 jay ok 74346phone 918 2534544email lindahughesolearycherokeeorg
120	1	not op but here you gohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzziyikhm9gwampfeatureshare
121	1	the article explained that the movement continues to grow because of the movements ability to broadcast its own messageif in fact the government is interfering with that message getting out then it is worth investigating there are many instances where this has happened in other places this article also highlights a lot of evidence showing that it is likely to be happening at standing rock there is even the wire shark simulation using the gathered datasure you could write it off as essentially user error if all users are getting the same error at the same time it becomes less likely that users are solely to blameif this is true it probably is the government is breaking the first amendment yet again in another way on behalf of corporations on sovereign native land it is not like this is something new entirely it fits neatly into the historical relationships first nation people have had to endure while dealing with colonizerswe havent begun to see the real crack down yet if its going to comei read that supposedly on jan 1 if oil isnt going through the pipe line that the contract expires meaning there is no reason for this pipeline to be built there is a good chance that december will be the key month of battle and things may get real ugly quick i hope they do notit is good that the veterans have showed up but the government lashes out on veterans all the same read about the bonus armyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikibonus_army
122	1	yo that is awesome thanks for the knowledge interesting how the clan tribe mentality always persists here the gangs generally go by village and in school w hung out with our relatives or the vill school fights played it that way too even if you werent in a gang if your village friends fight you do as well riots were either by race ethnicity or village inter village stuff was man to man    my bro got  jumped once and the next day cousins i barely even knew were telling me they were down to riot lol
123	1	i can see how people would confuse it with an honorable if joking title
124	1	alternatives to blood quantum include lineal descent residential requirement and cultural affiliation none are easy to implement but all are preferable to blood quantum
125	1	youre saying tribal police are better to the public than bia
126	1	either she or facebook must have pulled the post it has not yet been picked up by the blogs or news here is a cached versionhttpswebcachegoogleusercontentcomsearchqcacherkrvpvfk74jhttpswwwfacebookcomjacquelinetraverseposts10154060851321806ampcd1amphlenampctclnkampglus
127	1	an easement gives its holder the right to use landwater a certain wayhere it would be to cross the river with the pipeline
128	1	thanks once again i appreciate your input surprised to see you write that a disney movie taught you about polynesians please dont take that the wrong way however maybe you should accept that in the spirit of aloha and careful considerations ive seen you write previously that polynesian cultures interests you feel free to pm me let me know if there any way i can be of service to offer any resources related edit to add also feel free to check out a couple subreddits i started for my own personal journey of learning more language music dance current events and other things often unseen in the main stream related to hawaiian culture rhawaiidocumentaryrtalkstory
129	1	itd odd how all the criticism is cannedit is all the same few statements repeated over and over they get free education and dont use it all people do on reserves is drink and all their leaders are corrupt and stealing all the money
130	1	the fort sill apache tribe are chiricahua they are geronimo is band
131	1	gt we havent begun to see the real crack down yet if its going to comeoh it is going to come november 8th just about guaranteed it
132	1	i too am in support of advancing astronomy i do however think that other projects in the works are already planned to be larger than the tmt perhaps even more advanced when construction ends the eelt in chile looks quite impressivehttpwwwesoorgpublicusatelesinstreelti am unsure if any indigenous people is are in opposition to it that is something ill research a bit further i believe something immense needs to shift in a very dynamic way to address all of the worldly challenges you mentioned i dont have any grand solutions that seem feasible on a world wide scale i do however have fearless faith in humanity to begin the process of actively engaging oneself to make changes and also form dynamic communities that a working towards similar aspirations maybe all of this political turmoil is some form of catalyst for the us to wake the f up and start opening more minds im actually amazed in a positive way at how many people i interact with that are very much waking up to some uncomfortable truths theyve long been oblivious to a great majority of them are making changes i once doubted they would ever make i see inspirational transitions taking place amidst the chaos i believe that the youth of today are extremely instrumental in bringing about many of these long overdue shifts and i agree with you in that weve gotten ourselves into quite a pickle
133	1	once you start looking for them youll start seeing them everywhere but ive noticed completely nonklan businesspeople adopted the csintoksfornoreason naming practice probably because it is so ubiquitous
134	1	oh yeah theyre gonna build 3000 miles of wall on top of the already ridiculous idea that is planned for the border nobody is naive enough to think the fight is completely over but at least were not delusional like you
135	1	i dont think op is endorsing that but it just strikes me as odd how we get asian supremacists black people claiming theyre indigenous to the americas and religious zealots saying were hebrews i mean what is next
136	1	one of their most viewed articleshttpwwwcrackedcomarticle_19864_6ridiculousliesyoubelieveaboutfoundingamericahtml written by their editorinchief
137	1	basically there is a missing member on the census roll that was these 306 members ancestor they cant find her name on the 1942 census so her descendants dont meet the requirements of the enrollment code really it is a political thing i think of course i am not a part of nooksack or their tribal council but there are big families and when youre voting for tc it matters there is also limited resources for tribal members and tribes are very socialist  healthcare scholarships etc so maybe they feel like they need to cut back on members the tribe im from has what people derogatorily call casino indians it is the people that came to enroll when the tribe started doing well and having money people look down upon that pretty heavily im not sure if that is happening here
138	1	no worries i guess i just hate any suggestion that he is our father or any other close association to us
139	1	but are they saying to report the guy who found it or simply the fact that it was found if it is the latter that was already suggested in one or both of the crossposted subs if it is the former i cant imagine why as there is no indication that he disturbed the skull or the location
140	1	the us agreed to pay the debt then made a quiet announcement while people were still recovering from a situation the us created
141	1	at nooksack it isnt really about blood quantum they amended the constitution to remove criteria that my folks satisfied and they ignore other criteria that they still satisfy it isnt about the constitution or any notion of truth it is about vendetta
142	1	right the crack down is likely to happen dec 5  jan 1 the day the veterans leave to the day the contract supposedly expires
143	1	her first fantasy book was called demon drums it is off amazon for 4httpswwwamazoncomdemondrumscarolseverancedp0345374487refsr_1_1ieutf8ampqid1481129515ampsr81ampkeywordsdemondrumscarol took care with some aspects of polynesian culture in hawaii an emphasis is placed on song and oral tradition as well as writing in native culture so when carol is characters want to cast a spell in her books they dont point magic wands they sing and gesture like dancers they whisper into their hands and place it into the water for water magic or they sing into the air for storm magic or they hum a song while applying salve to make wounds heal better i think it is actually cool the way she depicts it and her worldbuilding and some other wellknown authors have commented that carol has been criminally ignored not even hawaii knew much about her and they normally celebrate locals who make it big i havent read many authors who is attempted to branch outside of the wand casts magic missile version of magic in fantasy probably because it is hard to do i might copy her someday in that regard full disclosure my mother and some of my friends took her writing course a couple were hawaiian they all said she was a hard teacher had her favorites and was apparently gunshy of anyone who had talent approaching hers as many teachers do she was hired because uh liked the prestige of hiring published authors as all colleges do but she was more geared toward academia than writing and i wasnt aware of anything she published while she was teaching i understand she died a few years ago
144	1	would you have different feelings about it if wilson wrote fiction inspired by osage history or traditional stories in other words is a modern depiction of your tribe less problematic than an attempt at historicizing or mythologizing
145	1	ok i guess we will agree to disagree lol a call homewwwchiricahuaapacheorgacallhomehtml
146	1	hey were descended from the atlanteans just like our hyborianage brethren from cimmeria
147	1	id absolutely love to read what you are willing and able to share i am always curious for further information you or anyone can provide regarding personal encounters with tutu pele i deeply respect availability to read  and hear stories of those with personal connections and understanding of tutu
148	1	yeah we will probably end up getting more mysterious illnesses because of this plus that is a bunch of crazy bastards that are moving here not good at all
149	1	it is been revoked  give it back  clearly you cant be trusted
150	1	thank you there are dozens of anonymous imitators and imposters out there
151	1	the canoe family always tries to implement lushootseed in some elements
152	1	i actually figuredguessed it that out because my dad and his brothers were really bugged that conan the barbarian was played by arnold schwarzenegger because in the comics he looked like an indian to themand he doeshttpimgurcomajqk9yz long story short we are implied to be descended from atlanteans in the conan stories along with the cimmerians the american indians shown in the comics have a lot in common with the cimmerians in terms of culture appearance and for some reason language
153	1	how is it cleaned is the outer skin removed or just cleaned by washing it
154	1	the national congress of american indians just put out a press release too
155	1	im just really sick to death of the government colluding with big business to strip native americans of land that by all rights should be theirs ive hated the reservation system way back to when i first learned about it the us government really should cede ownership of the lands to native americans
156	1	it is a protest kit  shhhhh
157	1	yes this 100
158	1	youre most welcome thank you
159	1	so are the chiricahua
160	1	really my memory says it was 10 or at least it felt like i was getting reamed that hard in the process
161	1	they will steal more sacred land and destroy it
162	1	any links you can provide about the recent oil spill asides from those ive already linked would be most appreciated information is powerful share what you have please
163	1	all good points i believe that perceived resilience to be a fa√ßade and one that was never constructed on firm foundations like you mention and i agree the last grasp indeed power and wealth are taking on new meanings and i think this is the time to redefine
164	1	the profession can definitely impact your health the stress of the profession can certainly impact you in a negative way i am by no means the healthiest person but i try to exercise and eat well and i maintain a clean and sober lifestyle the profession is certainly feasible for longterm employment the gratitude and gratification of indian clients even in times of loss makes it all worthwhile
165	1	if you can provide me with a link to that official statement from the bank id be very grateful the article i linked does make clear it is fhb parent company with investments
166	1	lawyering especially indian lawyering is very taxing that is because of the gravity of the rights at stake so it does require a tremendous amount of stamina physically mentally and spiritually passion helps fuel stamina
167	1	you aint gotta state your bq like itll somehow further justify your words just so you knowgtthe people who did evil things to natives are long deadnatives were being covertly sterilized by ihs in the 70s native religions were illegal until only 1978 people are still alive today who have seen their lands flooded by the army core of engineers and then lose jurisdiction over it people from the termination era are still alive and some churches still work toward demonizing indian cultures and assimilating nativesyeah the people who do evil things to natives are not long dead people in the 16th 17th 18th and 19th centuries were not the only ones who committed evil deedswhat is even more is that the people who suffered these things are still alive there are plenty of elders still around who went through the boarding schools
168	1	gt also orange father is hilariousthanks it came from somewhere between the last ama and uhwm2666 is circle on facebookorange nixon is probably the best we can hope for
169	1	hi there ive had to approve your comment it appears your account has been shadowbanned not by us contact the admins if you want to inquire about itadditionally as my rebuttal to your comment please understand that the article has nothing to do with the election it is an appeal from a tribe to the current president to release an innocent man and quite frankly his chances of clemency are better under obama than they will be under trump
170	1	i was wondering about this after i read about it earlier for some tribes this could be the greatest thing ever or disaster for others it seems for indian country there is no fix all for any issue
171	1	insofar as one can read emotion from a bureaucratic statement yes the important point to note is that if shareholder money was really at stake they would be investigating alternative routes not saying the line will go through no matter what quite frankly i suspect a certain amount of collusion between the government and the companies and that this is something of a bluff to defuse what has become a very rapidly growing movement
172	1	not sure but it is quite worth questioning
173	1	oh i totally agree with that it is pathetic i didnt mean for my words to come off referencing that reasoningi meant as in they literally thought they didnt had a choice whether they were blinded by their ideology religion racism or whatever not that being blinded by those things means their actions are excusable or justified but typically the bottom rung people are victims themselvesthe warrior tradition for western people is as you know quite different from ours their warriors often do not think for themselves the doctrines theyve developed based on their ideology may seek out the irrational the racists the warmongers the extremists but only when it benefits them it seems to me though that it often preys upon those with good intentions  the patriot who just wants to do some good for their people and country it works on cultivating nationalism the bad kind like the supremacy kind within that person then to develop that into a blind faith it doesnt want independent thinkers because they challenge the authority rather than the person who was just following orders it wants the person who didnt even think there was a second option in the first placeit just so happens that they often get the befehl ist befehl in the end though both types usually serve their role and are discarded and both types are guilty of their crimes im just saying that i can understand extending forgiveness to some but would i id have to wait until that time to make the call speaking for myself
174	1	fort sill apache tribe of oklahoma are already recognizedthanks to mildred cleghornand the mescalero apache tribe who include many chiricahua are also recognized
175	1	i cannot speak to the tunicabiloxi tribe of louisiana in particular without context so i wont but generally speaking some tribal communities have lost the indigenous capacity to provide checks and balances against human rights violations two centuries of genocidal federal indian law and policytreaties allotment assimilation boarding schools reorganization termination even socalled selfdeterminationhave destroyed that capacity that is why the federal trustee and all of indian country must band together to help devise a cure to what ails and threats to kill us as american indian peoples
176	1	especially after watching the morton county police and the nd governor simultaneously have press conferences demonizing the water protectors this morning it was like they were saying hey everybody here is why we are about to use force
177	1	washing
178	1	baker just cant keep his hand out of trying to promote himself poltical within the us systemwe always figured he would try again to get elected in state or federal level but never thought he would stoop to this level
179	1	good to know
180	1	i mean i get his name can have different implications with different people buttnod
181	1	third id say color me surprisedthe practical part of me recognizes that they want to tap into the residual interest in indian country justice issues topically related to nodapl
182	1	yeah its a tiny minority with wealth though
183	1	what is the distinction between tribal police and bia
184	1	legally speaking i know that a court cannot impose icwa without reasonbut for the sake of argument let is transition out of legal reasoning and into the plains of common sense if the child was why is now the child not one has to ask what now is the child quasiindian explain to a 10 year old your mother indian but you are not i digress thank you so much for your time and for the link
185	1	im always an advocate for having fearless faith that anything is possible i am an individual who thinks we should be mindful before saying never one amazing example of never say never the kanaka reoccupation and struggles victories that took place on the island of kaho ªolawe to stop all military activities httpsyoutube5fjzhyzcaoagranted that is a bit of a long video to watch highly recommended all the same if and when you have time heres another much shorter video you might have seen before regarding sovereignty and independence httpsyoutubedackyrvkv0anything by kaleikoa kaeo is inspiration to me personally edit to add for clarity
186	1	i do that what of me
187	1	that is the thing that confuses me when people talk about canadians they come off as the complete opposite of exceedingly polite and kind when i go see my brother in alberta
188	1	i also see significant signs of waking up and on the other hand an incredible resilience of the old guard reagan bush ii and now trump have in turn seemed to me certain to be the last gasp of the dinosaursas my good friend tom atlee says things are getting better and better and worse and worse faster and faster or teilhard de chardin back in 1950 we only have to look around us to see how complexity and psychic temperature are still rising and rising no longer on the scale of the individual but now on that of the planet this indication is so familiar to us that we cannot but recognize the objective experiential reality of a transformation of the planet as a whole
189	1	thank you you can kindly refer to me as a sister and i didnt interpret your comment as such but for me personally this subject i posted is deeply disturbing and to further the disturbance my local state subreddit is full of misunderstandings and upvoted rhetoric that is sadly quite common when it comes to cultural kanaka issues
190	1	it is a disney movie which meant i had no interest in seeing it until i noticed everyone in my class at the tribal college wanted to go it has the usual believe in yourselfdont afraid to be differentnever give up horsecrap that is in every disney movie even including the marvel ones there is no real violencebattles it is disney and it has two animal sidekicks i really shouldnt have liked this movie as much as i dobut the songs are catchy to me maui chooses to be a warrior towards the end and i learned about polynesians
191	1	the book linked is from 2001 long before tmt so where is the quote from
192	1	very interesting ill definitely check it out
193	1	so youre interested in weeaboos rjustneckbeardthings must be your favorite sub
194	1	good question indeed from what ive gathered thus farthe la palma site where tmt is being reproposed is not vacant it is the sacred mountain of the benahoaritas the last indigenous guanches an ancient berber people who were there for thousands of years who were almost wiped out but from whom many of the island is living people are descended the mountain is the site of the last standoff against spain the same year that columbus was making trouble in north america some are active and do not want tmt eitherlet ªs be clear it is not enough to remove this project from mauna kea and build it on someone else is sacred land astronomy needs to evolve and stop destroying our earth to look at the sky periodhttpswwwamazoncomguanchessurvivorstheirdescendantsdp8492052759
195	1	every indigenous person should have a general understanding of the written laws especially the supreme written laws of their tribal communityeg treaty executive order constitution and of the unwritten lawsie tribal custom and tradition because those laws and ways govern how we as tribal communities function and survive
196	1	im not against the gesture i mean i posted it i just dont know im so far removed from things in a way yet still get so angry on the other hand perhaps because they still have their cultures that they can forgive
197	1	hell yeah time to start feeding
198	1	also see httpwwwpipelineaccidentshappencom
199	1	yes he is a staunch democrat his mother is big in the state scene he is also the one who publicly endorsed hillary and even set up at tent at that dncwell that doesnt look good for us cherokees now that we have a full republican govt he is just being a political whore and trying to gain any sort of political allies or friends to propel himself in the futurei never liked the guy but never thought he would stoop to this level
200	1	crackedcom has become a solid website mostly for it is humor and pop culture commentary but they dont shy away from serious news if the writer has something to say
201	1	that may have been the most efficient boycott in history
202	1	in addition to knowing so much personal information about an individual i always find it strange when someone posts the exact same comment 6 times in less than an hour to multiple subreddits

204	1	i love the canoe family
205	1	i dont know what else to say  the chiricahua nation is not federally recognized  that is a legal statement of fact that has its own legal implications and explanations the chiricahua is historical territorial range did not include oklahoma yet they are enrolled in the ft sill tribe  our argument for federal recognition would have included a historical land base in arizona and new mexico historical range included mexico but this was limited to historical range within the us  there is no federally recognized tribe that comprehensively encompasses the historical territorial range of the chiricahua navajo may he enrolled in multiple tribes but the navajo nation itself is huge
206	1	nooksack indians hail from southern british columbia and northern washington of course before there was  uscanadian border matsqui was a village chief in canada but in united states records the us recognized him as nooksack marie was a member of matsqui is tribe hailing from the canadian village madeline became his next wife and then was allotted land in northern washington state the wonderful thing about most nooksack citizens is that they are american citizens canadian citizens nooksack citizens and first nations citizens nooksack is a predominately matrilineal society to my knowledge adoption has a longstanding tradition at nooksack in fact the current chairman and his family who have no nooksack blood or ancestry were adopted into the tribe
207	1	i think it is an ok way of mocking the president elect i personally cant think of names that arent a bit more blunt than necessary
208	1	soooo getting sitting bull on my butt is out i take itd
209	1	that is simply not how tribes work ive have ever heard anyone from the fort sill apache tribe express a desire to form a new chiricahua nation everyone i know in that tribe are very proud of their own history and interested in developing their lands in oklahoma and new mexico
210	1	i wish i would have known about plsi before law school what an amazing network of indigenous lawyers as to the legal profession i have no regrets about not knowing certain things about it i came in eyes wide open and my eyes remain wide open each and every day
211	1	here is a linkhttpssoundcloudcombreakdanceswithwolvesep9wthedisenrollmentepisodewgabegalandaattorneygalandabroadman to a podcast i was able to do with the lawyer fighting for the disenrolled  the current tribal council has been in office for longer than their term which expired in march  they tried to bar those set to be disenrolled from voting in the upcoming election knowing that their vote would bring in members who didnt want to follow through with the disenrollment  the current council went so far as to postpone the election process and also fired a nooksack tribal court judgehttpswwwbellinghamheraldcomnewslocalarticle73366262html who ruled in january that the tribe couldnt bar any current members from voting
212	1	right right my bad i get the stories mixed up sometimes yknow

215	1	to be honest i couldnt read this without crying im a doctor of psychology i specialize in substance abuse addiction i lived in oklahoma and had everything set i had been working with an old professor of mine and was looking into getting a job working at the indian hospital all i wanted to do was help my people but i cant stop my own addiction long enough to even help myself i just want people to understand that this is a very real problem especially for our people you can be a doctor you can be a fast food worker you can be a school teacher it doesnt matter anymore people need to understand that this epidemic doesnt just attack a certain type of people opiates can attach themselves to anyone and the thing about it it is extremely easy to hide what is worse people dont think it is that bad because it is a pill or a drug the doctor gives you that makes it even worse
216	1	thank you kindly  the first link shows up and the second one does not
217	1	at a minimum we must ensure independent tribal judiciaries anchored by strong laws
218	1	well i used to go to the polynesian cultural center in oahu when i would go to hawaii with my familybut i didnt really pay attention each time the last time i was in hawaii was 2013 and that was just a year after i discovered that my people didnt just live in tipis we had longhouse and pithouses as well i was really clueless about my people for a long time so i started researching heavily after seeing a book about my cultural group and eventually ended finding out stuff about different cultures along the way with the same zeali find odd ways to get interested in cultures
219	1	oh yeah i hope i wasnt coming across as being supportive of such behavior and im really sorry if it did i was just saying that was a bad comparison given mt rushmore is history im fully against people disrespecting sacred objects i wont even watch the maze runner movies after the actors talked about taking indigenous artifacts during filming nothing but love and respect from me brother
220	1	except it isnt the debt of the united states the harm was caused by the japanese government america liberated the island america is looking to pay japan is debtsomething else to consider that you may consider being screwed is that the funds will come from funds guam would have received anyway

225	1	i am more than happy to learn the cultural history of specific tribes of whatever area id be assigned to and learn their norms i have a lot of experience traveling and ive lived with indigenous people in south america i understand how to be sensitive to cultural differences so i dont think this would be an issue for me
226	1	thanks for the update it is good to see that the company backed down i hope the local agent doesnt run into any future trouble because he had a conscience
227	1	i think a modern depiction is less prone to problems yes that is not to say that i dont think a nonnative could do a respectful and accurate historical or mythological treatment just that there are more pitfalls when doing so but if somebody native or not did do a respectful and accurate take on traditional stories i would be quite happy to see it
228	1	is that a link to the music i will see if there is anything i can find outside of you tube
229	1	it is so gross that people especially canadians romanticize canada to the extent they do theyll go on and on about how tolerant they are and how racism isnt a thing here but then bring up natives and they foam at the mouth settlers of colour will even partake in itit is just disgusting
230	1	ah didnt notice that i can share the sentiment but even id be cool with a republican if they decided to help indians
231	1	that is harsh even i wouldnt be able to to get that letter how does canada treat it still 50

242	1	i wasnt using my nb as weight only as context where im from every native is mixed blood norwegian irish russian even still there is a lot of racism against white people among natives even ordinary white people who have nothing to do with racism
243	1	blessings for you and your family i too am in similar situations and coming to terms with kupuna passing on
244	1	no but we did have to schedule it for first thing in the morning
245	1	let is headoff any attempt by her or anyone else to invoke the magic teflon forcefield of citing political correctness by stating that what she said had zerozilchnothing at all to do with that since she wasnt bluntly but honestly stating something with which people are uncomfortable and try to avoid there is being politically incorrect and being just plain flat out fucked up jennifer lawrence was the latter she was essentially saying these rocks are sacred to hawaiians and i dont know why well whatever my ass needed scratching oh those quaint and silly primitives with their provincial superstitions i wonder if shed have done that if she was being filmed at plymouth rock anyone taking bets if shed try to light a fart on fire with the eternal flame at arlington national cemetary

252	1	you do know that the court ie the judicial branch is part of the government right
253	1	stay off the ludes son
254	1	i just think that there are too many barriers to actual independence i think indigenous rights are the best we can accomplish as long as a western international power exists
255	1	was it a pig
256	1	this link ive provided you with does contain her online apology it is my understanding that waimea stewards are requesting a formal apology as well and as it reads to me personally not a snarky apology at that
257	1	youre kidding me im metis im a big scifi fan and i didnt know there was a podcast called metis in space for shamethat is a really interesting point about modern social realities reflected in pretty lighthearted fare  and to be honest while moana jumped out at me as indigenous fiction it never crossed my mind to put lilo and stitch in the same category but it absolutely is
258	1	set my man chakotay up for some borg hanky panky resistance is futile native
259	1	the company has now backed down
260	1	could you please eli5 for me does this mean tribal lands and sovereignty are at stake
261	1	as would i i saw the comment took a quick look at his posting history and drew my conclusion if we have his support i will gladly apologize but to me it didnt sound like we do
262	1	when i first started hearing about how bad rcanada was i was in disbelief went there for several threads and found out how many of them really feel about natives really disappointing for a sub of a country that everyone holds in such high regards in seemingly every aspect
263	1	exactly imagine telling any ten year old who has been raised his or her entire life thinking they are tribal that they are not tribal any longer simply because some tribal politician said so
264	1	mahalo nui loa for the heartfelt expression i honor you for sharing all that you have with me  this is where true dialog evolves and perhaps even long term solutions begin without any hesitations i must express time is needed for me to internalize this before offering a personal reply youve presented me a lot to consider it seems quite hasty and even maybe inconsiderate of me to immediate respond without some time to pass and my personal emotions about the topic to settle
265	1	ive also got a bunch of beads will beads work
266	1	trump supporters will only cry that natives are practicing reverse racism by not allowing their sports teams to have racist symbols
267	1	youre reading that correctly the channel is part of the black africans are the true hebrews movement
268	1	there are 20 distinct pomo tribes meanwhile over a dozen ethnic groups belong to the single confederated tribes of siletz indians federally recognized tribes dont conform to ethnic lines they are historical and political entitiesthe more i think about about it it is actually rare for an entire ethnic group to belong a single tribe maybe the quapaw kaw and comanche even navajos are enrolled in three different tribes
269	1	isnt he a democrat im sure he is happy to be rid of her locally but what a stupid move fallin is daughter is headdress pic was obnoxious but fallin not supporting iwca and allowing the capobiancos to steal baby veronica from her birth father and his father is unforgivable
270	1	huh i didnt even realize this wasnt the first story about this on the subyeah if variants of this story keep popping up a wapato isnt potato even ffs it is arrowroot or something seems legit
271	1	thank you for the 11 seconds video you have linked ive been duck duck go david choe and from what i gather thus far he is an amazing artist and an individual who has gained a large sum of money via facebook stock from years go i may be off a bit as im completely not solid in that answer amp still personally asking for further information as you know i think all support is tremendous i was initially asking op for more information as i was personally unclear how to effectively flair the post but i do however thank you personally for providing the 11 seconds video much appreciated all the same
272	1	agreed i like that approach
273	1	legal passage through the land they have jurisdiction over stuff is always up in the air with the feds but it seems like weve won this fight
274	1	chris pratt who lived as a homeless dude in hawaii for a couple years also looked uncomfortable as she was telling the story it is a safe bet that he knew not to fuck around with what the hawaiians say to not fuck around with and didnt think it was funny that she treated them as oogah boogah sacred rocks
275	1	i just got done with a week long trip through navajo country  lots of stories about the ancient ones as they call them there ill definitely check it out and would also be interested in hearing navajo or pueblo reviews of the book
276	1	leonard peltier was imprisoned for a crime he didnt commit regarding the killing of the fbi agents not for killing annie mae one wrong does not make another right
277	1	almost every disney film revolves around orphans or children running away to defy their parents it is the formula that worked before again and again so they are not keen on changing the poor orphan scenario i just wanted to throw that in there for fyi purposes i include pinocchio the parentless wooden boy who wasnt really an orphan
278	1	i hope a formal complaint was filed as well the women in the video was telling someone on the phone what i think was an address perhaps she was on the phone with police
279	1	very true
280	1	um fun stuff yeah fun stuff
281	1	thank you for examining this crucial issue i hope you will publish your research findings yes generally speaking disenrollment destroys the indian status of tribal children therefore rendering icwa inapplicableconsider the words of my brothers at last real indians we most certainly do not exclude our indian children it is horrible to think that a lakota child would lose the protections afforded by the federal indian child welfare act upon his or her disenrollmenthttplastrealindianscomlastrealindiansdenouncesdisenrollment
282	1	i get itmoana wasnt that way but i still sincerely wish the other stories a painful and miserable end
283	1	i came across this article somewhat related you might like to check out httpwwwcivilbeatorg201612cantheseislandssurviveamericasmilitarypivottoasia
284	1	if you think this alleged racism against whites is a systematic or widespread problem and that ordinary white people dont have a hand in the systematic abuses that occur todaylolololol
285	1	what is in a riot kit
286	1	i am not sure how you define when you say humanoid but many of the gods and goddesses do have human forms but each also is embodied in plants animals specific land formations forms of water weather events and much more it is quite intricate honestly and as im learning each day more and more i can offer a bit of information an excerpt to help me explain betterthere are over 400000 different gods recognized in hawaiian culture  these include the principal deities demigods  ªaumakua ancestral gods and many lesser akua gods  each had their own realm of influence over some aspect of hawaiian society  in this pantheon of akua were those who had greater k≈´leanaresponsibilities such as war or politics and others with less important roles  not all akua hawai ªi hawaiian gods were worshiped by each individual  gods varied from place to place and from island to island  gods also differed according to a persons area of expertise for example a canoe maker wouldnt necessarily pray to the gods of hula dance for support and vice versa  there were however some deities and spiritual beliefs that all hawaiians adhered to regardless of status or classlisted below are the major gods collectively known as ka hƒÅ lit the four that influenced every aspect of the hawaiian world  they were equally revered amongst all islands in ancient times and are recognized throughout polynesia as some of the most powerful gods in oceaniain this list readers will find the common name for each god along with their sphere of influence  also included are some of the main kinolau belonging to each akua  kinolau literally means many forms  they are the physical manifestations of an akua and even though they often take the form of a plant or animal kinolau are not limited to only flora and faunahttpwwwnorthshoreecotourscomnaakuahawaiiangods here is a bit of information about some of the more prominent kanaloa and kƒÅne specifically take human form in addition to other things  kanaloa httpwwwkumukahiorgunitske_ao_akuaakuakanaloa kƒÅnehttpwwwkumukahiorgunitske_ao_akuaakuakane k≈´this particular god can take a vast array of forms k≈´maunak≈´ of the mountain a rain god of ka ª≈´ hawai ªik≈´ka ª≈ç ª≈çk≈´ of the digging stick god of farmingk≈´keolowaluk≈´ of wet land farmingk≈´ ªulakaik≈´ of the abundant sea god of fishingk≈´mokuhƒÅli ªik≈´ god of canoe buildersk≈´nuiƒÅkeak≈´ god of governmentk≈´kƒÅ ªilimokuk≈´ snatcher of islands a feathered war godk≈´wahailok≈´ god of sorceryhttpwwwkumukahiorgunitske_ao_akuaakuaku lono  god of agriculture and rain also taking on many forms of kinolau plant embodiment httpwwwkumukahiorgunitske_ao_akuaakualono  then there are kupua dual formed person demigod  kamapuaa most known as a pig kupua here is one story about him as peles lover httpwwwcoffeetimescomkamapuaahtm here is a collection of resources related to many kupuahttpmanoahawaiieduhawaiiancollectionlegendssubjectsearchphpqkupua20demigods many deities are associated with specific places such as mauna kea here are a few of those httpwwwmaunaawakeainfomaunakeaf1_mtndeitieshtml that brings us to hƒÅloa the first born man with deep ties to kalo taro and mauna kea here is a simplified version of the complicated but incredibly beautiful genealogy story httpwwwkumukahiorgunitska_hikinahaloa
287	1	reagan and bush ii were clearly not the last gasp because here we are and people have been preaching the imminent end of capitalism for over 100 years now im not saying the foundations are firm but it is impressive how strong it is able to look as the foundations keep shifting and crumbling part of what we need is greater recognition and visibility for the large and growing notforprofit portion of the economy
288	1	thanks yeah ive watched a lot of great docs on youtube and tried to get in touch with the ones that seem like they might have traceable sources  because ill need highquality video and wont be able to use material without getting permission to use in my doc
289	1	the tribe provide enough resources to create a tribal police dept but sometimes they dont have enough resources to patrol all the necessary areas so they use the assistance of bia police is that what youre getting at
290	1	gt we would appreciate a personal apology from ms lawrence for her continued insensitive remarks on a culturally sensitive mattershe apologized in a brief facebook post i checked the article on rnativeamerican which i find kinda cheap and get off my back alreadyish she said she was trying to be selfdeprecating but i couldnt see where that was supposed to come in
291	1	cleaned boiled eaten it is stringy and greatly resembled onions when i last had it which made me cautious of eating them as i am a very picky eater
292	1	yeah the headline got me really excited about the trade network that potatoes in bc at that time implied but then i got to engineered wetlands and was like oh indian potatoesstill a very cool discovery
293	1	can you expand on some of her students thoughts im also really interested in your take on the epic fantasy series  im assuming that parts of the culture were tweaked a bit to fit into the genre  is that right if so how did you feel about the changes
294	1	hahahahayeah in past years i saw one that looked like a fried burger from five guys and another that looked like a golf hatthe frybread situation was grotesque
295	1	is this those israel united in christ dudes
296	1	probably not but the effort has to be made anyhow
297	1	that wont get anyone anywhere i agree with uoneknotforalot
298	1	yes but the chiricahua on their own do not have federal recognition
299	1	3 as to tribal kinshipcitizenshipmembership there is a void of due process and of protection for other fundamental rights there is a void of check and balance we all bear the responsibility as individuals as tribal kinmemberscitizens as nationstate citizens of advocating for a fair system in which everyone is right to belong is held sacred and is protected
300	1	it is a portion of the deeper principles of aloha something i strive on many levels to understand and institute daily not always easy to be honest
301	1	no ive not in my experience nagrpa has fallen short in protecting tribal ancestors in public and private lands
302	1	thanks for the reply  im interested in the filipino cultures along with other austronesian speakers primarily because of my connection to them but also some middle eastern peoples as well
303	1	for me in today is times attention to the slightest details is of most importance when combined with the spirit of aloha
304	1	thank you for sharing this   this is horrible
305	1	that is true
306	1	you are absolutely right this isnt the end but it is an imporant victory that we need give thanks for i am thrilled about it
307	1	some tribes do so by measuring the number of trips members take back home others do so through indigenous language competence any measure of belonging is a sticky wicket but there are certainly alternative measures that are preferable to blood quantum
308	1	good thing we have credit unions like becu that are 100x better than banks in all respects
309	1	gt but borrowing early 20th western moviespeak seems to inserts an unnecessarydistracting kink in the conversationim conflicted on thiscome inauguration ill likely revise my posting history on this again depending on whether the electoral college does its hamiltonian duty per federalist no 68httpavalonlawyaleedu18th_centuryfed68aspyour reservations are entirely valid and fwiw to additionally communicate that i value your input ive done nothing but upvote you heremore discretion might be warranted moving forward
310	1	oh shit my bad im really killing it in this thread i understand what you mean sometimes rdenver can say some really ignorant stuff regarding natives it is also for this reason i would recommend staying away from rnorthdakota too
311	1	protestyeah i meant protest
312	1	ive seen it twice i really really liked the movie it comes off as a traditional story when you reflect on the story i didnt know anything about polynesian sailing voyaging or that there were even pigs in their villagesmaui in the movie reminds me greatly of a figure in my people is legends duk ∑ib…ô…´kwati which translates to the changertransformer however i have a couple disagreements with tƒìvita is review about the characters maui isnt a god in the movie he is explicitly a demigod with human parents i have zero clue how that works as im not familiar with polynesian theology  tƒìvita calls maui misogynistic im assuming due to a 10ish second debate with moana on whether or not she is a princess she is the daughter and heir of a village chieftain he actually seems much more patronizing towards mortals in general tƒìvita also ignores the reasoning behind maui is conceited personality abandonment issues and being a demigod that has provided mankind many useful gifts and how he gets over itis genealogy particularly important in polynesian legends he seems to make it a bit of big deal when discussing the female characters
313	1	i would love to hear more on your thoughts on how changing tribal governance structures would help developments
314	1	what is your opinion on this ive always been a big supporter of native hawaiian issues but idk i feel like we should built this telescope so long as we do it right so it is not polluting and the aina is respected i think this is a great investment for future generations what better way to honor our ancestors than to study the same stars that led them to our islands not only that it could give new education opportunities to hawaiian kids and give a boost to our economy we badly need
315	1	governments exist to protect the owning class
316	1	very interesting thanks for sharing
317	1	she is clearly quoted earlies in the article saying the discovery is as important to us good job making sure no one is getting too proud of their culturethough
318	1	thank you he had nothing to do with anna mae i know the story and even the people whose house she was at in denver when aim came to get her which was the last time she was seen leonard had nothing to do with it
319	1	lol
320	1	cheerful singing orphan who gets all they wish for by lying and deceiving everyone they meet through the film and then they get to hook up with their chosen fantasy lover and are showered with wealth
321	1	as another commenter has mentioned these are two quite separate incidents the shooting of the fbi agents at wounded knee on the pine ridge rez was what peltier was charged with and convicted aquash is murder happened some time later and peltier was definitely not involved in it peltier is trial had enough legal errors on the part of the prosecution to convince many people that he was innocent of the first shooting as well
322	1	thank you for the reply im still personally perplexed
323	1	but they are not the legislative and the legaslative are the ones representing the people and these represantatives do not seem to have made much effort to work for equality here
324	1	do you guys have any humanoid gods the closest the chamoru people have is the brother and sister who created this world but even they are island and planets now everyone else is considered ancestors btw i watched the first part up until the singing and it is very reminiscent of one of our myths but opposite though i think ive mentioned this to you before
325	1	i need some more context for this one
326	1	im more interested in how the status vs nonstatus issues are treated and less on what an american status card could get you
327	1	i was wondering if there was something like a first nation news network so that tribes could continue the unity and solidarity in action that has been built through the dapl resistance and continue to be informed and support each other something visible on youtube perhaps does this already exist a news show for and about native americans this struggle showed how hard it was to get the message out from the perspective of native people it seems like it could help with unity and learning from what other tribes are dealing with and raising the discussion for all americans
328	1	how do you prepare it i have heard of places here that it grows wild but ive never tried it isnt it a corm similar to kalo taro
329	1	fucking opression olympics smhunfortunately one symptom of opression is uneducation which is something this moron your so dealth with seems to be suffering from
330	1	i never knew who she was until today and im not aware of who jesse is either i dont watch much on television or even movies
331	1	the idea of a tribal council having the power to disbar an attorney is insane in my opinion who can and cannot practice before the tribal court should be within the sole control of the court seems the court agreed but the council is acting like a spoiled child that didnt get its waythis disenrollment insanity needs to stop it is all about politics and will only inflict damage on the tribe is future
332	1	we did but that is not where i landed im in support of advancing astronomy generally im also very much in support of indigenous sovereignty so im curious if the latter effectively puts hard boundaries on the former given that tall mountains tend to be sacred to someone id be disheartened if it does as i find something spiritual in what is uncovered as we peer deeper into the universe even moreso with the prospect of identifying life elsewhere building equivalent telescopes in space or on other planets takes a lot of resources and would perhaps be impossible without even worse desecrationthat said this is a general challenge can we  and if so how  continue wonders such as the useful bits of western medicine computers amp networks etc while fully respecting local amp indigenous sovereignty and the natural world can we even survive i feel fairly certain that some parts of the solution are drastically curtailing the ridiculous overconsumption in the developed parts of the world and among upper classes everywhere developing the tech to reuse especially the more toxic substances weve already dug out of the earth is crust so that we can minimize or better eliminate further extraction and investing heavily in research toward replacing those substances wherever possible but it is not clear if that is enough and if so how long it would take to achieve all of that without a massive dieoff of human beings climate change adds significantly to the challenge though on the plus side at least it presents an obvious existential reason to aim for this transitionweve gotten ourselves into quite a pickleedit i didnt share all of this the last time we were talking about tmt so im grateful for the opportunity to do so now
333	1	my mistake it is from the protect mauna kea hui edit to add if i recall with accuracy you and i had a conversation once upon a time bout how you were in support somehow of the tmt project ujohnabbe feel free to correct me if im wrong but if indeed you are supportive of the tmt id very much enjoy reading your personal perspective edit agains to correct my autocorrect
334	1	the name is mentioned in the article from dm but seeing how theyre spamming this comment i think we know who we are dealing with
335	1	i worked for a small town law office in port angeles while in high school and community college the lawyers there practiced for the community and inspired me to go to law school and do the same
336	1	sorry but your post has been removed for violating rule 4httpswwwredditcomrindiancountryaboutrulesgt4 racial ethnic religious cultural tolerancegtnatives come from many different walks of life nowadays we also receive many different visitors while there is some tolerance allowed toward the highlighting of actions towards a groupreligion we must be balanced and display civility in this regardgtthis includes having intraracial tolerance having intertribal tolerance and having racialethnic tolerance we do not condone sexism racism racial purity cultural gatekeeping or stereotypingtake this as an official warning as well
337	1	indigenous rights and recognization of such have always been in place and practiced by the few  in today is times and not yet the many imo it is those that deeply understand and practice these traditions that are the true stewards of wealth and power i have come to believe that those two words and their definitions in western dialect are undergoing a real transformation and it sometimes seems indescribably threatening to others with their own personal definitions i find myself often now days contemplating how i personally define wealth and power researching understanding and asserting these rights is one of many catalysts in today is times  i can see there is still a very long journey that requires many many steps beyond im dedicated to the journey and for me fundamentally as a parent my fearless faith in the future has increased beyond any measure edit to add
338	1	glad you enjoyed itthe article came to me by recommendation of uhwm2666 onehalf of that awesome ama this weekhttpswwwredditcomrindiancountrycomments5fmk78okii_rindian_country_we_are_sterling
339	1	im hoping some coverage happens christi belcourt has been posting about it it is appalling
340	1	it is a law review article not a book but thank you for the kind endorsement the biggest thing each and every one of us can do to help stopdisenrollment is to talk about it the cancer that is disenrollment has spread to epidemic levels over the past two decades because of the taboo associated with the practice it is only through dialoguemore and more dialoguethat we will find a cure
341	1	a pig
342	1	im gonna go out on a guess and say it is an indicator that the skull was used for religious ceremonies by indians in the area

346	1	an important question
347	1	yeah i ate there when i was in dc on a visit about a year ago and i was super disappointed  nice to hear it is gotten better
348	1	i know that here on big island there is an annual event for makahiki season aha pule aina holo a prayer moving throughout the land families and friends gather to run around the island and support the runners in a relay of sorts but the running itself is in prayer hard to explain as there is many aspect to it but each year year the prayers evolve one of the amazing youth here lanakila mangauil inspired to bring back the ancient tradition a few years ago
349	1	hanow you have me wondering is it the most effective notnot spending of money to accomplish a policy goal in history or is it just one not in therei also wonder how much documentation or actual refusal of service was involved corporate can have their stance and declare what should not happen and what should be moving forward but i suspect were missing a lot here

352	1	i am pleased with the army corps denial but i fear it will not deter energy transfer partners from drilling under lake oahe and completing dapl
353	1	indeed for me personally yes
354	1	editorializing guilty for sureit seemed a fair compromise between being topical while keeping trump out of my posting history as much as possible for several reasonsyoure correct orange father does reference gwf i picked it up in one indigenous circle or the other it is not aping an 19th century referential and in the modern context ive never heard either uttered outside of contempt id like to hear more about the oddness of it as i thought it clever
355	1	i suppose that bears watching but the future will tell looking at it from the pov of the national company i dont think so insofar as the news is more likely to lose them customers than gain them any  and there is no basis for jacking up the price outside of the local area the local franchisee is as far as i can tell not vehemently opposed to the people at the camps and was quite upset when all the shit hit the fan if the reports of people who have met him are accurate i would say that he may increase the price to a moderate degree but hed be wary of any dramatic increase the bottleneck propane joke is supply in this game of nerves if he is unsympathetic he will underorder and any new stock will disappear quickly there will likely be government pressure on the suppliers to delay filling orders as long as is possible this bears watching as well
356	1	they dont need 3000 miles of wall just a few hundred miles at a time of chain link fence which can be easily moved you dont even need to build it you can literally rent the fence from companies and it costs only a few thousand dollars a day
357	1	on the one hand i will never forgive the institution and i have a hard time forgiving those who are willfully part of that institution but more so the leaders i can understand extending forgiveness to individuals particularly the rank and file who probably often thought they didnt have a choice

363	1	the infiltrator ran a blockade with a dapl company vehicle exited the vehicle with a rifle while dressed as a water protector pointed the rifle at people who took him as a threat and was then arrested by the bia police afterwards documents identifying him as a dapl employee were found in the truck the truck was brought up the road then torchedthis guy was obviously attempting to enter the camp to instigate something it put the lives of many innocent people in danger because the police couldve mistaken him for someone he was not and opened fire do not try to paint him as innocent

366	1	im sorry but i dont
367	1	oh i hate the fucker but borrowing early 20th western moviespeak seems to inserts an unnecessarydistracting kink in the conversation
368	1	and ive been in the it game since the days of punch cardsit is worth investigating further and not a waste of resources because it has been apparent that there have been law enforcement rf shenanigans since before the camps got so big since before the dapl burst on the publics consciousness before celebrity appearances and well before the news media began picking up on the story there were earlyon reports of periodic cell phone blackouts and disruptions along with some speculation that they were timed to appearances of aircraftthe social legal and constitutional ramifications of determining that law enforcement is openly or covertly engaged in electronic surveillance are unknownthe social legal and constitutional ramifications of determining that law enforcement is openly or covertly engaged in hacking and electronic warfare are also unknownbut i guarantee you they are farreaching
369	1	not only was peltier not involved in the aquash murder but one of the references you provided httpindigenouswomenforjusticeorg  links to a report on how the peltier support group cut loose any connection to graham back in 2005 very much two different matters

373	1	instead of saying no way like the republicans do democrats just kindly ignore us and say nice sound bites to try and placate us sick of it
374	1	i mean there is no chance in hell i would but hey it is not my call for everyone
375	1	my opinion is that this issue has been extremely contentious for many years now  understandably as there are so many individual viewpoints and strong beliefs emotions justifiable to each my answer is more complicated than i intend on expressing here  ill try to keep it clear and concise bottom line my opinion is that we need to listen more to kanaka respect those who do have close connections to mauna kea question crown lands and how theyre managed and remember that sacred doesnt mean the same thing to everyone let me also clarify that i am not anti science many choose to believe that if youre not 100 all for the tmt then you must be anti science i do not see it as such i do however see science in general slowly becoming akin to some strange religion cult in today is time furthering my opiniona lot of cultural practitioners kanaka have very deep ties to the mauna and it is sacred for them many have ancestors buried there many have amakua that reside there on top the mauna are hundreds of identified sacred sights and ahu and hundreds more that hired archeologists refuse to identify we have seen time and time again many cultural beliefs practices and customs lost in translation those cultural practices and beliefs are fundamental for many in opposition to the tmt in fact theyre a huge portion of the genealogical records  and more oft than not theyre completely overlooked and easily dismissed by folks who are passionate about the construction of the tmt much of that which is sacred to kanaka wasnt written and was handed down in oral traditions i think a lot of people have a hard time understanding what is sacred to kanaka because they cannot read all about it in a text book maybe they didnt grow up traditionally or with deeply sacred kanaka values and teachings from birth perhaps theyre disconnected from their own genealogy and the land i cannot say for certain but i do question the serious lack of compassion and reverence for the original inhabitants exerting their fundamental rights and challenging them in a court of law to me that in and of itself is an oxymoron should kanaka have to consistently challenge to assert their cultural practices and right in courts should protesting and protecting have to continue why is ≈çlelo not being honored in the courts after all this is still the kingdom of hawaii in many minds and hearts and a kingdom illegally overthrown and illegally occupied up to today another very complicated subject let is examine some of the common opinions that are often presented in favor the tmt some of which you mentioned in your original comment i will change the words a bit from what you wrote  the tmt can be constructed without harming any sacred sights without polluting and all while respecting the ƒÅina  the tmt is a great investment for future generations the tmt will boost our economy it will add more jobs hawaiian ancestors used stars for navigation etc we should build the tmt to do the same i find it personally important to stay balanced and neutral im willing to contemplate everything you wrote and attempt to compassionately understand your point of view from my perspective i do not completely agree but it is important to deeply explore these opinions and beliefs how can all of these varying opinions and beliefs come together in a way that best serves all involved in a way that best serves all future generations all relations every facet of what is culturally important and scientifically important all while honoring the ƒÅina is it possible i have read and heard these kinds of broad statements made often about the subject from people who assert they know better than kanaka about the culture and occasionally from kanaka who do support constructing the tmt  hawaiians dont even practice ancient traditional religions anymore  how can rocks be sacred how can water be sacred how can mist be sacred etc  hawaiians used stars for navigation king kamehameha would be proud to have the tmt constructed all of the sudden hawaiians care and want to protest they should be protesting the bombing of kahoolawe the bombing on pohakuloa the military the construction on other sacred sights and burial grounds etc all of which and more have been and continue to be protested  anyone against the tmt is antiscience they kanaka just want money out of this hawaiians are turning this and every environmental political issue into a hawaiian sovereignty issue again more things to deeply contemplate i am a firm believer that compassion and aloha are fundamental keys in addressing anything i think it is important to look at things from all angles so without offering too much of my personal opinion beliefs surrounding the tmt id encourage you and everyone to deeply explore others perspectives there have been a lot of community meetings and talk story about mauna kea and the tmt and more continue to be presented on all islands being involved in ones community grants enormous opportunity to join in these kinds of activities to use your voice and heart to express  here is an organization planning some upcoming events and although they are directly financed by donations from various organizations in support of the tmt i will be attending many of the events scheduled why shouldnt i it is a great opportunity presented for communities to gather and share various perspectives i have a lot to learn and i want to understand more deeply those that dont see things as i do httpwwwenvisionmaunakeaorg the common ground series of community hooponopono meetings is also valuable and available to watch on youtube here is the first video where lanakila mangauil speaks about culture 4316 httpsyoutubej5lv57efxk
376	1	interesting thank you i see them as ancestors too i guess im still uncertain of what you originally asked me
377	1	no i got really drunk on vacation once and now it says mandyampnbspsometimes mandalay bayampnbspeditoh come on now who could possibly downvote that classic use of a tired overused worn out joke sheesh some peopled
378	1	for my nooksack folks they have always belonged at nooksack and they will always belong at nooksack they are never leaving nooksack ever that is the predetermined outcome
379	1	indeed and at the worst possible time of year across a lot of bald prairie i wonder what will happen at the border
380	1	thanks for the link it was helpful let is hope the orangehole doesnt fuck with this
381	1	i think it is good to have more discussions in this sub it seems boring to just have articles all the time
382	1	1 yes the roots of disenrollment and membership can be found in colonialismturnedfederalism those are not indigenous norms and yes having created the monster that is disenrollment in the 1930s the fed cannot absolve itself from the situation the fed has a moral trust responsibility to help solve the problem it created
383	1	yeah a lot of people have been commenting on that everyone else was laughing maybe that is the next trend in white alist actoractress humor disrespecting some poc is culture and desecrating their holysacred sites i remember hearing years ago back in the early 90s when some native americans in southern california allowed an undergroundrave to be held on their land so of course some of the idiot partygoers tagged some of the native americans historic structures
384	1	thank you for all of these links most helpful indeed
385	1	thanks for the clarification i was wondering how the potato which i understand is native to south america was domesticated a thousand years or more earlier in north america
386	1	yes in my article we right about an intertribal human rights forum
387	1	thanks for the info see for me i would look at some of those and consider them ancestors who happened to be extraordinary sometimes with magic sometimes strength of body or mind but still ancestors and if they are calling for ethereal help they are asking from their ancestors the connection through blood is emphasised much like haloa they are still chamoru
388	1	the dedication at typing all the ha is is almost impressive
389	1	your dad being half native has nothing to do with the lies and treachery used routinely against natives that continues to this day crimes against indigenous communities has never stopped it just gets ignored now unless it turns into standing rock or so
390	1	good thing nobody in the history of fences has ever figured out a way around them
391	1	tribal cops are better to the public than nontribal cops seem to be yes that is my experience
392	1	hay i no let is drill a pipeline tunnel under it
393	1	thanks does it have any toxins is it required to prepare it in a laborious way like kalotaro to remove the toxins or just boiled and eaten
394	1	agreed ive got a modmail started that i have been meaning to finish hopefully tonight our usual winter break is gonna be the death of us haha
395	1	true though dapl is mentioned first in the document which is amazinghttpsseattlelegistarcomviewashxmfampid4837799ampguid36077527493d4d53a588817528e6f683it is also showing as in committee  i guess it is expected to pass next month per the article
396	1	excellent thank youthat pulls the string on that source now we just need to find out where he is getting his info from is that david archambault speaking chief looking horseif this can be sourced direct to kelcy warren et al and then they do in fact drill in defiance of the us government and native peoples  it could be interpreted by some as tantamount to an act of war by a corporationweve seen how many armed americans can show up to defend a rancher against the blm i figure a few more might show up to face off against a corporation
397	1	right there is some really good information in this video amidst the satire people on reddit defending the safety regulations are perhaps very misinformed astroturfing and maybe even simply parroting promoting a narrative they choose to personally believe in maybe these people actually believe that pipelines are safe a combination of them perhaps i cannot say for sure what i can say for sure about this video is that i have a lot of information presented to dig a bit deeper into state rules and regs etc considering it is from 2015 one might hope that the state legalities and absolute lack of oversight local government collusion have changed for the better with what is currently occurring something tells me it is only gotten worse ill look into the information presented in this video more over the next week
398	1	perhaps yes perhaps no tutu pele has a powerful consciousness of her own i do not ever personally dictate on her behalf what she might or might not choose to do
399	1	gt simply the fact that it was foundthat would be it where he found it is now likely gonna be undergoing an archaeological survey
400	1	as a marine corps veteran of two foreign wars i can tell you there is no where on earth you would rather be when stuff goes down than next to a marine corps base
401	1	it actually just hit my local news in massachusetts as well first time ive seen anything relating to the dapl on local news
402	1	blood quantum is a colonial force which was introduced to american indian peoples in the 1800s it became law in the 1930s it was introduced to identify indians in order to dispossess us of our lands it was legislated albeit under guise of reorganization in order to cause our assimilation
403	1	ayyy no need to be callin people out two comments in were all on the same team yeah
404	1	jeez why why does it always come down to violence for the sake of money rather than respecting the rights of indigenous people whove already been fucked in the land of their ancestors and where the pipeline poses a serious health risk to the people of standing rock bismarck was fearful of the pipeline so they decided that it is just fine to route it near standing rock
405	1	why
406	1	no worries troubles or as we say here aole pilikia
407	1	the greatest achievement in or amidst my career is having a family and living a clean and sober life for the last nearly 15 years the most important work ive ever done is disenrollment defensedefending and protecting approximately 600 tribal members from termination at the hands of their kin disenrollment is selftermination and i am proud to help stymy or stop it from happening further
408	1	that is the screwed up side to the reservation system this would fix that potentially it is handing over ownership and usage rights
409	1	thank you for your review of the movie all good points ill take into consideration when ready to watch the film in the future as ive not seen it yet i very much enjoy reading many people is perspectives it offers me much more to contemplate before during and after edit to add as i commented quickly and not as thoroughly as i might genealogy is of utmost importance this is a current and perhaps forever lesson im only beginning to wrap my mind around when in my studies
410	1	it is more of a who sucks less than who is better
411	1	i dont believe that revisonist stuff and aborigines arent closely related to black africans in the first place at all i only posted it because it documents the struggle of indigenous people
412	1	does that mean the coushatta tribal council and enrollment office has finally stopped its disenrollment insanity based on questionable blood quantum calculations
413	1	butcher the new name is fine old names just remind us of european invasions
414	1	i would they came in peace in service and willing to put their lives on the line i think they understand now
415	1	but they are enrolled in the fort sill and mescalero apache tribes  there are chiricahuas in san carlos as well  the chiricahua as a unified tribe are not federally recognized  i did research related to this for one of my law profs back in 06 as he was working on making a case for federal recognition for the chiricahua apache  think he got busy with other work though when he was appointed special rapporteur at the un and it never went anywhere while i was still in law school
416	1	that is what reminded me
417	1	again it was a law review article which i was asked to write by my alma mater at the university of arizona college of law specifically by my professor and mentor rob williams at his suggestion two years ago this month my colleague ryan dreveskracht and i wrote it
418	1	i think it said that once they he plane company heard where the vets were heading and why the price suddenly grew exponentially edit if you click the link in the page it will take to the full story but here is the relevant quotewhat happened is the plane charter company had initially quoted 50000 for the plane and apparently after they found out where they were taking our vets and for what purpose the price got jacked up to 160000
419	1	thank you very much every one of these details supports this as cut and dried from an indigenous perspective these details will help in my advocacy in support of this cause aho
420	1	here you go man ff to 1245 the tribal elders are stating it pretty clearly httpsyoutube2syui5w5hl4
421	1	there is written wichita in one of the yellow areas

423	1	true so no rush
424	1	ayy thanks for the support
425	1	i guess it is semantics but the idea of a demi god doesnt really exist for us very often it is just ancestors all the way down their strength comes from other ancestors
426	1	im mostly scottish and my family over there and in the us are totally nonreligious holding to the old ways going many generations back  i have seen my elderly grandparents openly mocking religion and organized government my mom is an immigrant from scotland to the us and read books on the clans to us as kids some of my scot cousins are bikers i learned that scot bikers motorcycles are very keen on druidicceltic ways and are often in clubsmade up of mutual clan descendants clan emblemscreststartans on leather jackets and all   the original the wicker man film not the nicholas cage shitpiece is a fine film exploring some aspects of scottish tribal living  httpwwwimdbcomtitlett0070917
427	1	to be honest i think this a kinda ploy earlier in the day he made an opinion that would allow 5 or 6 elected officials to run for additional termsso it is a way for the current chief who appoint hembree and who openly campaigned for him to run for a third term
428	1	gthistorians estimate that before the plague america is population was anywhere between 20 and 100 millionim curious if their was a major population boom going on at the time and possibly overshoot given that horticulture had been firmly established in the eastern woodlands by then it wouldnt be surprising if the people were heading for decline at the time obviously a much milder decline but maybe 10 or something i wonder if there is any good research on thisedit changed region to eastern woodlands
429	1	the tribes that rely on bia police contract with bia but not sure how the expense is covered i would assume the federal government subsidizes law enforcement for low income tribes but i could be wrong
430	1	they sound like a bunch of whiney little bitches must really suck to have the government go back on its word couldnt imagine what that must feel like
431	1	interesting mahalo for your manao again im also a bit curious as to your personal definition of hƒÅnai did you read this definition somewhere or was this information passed on to you what youve expressed regarding hƒÅnai is unique to me as well i myself am hƒÅnai not in the way youve set forth as defining im curious to know your personal perspective thanks for sharing
432	1	httpswwwwarpaths2peacepipescomimageschinookbabycradleflathead1jpg
433	1	you can ask him at ccmann at gmail dot com
434	1	yeah i researched the topic extensively last year when posting about thanksgiving at the height of the dapl protest i tried finding the scholarly source regarding mary todds overspending but im having trouble finding ones that dont cost money when i learned of it though i was amazed that this piece to the puzzle isnt more widely criticized then again people think that the emancipation proclamation was because lincoln thought slavery and racism was wrong
435	1	wow really that sounds pretty consistent with mary todd is whole deal i dont like her and i think she dragged lincoln into a lot of bad stuff in part due to her seances in the whitehouse which were not for the purpose of contacting peaceful ancestors but rather other entitiesthis whole issue with lincoln ties into the related issue where after the war the idle union armies were redirected to subdue savages by which they mean commit mass genocide against innocent people particularly including literally eviscerating and our mothers and their small children and molesting and committing unspeakable depravations against their frozen corpses and bragging about it afterwards to the cheers of crowds of settlers slavery is bad but what the depraved and vile union soldiers did to our families was infinitely worse than slavery
436	1	wow i had no idea thanks for informing us
437	1	many tribes are lobbying in support of the native american energy act these would free up decision and restrictions by the doi httpswwwcongressgovbill115thcongresshousebill210httpswwwindianzcomnews20171005housecommitteeapprovesnativeamericanasp
438	1	quite possible i was sent a business card along with the earrings musbtans designs and a phone number  no website or etsy shop listed so i was searching online and came across this article from 2014 httpsindiancountrymedianetworkcomeducationnativeamericanstudentsstudentspotlightvideobuddingjournalistkeenanstewart
439	1	check outdodem kanonhsa a centre for nonindigenous peoples to learn from indigenous leaders and elders it is at yonge and st clairthe native canadian center has a solid calendar online some events are open to the public first stories toronto organizes tours around toronto guided by indigenous peoples the toronto public library hosts events on the regular such as tours speaking engagements movie nights lectures etc the uni if alberta has a free online distance course on indigenous studies their syllabus  is posted on their sitesorta related encourage you to watch the colombian movie the embrace of the serpent there is a a few trailers on youtube the group laen that is their old name cant remember their new name is hosting a talk early next year arguing that refering to mestizos as hispanics is white supremacy you can find them on fbthe women is coordinating committee for a free wallmapu is a small but mighty group of mapuche women taking actions in toronto advocating for the liberation of wallmapu they are the only indigenous people from abya yala that i am aware of that have successfully organized and partnered with fn groups in toronto in leading actionsbtw have you heard of the ta√≠nos they have been revived via the mestizos in puerto rico over the past 50 years
440	1	im a member of the cherokee nation too i remember when i was little i had to get a blood test for my card so that is where my misconception of the nation needing a blood quantum requirement came from when natives ask my tribe i just say cherokee and leave it at that never been asked for specifics that is cool youve got a good idea youre bird clan though i still like to ask people which clan theyre from in hopes of finding theyre from ours lol my mom is side which is my native side is blue clan were the duffield is and the kingfisher is nanyehi nancy ward is husband who got killed in the creek wars who she avenged his death and became a beloved woman her husband was a kingfishercould you shoot me some good facebook pages where actual cherokee are and discussing things ive tried to find solid cherokee forums but so many of them seem like theyre filled with people that arent cherokee
441	1	to add to your comment it reallypisses me off to see so many people perceive canada to be full of a bunch of dogoodies  i dont consider people who condone the kidnapping indoctrination and neglect leading to the death of children to be dogooders what the hell
442	1	astonishing and strange i suppose if it was me id be a little easy on her given that she might be a tribal person from her homeland who is new to this region and simply does not understand the gravity of the situation talk to her gently and explain that citizenship issues are very serious and there is a very difficult long history involved here ask her to not continue claiming she is a citizen of your nation when that is simply not possible most likely at this point she will apologize and cease from this behavior but if she does not then at that point you could escalate the issue with management
443	1	httpswwweeocgoveeocpublicationsfedprocesscfmsomebody can probably explain it better than me but the way it was explained to me was that its an extremely bureaucratic and formal complaint its a way of going around your hr department who is looking out for the company not the employees from what i understand its very time consuming for the employer and just an overall headache when one is filed especially when its warranted which i believe yours would bei almost filed one at my last job when one of my coworkers tried to tell me that squaw is not a racial slur
444	1	good suggestion
445	1	chi miigwech for the detailed response i love everything you said about writing and i really appreciate how subversive this statement isgtget the pain out of your brain profit from your pain im so good at it now i welcome drama even if i face the most ignorant of people i think in scenes i think how should i write about thisit makes me think of soft techniques in martial arts  taking the energy someone throws at you and redirecting it to your advantagethat is an awesome list of authors and illustrators ive enjoyed some of these people is work aaron paquette is a big inspiration to me ill look into the names that are unfamiliar that gilbert shelton fellow has some wild work reminds me of a lot of the drag race the car kind not rupaul is lol art my uncles have

447	1	i will say this fuck zinke
448	1	thank you for mentioning them i was wondering if different tribes were pooling their money together
449	1	thanks that makes sense
450	1	exactly  prosperity is traditional  self sufficiency is traditional  poverty is a newer concept  our ancestors thrived they harnessed the tools around them to achieve success communally and personally  the good hunter of the past is the successful business owner of today indigenous communities must also concentrate upon small business and promoting the entrepreneurial spirit amongst their band members  the small business operator is the individual that portrays most accurately the analogy of the successful hunter of the pastif the indigenous communitys leadership refuses to help the entrepreneurs in their community then that would be akin to in the past if the band would not help their young men go out and hunt  it is hard to imagine a band that would not help their young people to go and hunt or would not take it upon themselves as a band to teach their young people how to hunt and provide for themselves learning to provide for oneself was a strong part of a vibrant cultureas writers illustrators and publishers we are all business owners and operators our business is words images and helping others achieve enlightenment and prosperity we are all hunters hunting for projects hunting for creative outlets hunting for influence hunting for clients
451	1	i live in north america probably same as you i have not been to south america since i left as a toddler and i am unfamiliar with my living relatives let alone my long dead ones it would be amazing if i could find out more about my ancestry but i simply cant research where i am now i guess it can read up about the history of my country and about andean prehistory that is a startalso i am simply saying how i personally identify your life may be very different than my own and thus is is natural for us to view ourselves differently i was raised in the culturally anglocelticgermanic usa and canada my parents who raised me and who i still live with are from urban medell√≠n and lived there their whole lives it was only my grandparents who lived in the countryside el campo o el monte in spanish as you say and i simply have almost no connection to them being from a spanish speaking south american family in north america made me identify with  and others identify me as  hispanic or latino culturally that is who i am i want to get more in touch with my native roots i really do but if i do it would be because of my own curiosity and not because it is my family tradition this is why i ask questions about authenticity and why i dont identify as aboriginal i am simply a mestizo who wishes to ally myself with true aboriginals so i can better understand them and learn about them  and by extent my ancestors this is also why i use the flair i chose
452	1	gtthe colonizercolonized relationship is one of peoples not individual peopleare americans during the indians wars colonists to american indian tribes
453	1	excellent points that underscore the strength of the legal case
454	1	saying that we colonists need to deoccupy your lands seems pretty explicit about what is owed
455	1	interesting there are others like me i thought i was just a weirdo though many latinos recognize their indigenous and mestizo origins it is generally considered something of the past and not something people really care about
456	1	hahahaa get the fuck outta ere
457	1	if they made it plural it could work
458	1	where did i say anything about the western hemisphere
459	1	they are so desperate for cheap workers its not even funny my dad was offered a mananger position in one of them the offered pay was so good that my parents could pay off all their debt and my dad could retire 10s earlier he didnt take it but youd think that the sorrounding towns would ban them unless the added revenue i really worth dealing with this but i doubt it edita word
460	1	ihs is history of abuse and substandard care combined with the difficulty of accessing affordable alternative care in the private sector is a serious problem do you think that making medicare available for all  in effect reducing its eligibility age to zero  would help alleviate the problem of accessing affordable quality healthcare  there still needs to be doctors and hospitals available where they are neededthe forced sterilization you mention has been welldocumented and i am not aware that anyone was held accountable for this  nor has it been covered at all in the mainstream media
461	1	if theyre settling in dakota land without permission and without assimilating into dakota society then yeah theyre citizens of the us and colonizers of dakota lands     in order to not be a colonizer of the dakota nation the family would first need permission from the dakota government to enter the territory visa and further permission to reside there immigration  furthermore they might then go through whatever process of naturalization set by the dakota nation in order to become citizens of the dakota nation  in that case they are no longer colonizers or immigrants theyre citizens    this is exactly the type of situation i was describing above  the implication is that just because the us could decide to deoccupy first nations lands i wont hold my breath it doesnt necessarily have to mean that the inhabitants of those territories would all have to leave  if those people would be willing to relinquish their american citizenship and live under the jurisdiction of the controlling nation and if that controlling nation deemed those people to be enough of a contribution to society then they very well might be allowed the opportunity to stay   this is all of course very hypothetical and incredibly farfetched considering the moral compass of murcia yet it is a useful exercise in decolonizing the mind
462	1	for real i dont give a damn about reparations  we need control of our lands and natural resources  our people are dying  our communities are suffering  the reason being that our lands and resources are being exploited for the benefit of the occupiers not us
463	1	aole pilikia
464	1	gtanother issue is that the taxes were needed to pay for the indian wars as in killing indians so then they dress as indians to protest taxes they had to pay for the service from the government of engaging in genocide against indianswasnt it that the british didnt want to expand the colonies due to their treaties with most of the tribes bordering the colonies and the colonists wanted to expand regardless
465	1	so mods should probably delete this
466	1	my guess is japan either didnt want to encourage or it didnt have enough speakers they couldnt have used okinawan because there are thousands of japaneseamericans in the us who spoke it and other languages in japan ainu amamian etc either barely had or any speakers or the japanese government was in the process of banningdiscouraging them

501	1	the unfortunate aspects that exist within tribal governments that you take note of here often stem from two main problems implementation of culturally inappropriate forms of government and paternalism while it doesnt work out in all cases many tribes have set great examples of what happens when they adopt a more traditional and or culturally relevant form of government for their people and when they are allowed to administer services and programs through the exercising of self governance  they become economically sustainable their standard of living improves and they generate socioeconomic benefits to surrounding nonnative communities a great book that provides these examples is rebuilding native nations by miriam jorgensen
502	1	ok
503	1	yes but it doesnt matter if america is made up of immigrants  like your dutch immigrant scenario the relationship of immigrants to america needs to be evaluated separately from the colonizercolonized relationship   reparations are due from the colonizing nation to the colonized nation  it doesnt have to do with individual people at all  the citizens of the colonizer whether he be a descendant of andrew jackson himself a guy who naturalized yesterday or a newborn baby are all responsible for making the reparations as a whole as a nation not individually  those reparations are made to the colonized nation as a whole   it doesnt matter whos descended from whom or whether they immigrated or not  as citizens of the offending nation they comprise the beneficiaries of the horrors that occurred  the same is true for the colonized

518	1	gt make all of them direct beneficiaries of the massacre geonocide rape and pillaging of all native peoples of the americas this is true of all american citizens who were granted their citizenship either through sanction by the us government or inherited through their us citizen parentsnow youre getting itgtand you know what nearly seven belgiums fit into the confines of washington stateand did you knowthat the concept of graffiti is older than the word vandalismgtq what makes the nation of belgium a country and the native nations like the sioux mere tribesgta a colonized mind which has fallen for the racist falsehoods whose origins lie in white supremacy their civilizations are no more valid than ours area part 2 depending on the style of governance culture within a group organization of that group and centralization of leadership there was a til about a year ago that the aztecs werent really an empire but were actually allied tribes grouping together for defense now empire is subjective especially across the atlanticpacific but saying the aztecs were a couple tribes that banded together would be like saying rome was just a citystate at one point thatd actually be accurate but it is not after a certain and important point in their historywhen we look at all indigenous groups within the usa as the exact same thing including governing styles we kinda sorta really ignore the differences between them and what makes them special the pamunkey had their paramountcy the iroquois had their confederacy and the spuyal…ôpab≈° had semiautonomous villages that overwhelmingly preferred doing whatever in the hell they wanted and the leaders of such villages usually represented that village only and if you let the position of leaderchiefwhatever get to your head and you get pushy and start trying to enforce your will theyll kill you oddly enough it is the same across washington state which in a somewhat long snarky overly explaining about the differences in the indians within that particular area comment that i scrapped i said was used solely because im the most familiar with it
519	1	the article is basically arguing that laws that treat native americans and tribal members differently eg tribal sovereignty or adoption rights are racist the argument is one of assimilation akin to the arguments made in the late nineteenth century
520	1	right i am fed up at times with those who assume canada is like a paradise news flash a lot of canadians are pretty racist
521	1	protesting is a visual demonstration that manifests physical intent to do something one of the biggest issues for native communities is that were arent seen in the first place you are right that we need lawyers and that many of our battles take place in the courts that is just one of many battlefieldshowever the nonnative people of the public do not see that they are content on believing what they always do for the most part out of site out of mind if a battle is one in court and a big change takes places that affects nonnatives they could likely have the same reaction to that as if it were a protest that is the case in washington state where every other year the nonnative fishermen start clamoring for the abrogation of treatieswhile an action like blocking a highway might annoy those not involved with the protesters what it does is display a public outrage that wouldnt otherwise be noticed by those who are used to having natives pushed into the corner and told to be silentsometimes situations call for direct action such as protesting the idea is to keep them peaceful but to have an immediate impact to cause a change not every situation needs direct action some do and if a few people get annoyed about it that is something were gonna have to bite the bullet on people will be annoyed no matter what route we take
522	1	im bored too and actually i enjoy talking with you   our occupied country engages in legal battles and other civil actions as well  they do their best to drain the shit out of us  my husbands family just won a legal land case that stretched on for twenty years  it was a family vs a large corporation  they meant to either bleed us dry or wait until the grandparents died  justice won in the end but really twenty years  thats bullshit  i take it back its not justice  its just plain bullshit

531	1	talk to the official cherokee genealogists you can find them on facebookyoure thinking that at some point records began and were disrupted by us being pushed off our land and moved around but in truth records began because of all the treaties forcing us to give up land the main ones of course are the dawes and baker rolls but that is not all im not a genealogist so i couldnt tell you every list and record but people like david cornsilk could it is not really something that is written down as a whole you just have to talk to cherokee experts theyre mostly on facebook if theyre online at all i was including all the sideways connections so im talking about people who would be extremely distantly related one of my ancestors lacey christie had i think ten children and all his kids had a ton of kids there are several thousand christie descendants now looking at my other ancestors is pretty similar so i dont see why it is so unbelievableoh and there werent actually a whole bunch of cherokee left along the trail of tears or anything that is mostly a myth the vast majority of people who cant prove cherokee heritage simply arent cherokee

542	1	here is a maui magazine editorialhttpsmauimagazinenethawaiianhanai that touches on the practice of hanaihanai is a practice that my ohana continues to practice today  the main difference between hanai and western adoption is that hanai is not the giving away of a child to someone else  it is the sharing of a child  i have never heard of it being done outside of a blood family  unlike western adoption children are always aware of who their biological parents are and so long as it is possible keep in contact with share a bond with and interact with their biological parents as a family in addition to and even at the same time as they do with their hanai parents  of course this is not possible in some cases for example death maybe living far away from each other or some other thing may make it impossibletwo of my cousins were hanaied with my grandparents  it didnt mean they changed who their parents were  it meant that they now had two moms and two dads however we were still referred to as cousins  they lived for the most part with my grandparents and they were primarily responsible for raising them choosing school paying for everyday expenses however as a family we were constantly interacting and meeting with each other and the overall family dynamic remained the same  when they got older they were given the option to remain with our grandparents or come back to their parents  they chose to stay  that was probably due to both resentment of their real parents and love of their hanai parents together to be honest  i myself was hanaied with my paternal grandmother but only until i was around 5ish since she became too sick  it broke my heart to leave and i was resentful of going back to my parents who gave me away in my eyes  as an adult i can see how my hanai upbringing has benefited me over my other siblings who never left our parents  i gained a different exposure and was nurtured in a different way than they were and it made a huge difference in my development as a person  my family wants to hanai my youngest son right now  thing is i have my foot half in and half out  i havent committed yet and hes 8 months already  problem is two families are fighting over him they really want him bad  since i have other kids i understand this through hanai to family members in a higher position than myself currently he will have access to more than i can currently provide both in lifestyle and in personal attention  havent been able to commit to it though so since he was born hes been passed along between our three families  rotated like a sick game of passtheparcel  i see him maybe 34 days a week and the rest of his time is split  honestly he is developing in an extraordinary manner  hes 8 months and speaking already and hes about a minute away from walking  he is a social child and is very emotionally balanced  i know i can attribute those things to having a ton of attention devoted especially to him  much more than i can provide honestly  still i remain half in and half out

546	1	which i would also agree with as outlined so generously by john marshall the us in their minds inherited the supposed possessions of great britain through the signing of the treaty of paris through this transitive action the current occupying colonial nations would be responsible for what they inherited from their former colonial parent nationseither way that is a much easier argument to make than trying to also go after the european nations that no longer have as big of a stake in the americas though the extremely ambitious of us shouldnt be stopped if theyd want to try i suppose
547	1	it doesnt matter how many nations lie within the borders of washington state  washington state is a construct of the united states  estonia denmark switzerland taiwan and rwanda could all fit into washington state as well with room to spare  not relevant  gt did the dakota see themselves as one nationi dont know  i was going off of the hypothetical situation you proposed    but even if they didnt in the past even if they dont now there is no reason why upon restoration of independence they could not choose to create a confederation or a union in order to function as a whole if they decided it was beneficial to do so  the same goes for all the citystate territories you mentioned  that is what it means to be selfdetermining as a nation  the single thing impeding any of us from doing this presently is because the us directly impedes it  our hypothetical discussions regard deoccupation and restoration of autonomy though so these limits dont exist

551	1	thanks uguatki for providing the additional background about the protest march event  it sounds like it was a good gathering that wasnt accurately portrayed by the media   yah i kinda winced inside when i read the caption of the person being attributed as a medicine man  and then i thought well i dont know who that person is amp maybe he could be  the way we say it is that a person is like a medicine manwoman and theyre known by others to be like one  the way i know amp was taught is that the person would never call themselves one or have a picture taken saying they were one  amp if someone selfproclaims to be one you should beware of them  this is something that should not be talked about in public news outlet like this  so i thought that picture caption is not how i know it should be  im wyoui didnt like the title either  also i would add another item to the list  didnt trump amp his lackey bia appointee add more red tape bureaucracy to make it harder for all tribes to put land into trust and add a new stipulation that the trust land has to be within commute distance whatever that means  i seem to recall something like thati noticed that the author appears to be of east indian descent  nothing against her per sebut the thought occurred to me that wicmn shutting down it would be real helpfulnice for online news outlets like buzzfeed to freelance hire one of the recent outofwork regular ndn contributorsauthors from icmn when it comes to writing about native topics  im sure they could use the money amp additional exposure
552	1	you can do lots of research online try google scholar andor if your public library has access to an academe search engine like jstor you can find lots of research studies in english and in spanish you can also find lots of stuff in spanish on youtube too dont get too discourage because of the distance there is no lack of scholarly studies online start with a wide search and then just narrow down your key words as you go through your literature review one thing that helped me was reading up on my country is independence movements from spain and gran colombia as it was the beginnings of state discussions around national identity and the different cultural and racial groupsif your intention is to learn from indigenous peoples while learning about your ancestors i would perhaps start by learning about colombia is history precolumbian history of abya yala and maybe just talking to your family and colombian friends you can see if any colombian university with an anthroplogy or native studies dept has a fb group too also look up current indigenous groups in colombia and see what they have to say about mestizos i found many active fb groups during my research indigenous peoples in my country tend to build class coalitions hence why some of them are very close to the campesinos and consider them brotherssistersin the city i live there are some latino orgs that are building relationships with indigenous peoples based on shared histories and cultures i have met a few latinosmestizos in the last few years who like you are also trying to reconnect with their indigenous roots last but not least think of meaningful ways that you can give back in exchange for the knowledge and insights that indigenous peoples share with you especially if you become engaged with a group that welcomes you in their spaces   buena suerte

555	1	thank you for your insight i think you will find most of mesoamerica and the andes to be quite interesting since the natives are still the dominant population precolumbian culture is alive and well they can never kill us all off however unlike mexicans peruvian guaran√≠ etc a lot less of the original culture of what became colombia was passed down to me obviously the language and religion are gone most of what survived were food certain slang words a few customs and traditions and other miscellaneous stuff the indigenous peoples greatest contribution to modern colombian society was deep culturehttpswwwohiseecomblogwpcontentuploads201309culturaliceberg2jpg since it very hard to forcibly change or gentrifyi want to rebel against the colonizer is assimilation of my distant grandmothers but they made it hard since the muiscachibcha people were weaker than the azteca or incas and were assimilated to a greater extent there are people willing to get in touch with their native roots but i cant help but feel there are issues of authenticity since most of us are hundreds of years removed from when our ancient grandmothers became hispanized this is why i am not confortable in identifying as indigenous i only identify as mestizo since that is what i know for sure that i am however to be closer to the original culture of the land of my birth is my goal to express my mestizo identity perhaps any metis that browse this sub can help me shed light on how to express my mixed identity in a respectful way
556	1	hmm i never thought about it that way i must carry the torch of my ancestors then i cannot let the conquerors control my life from beyond the grave i cant let them win im not sure where to start though perhaps i can tell people to stop calling someone uneducated if they use the native version of a word rather than the official spanish word i might also learn to read those complex numeralshttpsuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb33dnumeracion_muiscajpg300pxnumeracion_muiscajpgalso im a bit unlike the 116 cherokee people a lot of them claim that their greatgreatgrandma whom theyve never met was cherokee  but the rest of their family is white i on the other hand call myself mestizo because my parents are mestizo my grandparents were mestizo their parents were etc up until the 15001600s
557	1	yes the journalist could have done better to say traditional dancer rather than presume a lot the dancer is phil little thunder he is lakota from rosebud and is involved in all of this from the beginning he didnt use that term to describe himself to anyone i would not be surprised if others think of him that way though what we had that day wasnt exposition dancing for tourists it was something more powerful medicine so
558	1	definitely no problem with calling out the posts in the actual threads  i am glad you are willing to do it and would encourage you to continue if you desirepart of the reason weve opted to remove them is that even though keeping them up might be informative to others we risk giving those websites more publicity if the link to the site remains active but someone suggested to use out automoderator to blacklist these fraudulent websites which i believe is something we will do this would be ideal since it will help us to prevent associating with those sites and informs the op that the site isnt approved of herepart of our internal conduct for the mod team though is that we try to leave removal notices for commentsposts in order to keep that history from vanishing as you mentioned it is also for transparency so either way a mod comment should be left if something is removed provided leaving said comment doesnt do more harm than good

564	1	posting history also demonstrates feigned ignorance and innocenceit is not fooling anyone
565	1	look at it this way  imagine britain did end up making reparations to india  those reparations are coming from the citizenry of britain as a whole  if a british citizen migrated to and becomes a citizen of india then he changes from being an payer of reparations to a beneficiary of those same reparations  of course he never had paid anything directly as a british citizen but neither does he receive anything personally as an indian citizen beneficiarythe relationship is nation to nation  does that make sense
566	1	absolutely  just finished a huge book tour through montana wyoming colorado new mexico arizona california oregon and washington  set up at indigenous comic con in albuquerque and presented at a number of universities and schools  send me an invite and ill make it happen
567	1	i sort of float around a lot of minority subs just to stay educated and gain insight im black myself and my people definitely face a lot of problems and have faced a long history of incredible injustices also i dont like to rank how bad one minority has it over others because it is difficult to put that kind of thing into perspectivethat being sad the injustices against native peoples is just straight up unbelievable at least there is a constant dialogue around african americans the way history straight up ignores or makes fun of or even romaticizes the mass rape pillaging and genocide of the indigenous population is astounding they do not give a fuck like at all if you say the nword you will at least face some social backlash but if you want to make fun of american indians  go for it it is an incredibly sobering thing to experience and again i say that as a black man in america
568	1	not really share techniques but people will be friends and chill back each other up or just shake hands and respect each other  unless they train then they sharei didnt mind it when i was young but by high school i was done with it it starts at maybe three or four teaching how to punch and touch sparring also just wrestling with other kids sparring was with pecha hits i dont know the english word it is like fingers straight out and you hit like that also slap boxing if you are really sparring at that age it is usually no face no balls unless you have glovesmiddle school is when i was taught to grip a lighter to make the punch more solid and where to kick to hurt or drop a guy to his knees middle school is when people start to know who is an actual badass and those guys go after each other a lot but you know most of the time it is just crazy kids fighting like animals loli had a friend who is from canada and he said the reason he went back there was because things kept escalating more real fights with crazy people lol you can just go on youtube and search guam fight and see a bunch of stuff mostly kids
569	1	this was a tunnelthere is a photo identity of him but no known nor confirmed shots of this guyi picked the only known royalty free photo of what is the known photo of himshortfall on my part for not calling it that
570	1	well it is really mostly a legal distinction that the canadian government makesin 1867httpthecanadianencyclopediacaenarticlebritishnorthamericaact1867document an enumeration of federal powers was declared including power of indians it is hereby declared that  the exclusive legislative authority of the parliament of canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated that is to say 24 indians and lands reserved for the indiansat the time it was generally understood by said government that the inuit was not part of this category but legally they were regular canadian citizens then in 1939 there was a canadian supreme court case that ruled that inuit should be part of this category so you start getting the phrase indian and inuit to make clear both are included in things then later there is the shift to the term first nations at which point we start seeing the term first nations and inuit and then first nations inuit and metis which is a legal synonym for aboriginal in canadaso this simplifies or changes perhaps the question to why did the canadian government and people consider the inuit to not be indiansfirst nations people from 1867 to 1939well partially because of laws and court decisions first one should realize that court cases at the time referred to inuit as eskimos as we know yupik eskimos are a different people is group and it is generally insulting now to misidentify inuit as eskimo however actual yupik eskimos are fine with the term and self identify with it as do some inuit that live in alaska but definitely not inuit that live in canada in any case when reading older canadian court decisions and you see the word eskimo it actually means inuithere is an excerpt of the indian actgt canadian indian act section 41 41 a reference in this act to an indian does not include any person of the race of aborigines commonly referred to as inuitso that settles it right not so fast the courts arent in agreement with the lawgt duff cj plurality decision eskimos must be considered indians because the official documents at the time referred to eskimos as savages which was how indians were referred to at that timegt cannon j crocket j concurring the eskimo are indians because the french word sauvages english for savages includes all present and future aborigines native subjects of the proposed confederation of british north americagt kerwin j cannon j and crocket jj concurring another plurality decision the common definition of indian at confederation equated eskimos with indians and therefore eskimos must be indiansso there we have it according to great learned white men indians and eskimos are one and the same because factually both are savages that is the actual legal reasoningregarding m√©tis there is also this casegt r v blais  2003 3 scr 237 facts the appellant was charged for hunting without a license at trial the appellant argued that he was exercising an aboriginal in this case m√©tis right which was protected under the natural resource transfer agreement  the respondent crown argued that the natural resource transfer agreement does not apply to the appellant since the term indian does not refer to the m√©tisso what do inuit say usually im not indian im inuk but their voice and perspective is not consulted or considered in these important white legal matters
571	1	i dont see why he wouldnt he is definately a good change from pope john paul ii
572	1	i should have been more clear in general i was of the understanding that most natime american traditions from a historical standpoint coincided peacefully in terms of religion i was trying to see if there was a theological reason for that amongst any nations represented by users on this subreddit
573	1	this is exactly what an elder warned against when he lectured the entire powwow before doing the opening prayer a few years back
574	1	thanks to you and ugelatin_biafra for bringing this to our attention while the matter is being discussed among the mod team for a consensusbased decision ive decided to halt the posting from this website for the time being and have removed this post
575	1	well it sure didnt seem to work the majority of tribes sided with the uk in the american revolution
576	1	talk about scummy people will hafto double check my sources before i go posting them thanks for the info
577	1	were talking about nations and nationality here not about race or ethnicity  many of our nations were multiethnic  the kingdom of hawaii accepted citizens based on allegiance to our country and laws irrespective of race or heritage  the reason why we cannot expand our civilization by allowing immigrants to naturalize presently is because the us government shackles us with the racist oppression of blood quantum  the person who is the colonizer is the person who attempts to impose a foreign society upon a people in their own land  people who immigrate into foreign society and assimilate into that society are not colonizers
578	1	great greaser bob im so glad youve come back even if briefly after that last post i tried to help that dude with his language issue spending a lot of time on it and there was no response from him as youd pretty much predicted in your own response which the mods imo unreasonably criticizedanyway glad youre getting along and still around if only for a moment
579	1	i also pondered the same thing about using the rebuttals here as a way to combat problematic posts like this often enough we encourage that in this case however i opted to remove it because many of our visitors are lurkers my immediate thought was that some might take the hosting of this article as an endorsement of its content if they did not read the comments i feel that locking it could pose the same issue preventing those strong arguments from being presentedbut i am not against such a thing the idea was actually mentioned in our modmail discussion to make a rebuttal post to this no wonder if it will be a done deal yet or not still i appreciate your thoughts on the matter
580	1	how do you know what her blood quantum is are full blooded indians who grow up in cities not actually native how do you know she didnt grow up with the culture and how do you know what role she playsnin the struggle how do you when she does or doesnt claim identity
581	1	to me being an ndn transcends just about everything in this life including the us dominant societys national politics that have been superimposed upon our tribal nations  internally in our tribal elections we have never had democratic or republican parties amp candidates  to me it doesnt matter what political party a person is this issue is about protecting our essence of what it means that we were born as a native person into this life                 what if donald trump had claimed in the past to be native americanamerican indian solely because that is the family myth that his parentsgrandparents told him  the same set of circumstancesactions like warren amp her family with no interactionparticipation with the native community amp worked was outside of ndn world  what if trump like warren didnt do any family research and when genealogists from the tribe he falsely claimed to be of went out of their way to meet whim twice to discuss he refused amp ignored them  and instead of being honest and acknowledging the situation using it as an opportunity to inform the dominant society not to make the same mistake of personally falsely claiming to have ndn blood by relying on family myths he responded just like warren  by saying attacks on my family wont shut me up   do you believe that would be righti feel the need to add that im not a fan of trump except for pulling out of tpp which bernie sanders first supported doing i cant think of anything else that trump has done as president that i agree with and i cant imagine that he will do anything that would be specifically in the best interests of our tribal nations  as ive said on the forum several times i believe he is wrong for calling warren pocahontas
582	1	i believe it is a joke a portmanteau of indigenous and indignant
583	1	this is great evidence thank you
584	1	gti dont give a damn about reparationsneither do i but im bored and willing to talk about it for a little bitgtthe reason being that our lands and resources are being exploited for the benefit of the occupiers not usanother comment on a different was a canadian redditor wondering what is with all the fighting and why nobody seems to utilize legal battles instead of protests well my tribe does both as do quite a few other tribes in my area in washington state which was gonna be named columbia to avoid confusion with washington dc and used to have idaho and oregon as a part of it when it was still a territory and the progress is generally some victories some of the time a few good lawyers and funds is not enough to usher change on such a scale public outcry against abuses works for a bit then it dissipates until people go oh yeah that happened when you try to remind them
585	1	just to get it a bit more clear im talking specifically about american colonization of indian territory which quite a few t shirts emphasize is in fact the entirety of the continental united states and that unlike the british spanish or whichever colonial powers diced up their slice of the new world americans are overwhelmingly made up of immigrants which ties into the obama quote from earlier to either the nation or colonies founded by other nations and acquired by the united states this makes me wonder in the hypothetical reparations as to which nation pays which groups the clearest is that the usa in general would pay reparations to all groups but after that it starts to get a little muddled
586	1	thank you for the response i was wondering if they had any intention of using this as a sort of false flag as well it is distinct dress and from afar it could be confusing
587	1	youre under surveillance just for saying that
588	1	gt set up at indigenous comic con in albuquerqueyou made ityay there seems to be such a growing network of native american comics and illustrators q do you foresee an indigenous comic con in canada
589	1	wow thank you for the information
590	1	have you considered that spirituality cultural practices religion etc are perhaps topics that are not openly discussed with strangers check out this map and make sure to zoom in to see even more it is a fantastic visual as to the many many tribes nations and bands of north america keep in mind that many are not federally recognized and may not be listed as well also keep in mind this website was developed by a nonindigenous individual heres an excerpt from the blog i wanted to make something to reach out to nonindigenous people like myself something that would engage them in with indigenous history in a friendly and interesting way indigenous people already know their territory  its the settlers who needed to have a look at the information i was collecting i wanted people to have indigenous names and lands in mind as they went about their days httpsnativelandcathere are 566 different federally recognized tribes in the us and 630 different first nations in canada on a side note from what ive read in the blog there its a continuing work in progress and the developer is open to receiving any input from native americans and indigenous people is to add to or update on the website httpsnativelandcaabouthttpsnativelandcabuildingnativelandcahttpsnativelandcaaquestionofbordershopefully this puts into perspective that asking a vague and generalized question in this subreddit is not always the best way to encourage community involvement edit to fix spelling
591	1	dont you see though how broad you are targeting and not specifici could ask i am trying to understand the view of afroeurasian religionsspiritual traditions on other faiths are african asian and european religionspiritual traditions all a single unified monolithic group with so much in common that they can be addressed as one and compared to something outside that group
592	1	yeah there are many of us weirdos out there he he met this chilean guy who wrote a whole zine about his identity as a mestizo his life in canada and his struggles being multiracial with indigenous roots it is not avail online but you can probably find him online and ask to mail you a copy he is selling it for like 5 or 10 bux let me know if youre interested the dia de los muertos committee in toronto planned an event last month and invited a first nations group as special guests and even involved them in the planning committee as a way of building bridges between mexicans in canada and indigenous peoples in toronto that is just one exemple there have been other connections recently as well with other groups
593	1	i didnt know that that is awesome ill have to watch that movie again with my dad soon that all really is too bad fargo is one of my favorite movies and i liked him in that know by chance what took him
594	1	gt i understand you wont find mexican indigenous populations but im under the impression that peru has a large indigenous population which will probably have a lot more insightactually both have millions of nonmestizo indigenous peoples according to mexico is commission on indigenous people and the census there are 25 million people who identified as indigenous and live in a household where at least 1 adult member can speak an indigenous language this comes to around 15 of the mexican population fitting this description however it is important to note that in these countries there is no hard line between indigenous and nonindigenous given the centuries of unrestricted intermarriage not to say a distinction doesnt exist almost everyone is on a continuum both a cultural one and a phenotype one not just mexico i would say this applies to most of latin america except the parts of the southern cone because of this you can have people who dont look white at all and live in a heavy indigenous area but dont qualify as indigenous because they never learned the language at home i imagine that if the us and canada used the mexican definition of indigenous the number would be a lot less than what it currently is that is not to say however that there arent mexicans who lean more to the european side of the spectrumeven with the usa a lot of latino immigrants arent latino at all and speak indigenous languagesgt i would suggest looking into whether those things were given by the indigenous or were just taken by othersthis is the really tricky part there is no clear answer to this let me explain what i mean when england and france set up colonies in north america they were largely insular communities that slowly grew on top of the ashes of the previous nations  they didnt absorb into them spain on the other hand had a different policy they still completely wiped out many groups largely hunter gatherers in lowdensity areas such as the southern cone or the caribbean may their souls rest in peace but mesoamerica and the andes were different the population densities were very high even post plague and the people they encountered were often organized into powerful state and empire organizations with formidable armies and some of the largest cities amp monuments the spanish have ever seen they could not be wiped out and even today indigenous people are still a majority or plurality of the population thus their strategies for these areas was to take over preexisting countries and institutions rather than building over them mexico is technically the successor state to the aztecmexica empire they kept the same capital name and a lot of the churches and buildings they used in the capital were converted aztec temples and buildings the spanish intermarried into the native nobility to solidify their rule the spanish peasantworking class colonizers did the same they were overwhelmingly men with local native women during these intermarriages not always voluntary assimilation into spanish religion and culture was obviously part of the deal these mixedraced children grew up more through their dad is culture than their mother is  since dad was backed by the state  but their mother is culture still got passed down to the children so i guess to answer your question the culture was given not takenkind of these mestizos eventually became majorities throughout spain is colonies and their wars of independence were often framed as mestizo vs european the national identity of these new countries was based on the ideology of mestizaje where indigenous and spanish were combined into a new culture often times forcefully for example mexico is flag shows a scene from a famous aztec legend day of the dead is a superficially christianized celebration of the mexica celebration of ancestors the virgin of guadeloupe the principle sacred icon for mexicans is an apparition to a native person and juarez one of their most treasured presidents was indigenous by culture and identity in a sense just like how in the us immigrants assimilate to an englishbased culture so too do all mexicans assimilate into this mestizaje identity regardless of their ancestry so then this is where the question of appropriation comes inthat is just mexico though other countries have different stories uruguay and paraguay exist in the same area and are possibly named after the same rivertribe but their shared histories end there in uruguay all natives were killed off or driven away uruguay is the whitest country in all of the americas 95 a lot more than usa or canada paraguay on the other hand had forced intermarriage and assimilation it was required by law that all spanish marry native and all native marry spanish with the goal of making a homogeneous population though i dont support forced assimilation because of this policy almost everyone in paraguay is bilingual in both guarani and spanishhttpswwwwikiwandcomenlanguages_of_paraguay coofficial languages  the highest  of indigenous language speakers in the americashttpwwwnytimescom20120312worldamericasinparaguayindigenouslanguagewithuniquestayingpowerhtml  and just like the nickname for mexicans are the aztecs the people from paraguay are called guarani in spanish
595	1	real talk though  in my ohana hanai is the ultimate display of love  its a display of love to the hanai parents because it proves absolute trust and there is no higher honor because selecting hanai parents means that you trust them with your most prized and loved possession your  very own child  its a display of love to the child that says i love you so much that i am willing to suffer in the absence of you so that you may have the best chances the best resources the best connections the best education the best quality of life i can possibly give to you  and all the while i still get to love you like youre my own because you still are even after all this thats what hanai is to me  its the ultimate act of love
596	1	gt people who immigrate into foreign society and assimilate into that society are not colonizerswhy not
597	1	dont mention it
598	1	thanks for finding the original source of the story
599	1	colonizer noungt1 a person who helps take control of an area or a country that is not their own especially using force and sending people from their own country to live there     persons who assimilate into a foreign society with permission not through force arent colonizers  theyre immigrants    immigration is a method by which civilization may expand rather than collapse and decay  food for thought  edit formatting

615	1	an interesting reply i agree with a some what youve expressed you stated  restore mauna kea clean mauna kea respect mauna kea consult with and respect the input of the true protectors of mauna kea the children of mauna keamany questions arise as they have for many generations here in hawaii nei the kupuna  elders of today have a lot to share regarding ideas for the restoration of mauna kea stewardship of mauna kea and even stories of their struggles to prevent such desecration on the mauna these stories come far before video recording cameras and social media existed so many are left not hearing knowing understanding their perspectives in my opinion now is the time to really listen to kupuna and ask them to get involved in any way possible if theyre willing to speak and participate thats the key  not sure if youve seen this yet i posted it back awhile ago informative and offering various perspectives thirty minutes in length  ªƒÅha ªi  ª≈çlelo ola mauna momentum with english subtitleshttpsoiwitvaooaooep1pt1maunakeaengsubthe university of hawaii has an interesting history yeah  history of uh presidents https1gyy0p31bywk3kl09732jggrwpenginenetdnasslcomwpcontentuploadslegacyweblinksuniversityofhawaiihistoryofuhpresidentspdf uh historyhttpwwwhawaiieduaboutuhhistoryperhaps it could be said that nearly all educational institutions introduced to some might even say forced upon the illegally overthrown kingdom of hawaii have forms of roots that should be explored more in depth from these roots we see multiple tree trunks and branches that spread out some displaying various constructs of corruptions overlapping with almost every form of industry and supposed innovations that arrived with the missionaries and the provisional government of hawaii  you may enjoy this video from an amazing kanaka maoli professor at uh kaleikoa kaeo audio warning the beginning oli chant is a bit powerful its a short video at less than twelve minutes long it serves as a reminder and for much needed inspiration that in todays times we are seeing so many amazing individuals entering into the university system as educators httpsyoutubedackyrvkv0 if a bit more time is available for you to explore another video i highly recommend hearing voices by dr ron williams jr director of lƒÅhui hawaii research center amp native hawaiian student services at uh this video is almost and hour and a half in length his personal history is quite interesting as a settler it delves quite deep into a few subjects introduced education in hawaii hawaiian newspapers missionary arrival outlawing use of language instituting foreign systems of such school structures and all that comes along with illegal occupation httpsyoutube2ebccudhdiwedit to add
616	1	i agree fully not enough is being done to address indigenous health issueshowever i feel i should comment that ihs is not the only source of health care for natives here ihs has a long history of abuse and substandard care thus many natives find sources of health care other than ihs with prisoners in the federal prison system as mentioned their cost of health care is their total cost and is a pretty concrete solid average not so with natives for whom ihs is only one source of many across the population thus the statistics given are almost certainly misleading and deceptive to be clear this is not to say that enough is being spent it is just pointing out that the way the statistics are presented is misrepresentative also ihs has a long history of extreme abuses against us as one example the long history of ihs performing forced nonconsensual sterilizations of native women who came in for other procedures ihs has a criminal history similar to the medical care provided by gestapo era germany to jewish patients this is not an exaggeration at all forcible nonconsensual sterilization of an ethnic group is not a joke it is not only a war crime it is a geneva convention defined instance of actual genocide a genocidal organization that provides harm and not care will hopefully not be the only source of care for our people
617	1	ohh i see i see  very interesting  mahalo for sharing with me

620	1	anytime just need a basic story line to build from sometimes its best to start with a children is book less to write and more focused for children is books 12 scenes is a good starting point  decide on a story to tell break it down into 12 scenes
621	1	yknow i just want to say that i really enjoyed this conversation between you and uzugwat it was fun to read and im glad to see these kinds of conversations taking place on rindiancountry that isnt to say they dont take place but i just appreciate it every timewe might have a need coming up in the near future to write something in our faq about decolonizing from what ive read in this thread you seem to be up on things  would you mind contributing to the writing if we reached out to you later about it

624	1	ahhh yes the report button never thought to use it for its intended purpose
625	1	i guess maybe it is all the useless protesting weve done this whole time i can think of a few cases locally like how these locals go and protest on the main highway why all your doing is making these people annoyed with us your not getting on the good side and building goodwill for your support and cause
626	1	havent heard of them but i thrive on collaborations id be happy to connect and work together in addition to my monthly napi series and publishing other authors works uneducation vol 2 is the next major release
627	1	south west washington i believe yeah so guam is different lol we still have cockfighting and stuff too so here its like weak people need to fight until people stop messing with them normal people fight so they arent thought of as weak and strong people fight for the challenge because it is funmany times people will fightspar 2 or 3 times over the course of a year then once they know each other is really game they become good friends ive fought all of my close friends we dont shoot each other usually so its all goodso because everyone knows that everyone has to fight at least sometimes older relatives start training you at a very young age and force you to spar with your friend is for me this started around 4th grade a lot of guys just want to see how tough you are but it is dangerous now a lot i mean a lot of guys 25 and younger have trained bjj muay thai andor boxing once that comes into play it is not fair anymoreif you ever see the guam boys in the ufc they are the same smiling and egging the other guy on enjoying the violence that is guam lolalso respect is a huge huge deal here there are no yo mama jokes that dont lead to a fightlol did i just describe prison
628	1	this is me too ive learned a lot about myself and our history over the past few years when it comes to our time in the country i figured our situation with these stories being repressed couldnt be unique and subbed to two native subs it is been extremely eye opening i grew up in an area with a pretty strong native american population too but we learned nothing about their history outside of the cheesy thanksgiving story they give to every kid across the nation
629	1	i had no idea this was such a complicated rich history thank you so much for clueing me in on how incredible this is i always wondered a little how spain and latin america were related and i can see a little better why you came here for some input obviously we still cant make rulings but i think maybe some of us will at least be able to offer some original points of view and fresh insight i wouldnt be surprised if we all say something different given the complexity of the matter i have a fuzzy head right now because im sick or id really delve into it with you but what i do think i can say is that you obviously have your heart in the right place and are utilising information wonderfully i do feel that with the right intentions in the case of the mestizo celebrating indigeneity and keeping the spirit of the original land and its people is _rebelling_ against the gentrification and assimilation that spain brought we have a lot of intermarriage here ourselves and having a white or other colonising parent doesnt make you less native by the belief systems of most of our tribes some exceptions do use blood quantum however we arent erased that easily celebrate your roots and keep them alive
630	1	thats so cool the fact that indigenous languages are so widely known in latin america is really incredible here were facing major crises where almost all our languages are in critical danger of extinction some of them have less than five speakers left
631	1	i know elizabeth lapensee she is not a white woman she is metis
632	1	gt i know you guys in the states have your own ways but why do we always have to fight fighting gets us nowhere as evidenced by all these years of going nowherewhat exactly are you categorizing as fighting like the vast majority of fights are the legal battles you talk about immediately afterwards followed by protests and snappy hashtags actual physical violent fights that arent policeprivate securityetc giving a one sided beatdown to a protester just dont happen
633	1	agreed im more concerned about the kind of pretendian that infiltrates indigenous positions scholarship and policy almost 20 years later my family and i are still recovering from a situation involving all three and md indian politics of all things in the end we and pamunkey were stuck with bills the other side retained their platform and ability of go to ivy league schools on a bs family of heriditary chiefs linethree questions i ask in these situations1 did the individuals work or goals concern a misappropriated identity2 did the individual actually benefit from the misrepresentation and3 did the individual continue mislabeling themselves once confronted with the problems concerning their claimed identityfor warren the answer for all three is no the same cant be said for susan taffreed or andrea smithi can understand people wanting a price paid and i agree that one should from watrennand harvard but we disagree on the what of iti want this to be used as leverage against harvard to secure actual indigenous hires against warren i want this as leverage to flip her for favorable federal indian policy and law  i can imagine favorable outcomes from any of the acknowledged cherokee groups involving negotiated mutual supportif it wasnt clear i would rather own a senator than destroy one not my call but i see no evidence that this was even contemplated it should be
634	1	that sounds like a good idea i completely understand your basis for wanting to include people in the depiction but it is tough to navigate all the nuances
635	1	gt the pipeline was permitted as a huge set of small projects all said to be so small they didnt require environmental reviewdo you have a source for that
636	1	so did i graduated with 5 d is and 1 a and technically i shouldnt have passed on 2 accounts where one of them d is was supposed to be an f and i didnt finish the pass packet
637	1	is this for 1491
638	1	yeah this huge and costly state surveillance apparatus annihilating basic rights to privacy and they find that some natives are doing a taco fundraiser raffle and jam session at the friendship centre in barrie and they then call an emergency multiagency meeting which by its nature comes at great cost to figure out how to respond to these perceived threatshuhwhite people are crazy
639	1	sure man httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvf7cw7s0zxv4
640	1	i apologize  im not familiar enough with this subject to be able to answer  had an american education
641	1	i do appreciate mods keeping on top of extremely problematic posts such as the above i also ponder whether locking rather than out and out deleting some of these posts which have collected well thought out rebuttals might be helpful to consider doing so may serve to educate people as to the fallacies of the common colonialist arguments presented
642	1	than is a very good point about those who dont read comments they click on the link assume it is legit and get sucked in to the fraudulent site it seems there is no perfect answer to a lot of these issues it would be nice to leave it with rebuttals to educate people about the fraud and get the message out but in the specific dynamics of discussion boards designed with links the way it is here as opposed to perhaps a blog post with annotated references it has the potential to mislead more people than it educates thanks
643	1	hes just goofing off and and having fun at your expense i know it might seem like hes being a dick but its just his rez humor and cheekiness dont die on this hill
644	1	i am really torn about selfgovernance from what i have seen and experienced many times there doesnt seem to be a healthy system of checks and balances for many tribes too often the apparatus of government are effectively controlled by what could be defined as one party the result is that the opposition is often silenced thereby mooting the effectiveness of those using the public forum to change or influence decisions during open comment sessions
645	1	exactly  in dramatic situations capitalize on others ignorance harness their lack of empathyi like gilbert sheltons fabulous furry freak brothers i read those long before superhero comics they were sort of antiheroes my dad had their whole collectionone comic series i forgot to mention was the original conan the barbarian it made me want to show how badass my people are too even though he wasnt indigenous conan was also one of the only long hair ass kicking characters i could look up to
646	1	as for the mƒÅh≈´ part i left it vague because its something im still actively learning about  so much was lost  one of the most influential people who are educating lahui about the hawaiian societal position and significance of mƒÅh≈´ today is kumu hinaleimoana wong  theres a documentary about her called kumu hina and tons of other media too    i dont wanna f it up but what i got out of it so far is that mƒÅh≈´ were people said to possess both kane and wahine mana  and we see this all the time in our everyday observation  there are many feminine men and masculine women  it doesnt necessarily refer to sexual orientation but it can  because of this they held a unique position in society and were a good choice to select to be in positions of power and influence they were able to provide a unique perspective  in other words mƒÅh≈´ were an acknowledged and accepted part of society  they were designated their own gender identity and their unique perspective was used for the benefit of lahui rather than just discarded or marginalized
647	1	i had not heard of it before maybe because i dont have facebook i loved it my parents ordered their own set as soon as we got home i love how its advertised as a native teaching game i think it would be very interesting to play with a nonnative although i dont think they would find it nearly as enjoyable we had to find a way to explain it to the applebees employees who were asking what it was im still not sure they understood us telling them its cards against humanity for natives
648	1	thank you
649	1	if trump did this i would react differently and here is whytrump has a long career as a conman that lies to get what he wants he is lacks honor integrity class and every other positive characteristics that people strive for he is morally bankrupt and he is not to be trusted if he did this of course it would look much more calculatedi can forgive her because she seems to be genuinely good person she may not have addressed this topic directly since being called out on it but she sure has done more than most when it comes to helping many people in the native community by defending the working class in general
650	1	i was born in a place called medell√≠n colombia this place too has multiple influences from indigenous cultures freed africans and european settlers largely from the basque people and southern spain i have a feeling that i am mestizo due to my fairly nonwhite phenotype and the fact that my dad is even darker however phenotypes arent everything they can vary a lot between people my mom and her mother are pasty white but her dad looks like a light skin black and she has siblings that look brown like me plus there is essentially no way of knowing which indigenous group i am even descendent from and most likely i am not descendent from just one in colombia though a lot of people take pride in being spanish a lot of others take pride in being indigenous descent because the chibcha muisca people were the most well known people and their history was taught in school most people identify with them ive heard the term chibchombiano more than one given the location of the muisca though what is now bogot√° and the surrounding regions i have doubts i am descendent from them most likely i am descendent from the less flashy hunter gatherer groups that lived in what is now antioquia or the northern coast where most immigrants passed throughalso i can understand and respect your views but personally i still identify as mestizo hispanic and latino that is because mestizo is the only word so far that fits my racial identity hispanic and latino simply reflect the reality that i was born and raised into a european society and culture yes though it is unfortunate i cannot deny reality i wasnt raised in an indigenous community i was raised in a hispanic one however if it makes you feel better i identify more with my basque heritage than my castilian one since though they were complicit in colonization too they were an oppressed community back in spain
651	1	here is audio and a transcript of a speech he gave last november where he mentions the scheme you dont have to do an environmental impact study on de minimus projects which are inconsequential and are less than 1 acre in size so energy transfer partners applied for hundreds of separate permits for 1 acre projects that dont require an environmental impact study legally their position was that there is no pipeline project there is only hundreds of separate unrelated tiny projects that just happen to involve a pipe on an acre of land the federal government under the last administration rubber stamped this approach and said sure ok guys what youre doing sounds totally legitimate to us it is definitely hundreds of unrelated 1 acre de minimus projects and we agree no environmental impact study is necessary robert kennedy has been pointing out that this is a total scam by energy transfer partners also the fact the feds approved this and accepted this reasoning is deeply questionable and i personally wonder who got paid off to approve this since there is no way it was honestly evaluated once this was pointed out though the whole thing should have been permanently halted immediately and criminal investigations against etp started and corruption investigations into the officials who approved it instead we got war dogs people in kennels and grenades with absolutely no protection of our civil or human rights from the feds who just let the state militarized police and private mercenaries do as they pleasedhttpsmediumcomadaburrowsrobertbobbyfkennedyjrspeaksatstandingrock67e8b0931625gt you cant build a pipeline without doing an environmental impact statement ask the people who made the xl pipeline the reason that they  the loophole that they are using is a loophole this  theyre violating the first environmental law and the most important environmental law that we passed before even earth day in 1969 we passed nepa the national environmental policy act and that act said that for the first time it said that anybody or any company or anybody else that wants to diminish the value of publicly owned lands or commons or do a large project thats going to change the use of public resources that first they have to do a cost benefit analysis and we call that an environmental impact statement they have to show how this project is effecting people who what the benefits are to our country and what the costs aregt our congress recognized that for some projects that required a federal permit if you wouldnt would to do a full environmental impact statement for  very small projects and in fact the thing that they discussed at that time is that if you have a dock that goes out into the water into the ocean you need a corp of engineers permit to replace a pylon does that person have to do a full environmental impact statement and congress said no we dont want that to happen for de minimus projects for inconsequential projects well let them do something else an environmental assessment but they have to be a project that has minimal impact and minimal potential for impact and it also has less than one acre of impactgt well this pipeline using bald chicanery said that theyre going to take advantage of that environmental assessment that shortcut theyre pretending that this pipeline which is 1200 miles long is a oneacre project well thats just a lie its clearly illegal their clearly breaking the law and the people of this camp are standing up and saying all we want is law and order all we want is compliance with the federal law and the state instead of supporting the people who are asking for law and order is deploying the awesome military power of this state against the people who are asking for law and order on behalf of the criminal on behalf of the person who is breaking our wind masks word and who is breaking the law and this is a this whats happening here is a metaphor for whats been happening for the last 500 years with the treaty of laramie and all these other examples where the native people sign a treaty or theyre assured what they law should be and then a wealthy individual a wealthy company sees something shiny on the land that they want and the federal government and the state government instead of saying well theres a law that prohibits you from doing that is deploying sound weapons and tear gas an uh and pepper spray and all of these other weapons against the people who are just sitting here demanding law and order
652	1	id like to ask you to message the moderators here with this concern please that way all the mods can see this and a consensus can be made thank you
653	1	you know theres this great african leader his name is prof plo lumumba and he said  the european tribes the europeans never call themselves tribes they call them nations  what is unique about the european nations is that when they are engaged in tribal wars they call them world wars  it really speaks to the false superiority western civilization imposed across the world  our cultures and styles of government are no more valid than theirs   theirs are riddled with corruption injustice and mismanaged resources  it is time to cut the cord and to stop allowing their perceptions of the world to be the standards by which we judge our world  love and aloha froman independence advocate
654	1	aaayy
655	1	because in doing so they then become members of the host nation  important to note is that whether that immigrant is allowed to enter into the territory and whether or not citizenship would be approved is at the discretion of the nation itself
656	1	i pose to you that you look at it this waywithin the northeast the netherlands the kingdom of france sweden and the uk each had their colonies prior to it just becoming the uk canada and the us the netherlands could hypothetically pay restitutions along with the united states canada and maybe even the beloved swedes but then we get to the murkier bit with francetheyre not a kingdom anymore french revolution the republic napoleon the republic again napoleon again the republic again vichy france and back to the republic does that mean that france still could still pay for whatever atrocitiesexploitationsetc that happened in their colonies and interactions with the tribes there yesbut there is quite a bit of wiggle room with the whole kingdomrepublicempirerepublicempirerepublicnazi occupationrepublic in that they arent the same france that had the colonies
657	1	such a poignant yet powerful quote
658	1	gila river arizona
659	1	yes i think we all here agree that only we have the right to determine our citizenship criteria this right is not subject to review by outside entities and scotus has upheld and agreed with this position as wellin this case white earth is constitution used to have a 25 blood quantum requirement of minnesota ojibwe only in 2013 they approved a new constitution that changed the citizenship requirement to completely remove blood quantum and have it be by ancestry onlyas her grandmother is a white earth citizen then under the new constitution the grandchild is going to be one as welli bet the hennepin county attorney who was advising looked at their 1961 constitution and his guess of the child is blood quantum and then guessed she wasnt eligible for membership which isnt his to determine and was a bad guess since he was using outdated documentsbased on their current constitution it is clear that the child is eligible for white earth citizenship and the county attorney is wrong and is wasting everyone is time by trying to argue that icwa doesnt apply
660	1	correct no us law empowers a president to shrink or eliminate a national monument it has to be granted to the presidency by an act of congress or a reinterpretation of the antiquities act by the courtsbasically trump said he could do it and did it and then there will be an emergency injunction and the matter were be decided by the courts
661	1	the founder lee francis mentioned to me that comic 2018 will be at the university of calgary could be 2019 it was really hot in albuquerque that day so my mind was focused only on keeping cool so rather than the 4 day drive i undertook for this years event it will be a 5minute walk and much more bearable weather
662	1	communal taco production sounds awesome
663	1	sure here is a historical recording of this phenomenon  i just found it and i found it interesting  its from ad infinitum a biography of latin by nicholas ostierhttpsbooksgooglecombooksidypoeqjtw1e0camppgpa306amplpgpa306ampdqhawaiiantoenglishmotherolderbrotherauntampsourceblampotsptaanutyoiampsignjm4jbpn42g8x2u5xwaigh0tng4amphlenampsaxampved0ahukewj0xpld94jyahvfwgmkhu58dvwq6aeiytahvonepageampqhawaiian20to20english20mother20older20brother20auntampffalse gt in a hawaiian system all kin of the same generation get one term if they are male and another if female your mother is not distinguished from an aunt nor a son from a nephew there was no way to call a person specifically mother because no word existed at the time  makuahine extends to all kin and even nonkin of the same social status as your mother did  it wasnt culturally or socially significant enough of a relationship to have its own word the only thing you could really do was add the term  l≈´au ªi ahead of makuahine i suppose and that would refer to being a true biological parent  later mƒÅmƒÅ was added to mean mom but thats based off of the english word just like ƒÅnake and anakala were added for aunt and uncle  i think this is significant because it meant that responsibility was equally shared for children  to me it shows that the entire generation above was equally responsible for the generation below and so who your mom or dad was wasnt too important  looking through the writings of the other posts it seems this is a concept we shared  in the moku honu nations it was the aunties and uncles who raised the keiki  the parents were only there for some extra love and support  this is good thinking to me  thats the healthiest way to raise keiki everyone needs to do it  having 3 keiki myself its insane to think that 2 people can do it alone  in fact parents may be too emotionally invested to make the best decisions for their keiki anyhow
664	1	interesting comment utrap_pots seems like every time i encounter you here youve got something unsavory to express are you offended here in this subreddit more oft than not  how is elizabeth lapens√©e equated in your view as a white woman because she is not up to your personal standards of blood quantum
665	1	this may be a good thing to ask in rmetisnation it has few subscribers and can go months without a new post but im noticing that most of the posts have multiple comments which is very promising even if its only a few people they seem to be active and engaged in the sub i think its important to realise that recognising and celebrating your heritage isnt always a matter of authenticity im having trouble putting this into words for us in the us someone with 0 ties to a tribe whos 116th cherokee by coloniser vocabulary staging a sun dance would be an issue because there are cherokee who live as cherokee and thats when authenticity comes into play but youre talking about being the most authentic that there is right now you are whats left youre the footprints of your ancestors you are the most authentic that there is
666	1	i actually just confirmed my subscription p
667	1	lolthe author cites 4 as meanwhile federal programs that serve tribes are flounderingthis isnt any new newsihs amp other federal programs have been broken for a very long time
668	1	thanks i feel like the general populace and the ops benefit from education about these sites so i prefer to call out the posts as i did above with sources of the original and links to investigative journalism that has outed this fraud if we just delete them and no one sees them then more casual visitors dont know about what is going on with these fake sites and dont have an opportunity to join in in helping to identify the fraudulent sites i wonder if there is some way to block further new posts on a topic with a mod flag explaining what the deal is but without just vanishing all history of what happened which can hold back on folks getting wise as to these scams and helping police them
669	1	thank you very much i feel overwhelmed with the support ive been shown after posting this this is really kind of a big deal for me and it is lovely to see you and everyone else showing appreciation and validation for this thank you againps these resources thank you very much i actually started learning the language but lost my books and tapes when i moved  it was difficult to find a good resource again so thank you again
670	1	gtin order to not be a colonizer of the dakota nationdid the dakota see themselves as one nation were taking some mighty big leaps in logic here that shouldnt be applied to the majority of the continental united states and the tribes therein just as an example in your hypothetical scenario washington state would become a mass of nationstates and that is even if were only going by federally recognized tribes if we went by historical and unrecognized tribes itd be full of citystates instead which would be seen as a severe pain in the ass along with the extreme restructuring that current recognized tribes would have to undergo for membershipthis kinda ties into the first bit about the dakota being a single nation or not modern tribes across the northwest are occasionally made up of several tribes that were made up of semiautonomous villages that were sometimes allied via marriage
671	1	yeahthats illegal collect damages and find a new job worth it
672	1	what kind of neighborhood were you running throughmine is kinda out of the way and we rarely get anyone walking down our way that isnt me or another of our neighbors people who do walk down our road are usually homeless and are viewed with extreme suspicion if someone just randomly ran down our road theyd very likely get dirty looks
673	1	posoh and thank you so much for your response that sounds like a perfect gift for her either for next christmas or her birthday and starting to think about now gives me plenty of time to find the perfect one no worries at all re pms its a crazy time of year i know it would be pretty funny to find a relative on redditi have done a bit of genealogy work on my end so id love to compare notes and see if we can find a connection happy holidays to you and your family as well i hope your staying warm and cozy i look forward to hearing from you when things settle down  waewaenon again

676	1	gt also again in the lakota sioux areagtojibwa warrior gtdennis bankscreates the american indian movementusually a lurker but i gotta say you probably know this but for other readers dennis banks was ojibwe very much not lakota ojibwe and dakota historically were not on friendly terms dakota and ojibwe people fought for a long time mainly in what is now the state of minnesota oh the difference between l n and dakota is in dialect and geographic distribution not so much a tribal difference thought id mention it since some people dont realize this  i havent read the book and i know he was one of the founders but i feel to say that he created aim is a little strong im also inclined to treat some of the things people like banks and russell means claim with a healthy dose of skepticism since they tend towards selfaggrandizement ive noticed many of the aim leaders are far more controversial in native communities than they are at universities or at least within my own family im dakota if it makes a difference
677	1	gt when indigenous heritage sites burial grounds and sacred places or other types of indigenous heritage are intentionally denigrated destroyed or appropriated it is both a form of violence and a human rights violationi agree fully that everything archaeologists do to our ancestors is a human rights violation
678	1	gtin washington there were a few chamoru guys i want to say half a dozen the local kkk types didnt like it so they harassed them whenever they went out one night they got into it at a bar the chamorus left and the kkk chased them down in their trucks chamorus stopped and beat tf out of them so they called the cops  i love a happy ending although it is messed up at the chamorus were the ones who got arrested even if the charges were dropped selfdefense shouldnt be met with arrest what part of washington was it some of my family lives in eastern washington im kinda worried about the racists out theregttldr basically everyone on guam has been doing fight club shit since we were in elementary mma was famous island wide since the mid late 90s and we have the highest percentage of ufc fighters of any stateterritory dont fuck with chamorus lol wow i knew a lot of mma fighters came from guam but i had no idea about the rest   when you say everyone you mean like everyone boys and girls what fighting styles do kids learn that is really really cool i grew up fighting but it was basically hurt the other person worse than you get hurt absolutely nothing artful or even strategic gtalso the only punishment that happened with me was when they painted my locker and i hit a guy with a chair and mounted him the officers called it evendid anyone mess with you after that i hope not gtno the e5 wasnt punished beyond his bruises lol btw i added a bit to my last commentdamn also thanks for adding moregtyeah i saw that vid those mighty island cats are really good id love to work with them one day there speaker also spoke at the un a few months ago also very moving stuffthanks for mentioning it  ill be sure to look it up

683	1	thank you we arent thanked very often
684	1	which reservation it is hard to give a good answer with limited information
685	1	lucky
686	1	i think the point you may be missing is that the term colonizer is a relative term  it describes a relationship between two parties 1 the colonizers2 the colonized in your example of the dutchman immigrant you describe 2 separate scenariosa the dutchmans relationship with the usb the dutchmans relationship with the dakotain scenario a the dutchman is not a colonizer he is an immigrantin scenario b the dutchman is a colonizer because as a result of a he become a member of the colonizing force the us against the dakota the colonized    yet although a contributed in part to b both scenarios should be considered separate the colonizercolonized relationship is one of peoples not individual people
687	1	that is perfect thank you
688	1	thats right  every single nonnative us citizen is the direct beneficiary of the massacre of our peoples and the theft of our lands  it doesnt matter how kind or moral they are  the fact that they1 did not have to apply for a visa to visit here 2 did not gain permission from the territories they inhabit to reside there 3 pay taxes to support a foreign government already profiting from the natural resources of this beautiful land4 are not subject to the laws of the rightful owners of the territories in which they residemake all of them direct beneficiaries of the massacre geonocide rape and pillaging of all native peoples of the americas  this is true of all american citizens who were granted their citizenship either through sanction by the us government or inherited through their us citizen parents  all natives contrarily were made to be us citizens by force  and you know what nearly seven belgiums fit into the confines of washington state  q what makes the nation of belgium a country and the native nations like the sioux mere tribes  a a colonized mind which has fallen for the racist falsehoods whose origins lie in white supremacy  their civilizations are no more valid than ours are    they are no more capable than we are at governing ourselves  we are more than capable of governing ourselves and managing our own lands and natural resources
689	1	incorporating cultural valuesim a firm believer in harnessing traditional cultural values to achieve integritybased results respect humility love truth honesty bravery and wisdom are a road map to career and life success when one learns to harness the power of traditional values their ascension and progress is guaranteed my graphic novels adhere to this overall belief in fact my napi graphic novel is more of a self help book  using the lessons of napi and the power of storytelling it shows readers how to harness values to achieve their goalsthoughts on blood quantumi have no thoughts on blood quantum  i leave that to the professionals however it brings up a conversation i had recently about the possibility of my descendants not being able to register for membership in my tribe it is much more complicated than my brain can absorb but this is about whatif is so bear with me  my kids i have 3 are 14 blackfoot i am 12 blackfoot they are all registered members let is say all my kids marry nontribal members their children will have a much more difficult time becoming tribal members let is say all my grandchildren and greatgrandchildren marry nontribal members almost guaranteed they would be denied membership in my tribe at that point are we still blackfoot anymore should one marry for love or marry for tribal affiliation crazy to think aboutfoodhome cooked food is best  fried kidney stew and frybread and indian tacos are my top three
690	1	gtyeah so guam is different lol we still have cockfighting and stuff too so here its like weak people need to fight until people stop messing with them normal people fight so they arent thought of as weak and strong people fight for the challenge because it is funim sure it is different in a lot of ways but this is actually really similar to how things were where i grew up like what kind of person fights for what reason gtmany times people will fightspar 2 or 3 times over the course of a year then once they know each other is really game they become good friends ive fought all of my close friends we dont shoot each other usually so its all goodthat is really cool once people are friends do they train together and share techniques im glad people usually dont shoot one another gtso because everyone knows that everyone has to fight at least sometimes older relatives start training you at a very young age and force you to spar with your friend is for me this started around 4th grade were you nervous when you first started learning or maybe excited when relatives train their little ones do they teach kids how to fight fair like no hairpulling fingers in eyes bending fingers back fishhooks etc will you teach your kids or niecesnephews i tried to teach my little sister how to fight but im seven inches shorter than her so i have no idea what to teach hergta lot of guys just want to see how tough you are but it is dangerous now a lot i mean a lot of guys 25 and younger have trained bjj muay thai andor boxing once that comes into play it is not fair anymorethat makes sense bjj is nuts i dont know anything about muay thai boxing is nuts too i dont know how to talk about fighting like the terms and things but do people usually fight standing up like boxers or do people usually fight on the ground is fighting a social activity like for fun like you mentioned as often as it can be a way to settle disputesnot related  have you ever seen capoeira it is a really pretty style of fighting that looks like dancing it looks like it takes a lot of energy thoughgtif you ever see the guam boys in the ufc they are the same smiling and egging the other guy on enjoying the violence that is guam lolthat sounds really fun and really cute do have any favorite fighters you would recommend checking outgtalso respect is a huge huge deal here there are no yo mama jokes that dont lead to a fightgtlol did i just describe prisonthanks for sharing it is really cool to learn about
691	1	also to echo off of your last point there is a peruvian news channelhttpsyoutubeonrwcu8kpog that operates in the native language of the land so that people can reconnect with the original culture i find it pretty important to keep the culture alive and to possibly reverse assimilation perhaps we can try that in colombia before our own languages die offsome of them speak a little unnatural but i guess those are the growing pains in the revival process
692	1	thank you so much both are great suggestions
693	1	that is a mistake on my part i forgot it also covered western africa and eurasia and not just the americas
694	1	i am reading this now and have a question  what evidence backs up his claim that indians traded for european ships or recovered shipwrecks learned to sail them and became a rising part of coastal trade in new england  he supports his other histories in the notes at the end of his book but does not provide sources for this claim
695	1	the article doesnt explain the basis for this unfortunate decision  seems inconsistent with its other decision
696	1	well everybody knows that brown people cant help but talk about overthrowing governments and such when they eat tacoss
697	1	more like the three shitstersamiright guysÔæü„ÉÆÔæü
698	1	gtas citizens of the offending nation they comprise the beneficiaries of the horrors that occurred the same is true for the colonizedthats it i dont care about lucas the dutchman or his ugly sons or their hypothetical migration¬π they were doing this all on behalf of the united states for the benefit of the us which raises another can of worms on indian scouts but that is for later ¬π to be 100 clear the dutchman and co were just an example of immigrants integrating themselves into us society and benefiting from the colonization of insert tribe territory

702	1	i live in toronto i might just have to check out this committee
703	1	exactly there is a lot of pride in doing what you can even if its not a lot i imagine that when that happens its an effect of classism like the idea that the spanish is more educated than the native term that goes with the idea that colonisers are more refined than the indigenous so responding to that is actually a really wonderful place to start it directly targets gentrification
704	1	lol i know how you feel on that  no the only reason i added ad infinitum is because it provides concrete written evidence that no term for motherfather existed  its hard to prove things regarding our history due to the nature of how this information is passed down orally or through talkstory as you said  to be real i just threw it in to show i wasnt making things up for real im not making any of these things up  since its reddit though we need sources and all that
705	1	i dont want to say i know everything that everybody does or says but in my experience outsiders say western cherokee those of us who are cherokee nation or ukb just say cherokee nation or ukb im cherokee nation myself dont see any reason to apply for ukb membership i wish theyd get over this need to be separate and claim theyre the real inheritors of the old cherokee nation but anyway that is a different story my aunt says were bird clan although i dont know if it matters much anymore cherokee nation doesnt have blood quantum and yeah that is controversial if you want a good talk with a lot of cherokee though you need to be on facebook theyre really not over here on reddit
706	1	thank you for responding so let me get this straight basically its not that the inuit dont want to be catagorized feels weird writing that with fn na the government just flipped flopped all over the place in deciding how they should be classified edted a sentence

711	1	there are tribal canoe journeys in the wa or bc area and we had someone post thishttpiimgurcombk6qx7zpng on the canoe family is page once we got to canada back in august
712	1	its possible but all of those countries have in essence relinquished their control of the lands to the us canada and mexico by spain  they could hypothetically owe restitution but really the brunt of the burden lies with the us canada and mexico for north america in my opinion
713	1	thank you at this point i dont know if i should talk to her or mention to my hr hr wouldnt brush it aside i think ill just have a conversation with her and let her know that i am not ok with her with her doing this and let her know exactly why
714	1	yeah good call there is a vibe there that anything other than full assimilation to presumedly superior and best white culture is some form of racismthese kinds like to cherrypick cases where they argue that the child might possibly be better off in some way  usually financially and perhaps through exposure to what they see as the one true religion theirs  if they were placed with a good white familyive studied the us foster care systems quite a bit sexual and mental abuse are rampant within it protections for children essentially nonexistent and scores of people join the system because they get money to warehouse lots of kids while attempting to indoctrinate them in some alien and bizarre western religious beliefdelusion systemi think this argument can be reversedlets look at all the abuses of innocent children in the white run and administered foster care systemwe know that raising children under indigenous care systems and families in general produces healthier happier more balanced more thoughtful considerate and competent people this is clearly the superior system therefore all children whether white black yellow red or otherwise should be taken from whoever they are with and placed with indigenous nations since we have the best way of raising children in the white run system they suffer brutality and systematic sexual and mental abuse in indigenous systems they dont for the best interests of the children all should be placed with tribal people and taken away from the abusive western people regardless of the race or circumstance of the children
715	1	sorry i had my taxes mixed up the tea tax was to help domestic british tea corporations by taxing tea imported from other than british tea corporationsi was thinking of the stamp tax which was to pay for the indian warsbut yeah what i said is my take on that french territory has a lot of indians and a few french trappers most of whom are married to indian women and have made traditional marriage alliances with them allowing the french to live safely in their territory while claiming to outsiders it is actually french territory britain wants to fight france and they want dead indians so they get indians in their own territory to ally with them by promising eternal friendship and have them go fight the french aligned indians the french then promise the indians on their side the same thing to go fight the british aligned indians so now we have indian killing indian while the french and british colonists sit back and laugh afterwards both white sides renege on all their promises to indians the whites have their own explanation for things and dont agree with what i just said i look at the strategy and the outcome whites make promises to get indians to kill indians while whites claim more territory and then renege on promises complete win for the whites regardless of which white side claims to have won
716	1	yes though she jokes about being adopted into the tribe and she is from thailand but that sums it up

719	1	indians the only minority its not only acceptable to be racist towards but even celebrated and encouraged whatever though its important that as minorities we all stand together and support each other in any and every way possible it may have taken a disgusting atrocious demagogue to light the fire but i believe that it has started and an unstoppable change is on the horizon black middle eastern muslim hispaniclatino asian native gay straight trans were all in this together were the ones that can make this country great because were the ones who made this fucking country 2018 is gonna be a big year 2020 is gonna be even bigger

729	1	glad to see him comparing native tribes to the punk rock scene right
730	1	personally i dont think this one was a false flag since it seems they took credit for it at the time and have celebrated it as a noble act of defiance ever sincefor a true false flag against indians check out the awful mountain meadows massacre the mormon church in utah had their own private militia they decided to mass murder a nonmormon wagon train that was simply passing through utah on the way to california the wanted to steal their resources and property they successfully executed the plan murdering 120 men women and children their plan was to leave no evidence they did it so they dressed up as paiutes and then spread lies saying the paiutes did it and calling for the killing of innocent paiutes in retaliation people who had nothing to do with any of this it seems that in addition to the motivation of stealing property there was also a motivation to frame the paiutes whose territory the mormons were illegally occupying portraying the indians as inhuman monsters and thus encouraging their eradicationthere have been attempts in modern times to place markers to the dead at the massacre site but when it is done local mormons come and destroy the markers
731	1	the last one reminds me of the time jason was visiting us after hostess briefly left the us we went to a tribal smoke shop near the house when he bought a cupcake ripped it out of the wrapper and ate it at the counter like he was starving we left out to his car when he mentioned that his wife wasnt allowing sweets at the house for a timethen that is about the time when he discovered mcdonald is in the us offered sweet tea
732	1	etp and tigerswan are evil this is a very strange thing for an indigenous person to sayin indigenous thinking things are seen across a spectrum extreme absolutes like good and evil are not present those are so often exaggerations but when you see something with only evil and no good what should we call it white claims of absolute evil committed represented and presented by us are not an exaggeration but a complete and total fallacy on every level their generally widely chanted claim of our evil our being savages itself is evil itself for five hundred years they have used those words to describe our peaceful and friendly peoples and our lives and our life sustaining beautiful practices of respect egalitarianism and sustainabilitya problem once we are driven to such absolutes because one side insists on absolute evil as their position what is possible other than total war until the end they certainly outclass us in their machinery and elements of death so the result is predictable we die the earth dies everyone dies all ends however this does not mean we should shy from protection of our lands our ancestors our culture our language our ways it is our responsibility and legacy to protect our ancestors and those which give us and the world life
733	1	dont get me wrong i dont think that republicans should feel entitled to the land either way native peoples shouldnt have to move whenever a new administration wants to become chummy with energy and mining companies
734	1	oki niskuni i am doing great it is great to hear from you i am pleased youre here too i am always working on stuff  publishing new authors works and my napi children is series are the main things right now there is a constant flow of new books launching monthly sometimes weekly
735	1	thanks for sharing  i love to see the similarities between our different societies  we didnt have specific names for our biological parents either  the word we used was makua and it referred to anyone from the generation of your parents  makuahine referred to motheraunt and makuakane referred to fatheruncle  i interpret the significance of this to mean that the entire generation above is equally responsible for the entire generation below  we continue this today except using english titles for the most part death of language  hanai was also common with is similar to adoption except it meant the adding of another set of parents not the transfer  so the child would be the responsibility of both families and would still belong to both families  its also similar that like you guys we recognized more than two genders also  we had three and the third was called mƒÅh≈´ and it represented the people who were  inbetween the male and female genders
736	1	munchies on the mind
737	1	yeah its really interesting  what was more important than blood relation was the generational relationships or the generationalhierarchical relationship of one person to anothermakua  means eldersenior parent aunt uncle and any relative of parents generation neither masculine nor femininemakuahine  means elder feminine mother aunt female of parents generationmakua kƒÅne  means elder masculine father uncle male of parents generationmakuahine makua  means elder of elder feminine a female relative older than or senior to your mothermakua kƒÅne makua  means elder of elder masculine a male relative older than or senior to your fathermakuahine ≈çpio  means younger of elder feminine a female relative younger than your mothermakua kƒÅne ≈çpio  means younger of elder masculine a male relative younger than your father keiki  child son daughter nephew niece a person of the lower generation neither masculine nor femininekaikuana  elder sibling or cousin of the same sex eg elder brother of a male or older female cousin of a femalekaikaina  younger sibling or cousin of the same sexkaikuahine  sister or female cousin of a malekaikunƒÅne  brother or male cousin of a male so whats very interesting is that it isnt possible to differentiate how bloodrelated or not someone is example there is no difference between an aunt or mother however it is possible to distinguish the age or generational position of one person to the next it shows that there was a special respect given from younger to elder and a responsibility of the elder over the younger  love that its also interesting to see that there isnt an age differentiation across genders   for example you can say uncle older than my father but not aunt older than my father  a young boy cant say older sister just sister  its interesting that the respectresponsibility relationship seemed separated by gender  i guess thats instinctual  personally i look after my younger sisters but i instinctively look to my male cousins to correct my younger brother  must be the kanaka way xd

743	1	have you tried looking up any anthropological historical political or native research studies about precolumbian medell√≠n my country is much smaller than colombia and many research studies on precolumbian indigenous societies and their continuity over the past 525 years exist for a while i also thought that id never be able to determine my indigenous ancestry but found lots of reliable studies that i was able to triangulate with oral historiesi do struggle with your last point about being racially mestizo and culturally hispaniclatino as campesinos from where i am from did not become latinos out of free will becoming latinohispanic was out of necessity and survival as it resulted in upward mobility and material benefits that would have never been granted if they had not adopted this identity as for mestizo my understanding is that this was a term imposed by the spaniards as part of the caste system in order to divide the people yes i am mixed spanish and indigenous but i want to avoid giving ligitemacy and recognition to identities imposed by those who have killed raped and stolen from my ancestors by calling myself and identifying with their concepts that continue to serve their will despite declaring independence from spain i strongly feel like i must purge this from my colonized mind by learning more about my indigenous ancestors as latinohispanic culture in my country praise white supremacy and colonialism i must admit that i may be somewhat incorrect as i lack national context seeing that i do not live in my home country but from what i gather racism inequalities and discriminations against indigenous peoples and black peoples continue to be major issues dating back to spain is colonial caste systemi guess this is my way to try to consolidate my mestizaje i am careful not to say that i am indigenous altho i do say that i have indigenous ancestry and i definitely do not acknowledge any spanish descendants thankfully they go way back and are not worth doing any research on they can suck it ha ha

752	1	gt i love how its advertised as a native teaching game i think it would be very interesting to play with a nonnative although i dont think they would find it nearly as enjoyablei would love to play that game with an appropriate crowd  however i lived on the nn for many years so id at least get some of the inside rezjokes  i think youre right though that the majority of nonnatives would not be able to truly appreciate it  i think a mixedculture gaming group would need to know each other fairly well because the game is inherent tongueincheek cynicism could easily be mistaken for racist dickholery

760	1	i agree
761	1	oh wow thanks sharing that i had never heard of this before and to me it sounds like the most damning piece of evidence
762	1	thanks this is a very good article and covers the legal issues well it also has good references such as this articlehttplegalplanetorg20170508politiciansandcommentatorswhocriticizerecentnationalmonumentsaremakinguptheirownversionofhistory which debunks several common arguments by criticsgt since that time no president until trump has attempted to revoke or downsize any national monument ive discovered that when discussing this issue some people will argue that many previous presidents downsized or revoked national monuments and the latest case is nothing special or different when asked for specifics theyll give a national forest that was later opened up for logging as an example the article above points out though that national forests and national monuments are different things and while forests are explicitly allowed to be modified or revoked by executive decision the law makes no such provision for monuments there are also some cases of national monuments being revoked but in those cases they were done through specific act of congress so when discussing this issue dont be surprised to be told that lots of presidents have revoked things and be prepared to know how to rebut that claim ask what incident they are referring to and then point out what actually happened and their argument falls apart

769	1	alright i think i see what happened here youre alaska native yeah the way you worded your post it sounds like many of the ones we get from nonnatives on here bob is a straight shooter kinda guy and tells like it is frequent enough are these kinds of questions that some users dont beat around the bush anymore and while it might be overly candid that is the attitude some natives have and we have chosen not to censor it since it is a genuine native voice

782	1	if we look at this in context it makes a little more sense to racist being white is about purity a drop of the wrong genes and it is ruinedif another race is going to get certain rights regardless if it is actually tribal affiliation that determines native status the same concept has to apply

784	1	just so that you know i didnt downvote you ufunkinaround it seems to me that youre ultimately negating the fact that mauna kea is an incredibly sacred mountain to many people of hawaii the ceremonies beliefs and spiritual practices can vary greatly like many things here in the islands families hƒÅlau and groups of all sorts are each dynamic and unique in their beliefs and how they honor and connect to the mauna there are many similarities but also differences that are honored more oft than not those spiritual practices are not shared openly

792	1	too neutral would be a way of describing it perhaps uninvolved might be another word you wrote in a way that didnt really identify you as native but rather a nonnative wanting us to justify our beliefs part of it i think is because there doesnt seem to be very many native atheists and you didnt use any kind of inclusive language with reference to yourself and your final comment about no disrespect definitely came across as referring to natives in general not just religious natives
793	1	it is reddit so i understand some people use downvotes to mean i dont like what youre saying no matter how you say iti can understand that mauna kea is sacred the article does state that there were spiritual practices related to the unobstructed view plane but it does not describe these practices so i was genuinely curious if people knew about these practices if theyre not shared openly i guess i can accept that but maybe i can see why a court would not if that is an issue herethe idea i was trying to express in my second question was if mauna kea is sacred certainly the net removal of two telescopes is a good thing i dont know anything about telescope construction but environmental impacts have been studied there will be fewer telescopes after this project is completed and there will be no more built in the future if the goal was to just remove two telescopes atop mauna kea do you think that would be as protested do you have opinions on this particular project
794	1	no problem the term pueblo comes from the spanish conquistadors that tried to colonize beginning around the 1600s or maybe it was the 1400s its a general word for town or village but each pueblo is its own tribe with their own indigenous word for themselves depending on the tribe they can share languages due to their close locations to each other all pueblos are technically located in new mexico one in arizona but i dont think they actually speak spanish although there may be some spanish influence in some words
795	1	yeah thanks he actually sent me that very same link going to watch it tonightedit it is cool but i wish they actually played more of the music by the bands they were documenting born of winter i dont konform mutilated tyrant

798	1	i see what happened to christianity as going from another faith involved in the antiroman crisis cult to being recuperated into the empire itself as one of the greatest betrayals in human history if only for the countless horrors that followed rome fell but it always found a way to decentralize itself i can only hope that the syncretic christianindigenous traditions that are spread throughout the world wont repeat the same mistakes that happened in the past but it seems unlikely
799	1	in the video he doesnt look so but we dont know the video was taken by a redditor who first posted it herehttpsnpredditcomrvisaliacommentsa3is6zmy_buddies_teacer_forcefully_cut_his_hairother articles mention the husband and students saying her personality abruptly changed a couple days before that sounds like a possible brain tumor or bad reaction to medication
800	1	i look so white that no one would think to label be as anything but irish people normally dont believe me until i show then pictures of me next to my grandfatherfather and when someone sees my grandfather they ask if he is samoan 99 of the time rather than accepting the maliseet label ive already presented
801	1	i imagine it wasnt a reservationwide decision the tribes of the time lacked central leadership unless under rare occasions such as red cloud or sitting bull     i speculate some crow would no doubt seek a reward by giving away chief joseph is plan to general sherman is forces

805	1	heck yeah buddy northern fry bread is meatier than navajo frybread in the north navajo style is considered like a sopapilla less dense and more flat
806	1	i just wanted to add that i know how difficult it is going from rez to rez like youve done  yah it is hard  but in a way along the wayyouve collected your own native community that yours  huh
807	1	yeah i hear that all the time meanwhile searching jine time only got me 11 instagram posts and one was a photo of someones gaming check lol
808	1	and he was incredibly disrespectful on multiple frontsim not arguing he is straight up insulting me making assumptions and fabricating strawmen points that i simply dont hold
809	1	absolutely easier to say than to do but we need to keep saying it in order for it to get donei feel you in terms of wanting to have actually competent teachers thats why it cant simply be about recruitment but also about identifying and getting good folks in the pipeline early for training to be teachers administrators etc it of course wont be just one thing that makes better representation happen but a key is that institutions put some actual time effort and resources into it
810	1	right now streaming free on primehttpswwwamazoncomrumbleindianswhorockedworlddpb075f9qbw1  and thank you very much for the heads up
811	1	i figured they are similar to bovine parents own a dairy farm and my dad always kept meticulous records of sires to cows to ensure a good supply of genetic diversity we have 100 head           of course we use artificial insemination which allows for genetic diversity which spans the breadth of the usa dont know how they handle their herds
812	1	some tribal communities have seen their crime double when big oil moves in then they dont have enough funding to keep up with all this new crime
813	1	wow thats quite a high recommendation
814	1	yeah that is totally what i meant lol
815	1	i cant and wont speak for other tribes but my ancestors resisted the puritans english religious zealots who attempted to humanize the savage their words not mine because they considered us uncivilized  over time we have married other native people due to slavery of some of our ancestors and being forced to live away from our traditional homelands  we have also married  outside our tribal nation as well that is all due to settler colonialism the french are part of east coast tribal history as well the abenaki of vermont and new hampshire interacted often with them as far as looking like we come from a particular tribe that is harder to say  if we are dressed in traditional clothing for a ceremonyor a cultural social event such as powwow that may help identify where regionally and even what tribe they are from
816	1	i fixed it sorry i do like the zucchini hunter tho
817	1	haha planning on it
818	1	very possible i never considered that it would make sense because my reservation is very religious so i can see some french religious footprints there
819	1	are you trying to suggest that stabbing people repeatedly is more moral im not gonna tell you i think execution is necessarily the best method of dealing with our problems but if youre claiming one kill is as good as another then that is a little bit debatable
820	1	first nation stylez
821	1	is there a polite way to response when another member is straight up trolling he is denying a claim made in the article headline and in the second paragraphi guess i should have omitted the youre boring part but calling him a troll was a statement of fact and that he would intentionally start arguments over whether the sky is blue and then report people that is top level trolling
822	1	downloading  thank you for the recommendation
823	1	how

828	1	wow dude you need to learn to take feedback everything he said was fair when you communicate with another person no matter the means you are going to convey a tone since this is an online forum it is conveyed through word choice there is also this weird instinct humans have to read messages through a negative lens sometimes you have to be overly happy when sending written communications unless your audience knows you i know you probably got some hate you dont deserve but we can avoid that with word choice it sucks to have to talk around some people but it is way easier than dealing with the hate source was a supervisor at a chat center i basically spent everyday trying to get my employees to understand that and also how to actually fix the customers problems
829	1	i appreciate the appeal to context but i dont necessarily believe his explanation more importantly there is still nothing voluntary about fleeing settler violence so his best efforts still fall well short of not being horrendously worded
830	1	all right will send when i get the chance
831	1	ahhhhhhhdelete and ignore that pm
832	1	i dont really share your unspoken assumptions so yeah i probably wasnt able to use them to interpret your comment

834	1	some of the more prominent cherokees that left where killed by there own people for not staying and helping fight for the land if i remember correctly
835	1	that is great news ill do some googling
836	1	i have a feeling that redditorbot is the kind of personbot who is too stupid to know that they dont know what theyre talking about
837	1	what a rude thing to say
838	1	i did and my comment was to address those that would take it as the tribes being the only reason that bison have come back which is not true
839	1	everybody told him that in the comments so he corrects himself in the annotations and in part 2
840	1	lol
841	1	hey i live in ohio which is pretty far from north carolina but ive tried to drive the 500 miles to make it home each year i know who i am and who my people are im not here to change your mind but i would still like to talk to you it is an incredibly shoddy documentary because this was the only way my cultural diversity professor im a cybersec student would let me out of class for a week without failing me she made me make a documentary on my tribe when leading up to a few days before i left it had been on the maori people but i do have a 34 min recorded interview with nancy strickland fields discussing the history of the lumbee tribe here its on my student account so youll have to pm me for the link the other videos in that playlist are also good the alisha interview is my least favorite i was incredibly unprepared edit pm me for link im also willing to answer any questions you have or i can ask someone in my tribe if i dont know the answer

844	1	r u ok
845	1	me too  this is the single greatest threat in our lives and the people in control dont seem to care  we all know it is coming how can political leaders all across the globe shrug it off  pardon my language earlier i am so angry at so many people about this topic
846	1	this isnt related to enrollment the headline is pretty bad the cherokee are already off of blood quantum for enrollment anyway arent they i thought they went by lineage
847	1	creepy just plain evil
848	1	alaska
849	1	just so yes that would probably go down as attempted assault with a deadly weapon for the box cutter threats and assault for cutting the hair of a person
850	1	that is interesting i know that historically the french were really into furtrapping and went further inland than the brits or the dutch and they were baptizing a lot of amerindians  maybe some of your ancestors were baptized by the french rather than getting the surname from a french greatgreatgreatgreatfather
851	1	thank you for your hearfelt reply it is very encouraging one problem is that i dont think my step brother was ever enrolled with his tribe so i dont know what kind of limitations that sets for him he is always said something like his dad signed an agreement keeping my brother out of the tribe but im not sure what that means it seems a bit strange i worry too that it might be painful for him as well to explore his heritage specifically because i think his native heritage is something he thinks of as his father is and there is a lot of pain associated with the memory of his father who left him when he was very young his grandmother stepped in and basically took over the roll that her son my step brother is dad left behind it is complex i need to talk to him more about it i thinkthanks very much for sharing your experience
852	1	oh thanks so much ughostlonefight  for sharing your experience words of wisdom amp practical native advice  i really appreciate your post amp contributions amp i hope others may benefit from your wordsimho younger native folks shouldnt be so concerned about the way they look on the outside wrt looking ndn whatever that means or looking like a white or a black person  so much as the way they actin my experience regardless of what someone looks like if you are sincere in your heart not looking to take selfish advantage amp have patience listen amp are willing to learn if you show gratitude etc i think eventually being accepted as part of the ndn community by others will naturally unfold in a heartfelt way  i dont know how to explain it but there is an ndn senseennitwowthe jacket youre making is so awesome of an idea  way cooltotally sweet  i hope you will share a pic of it here  good luck in finishing it

859	1	gt esp at my employer tribe where to hold elected office a citizen has to be of 14 or more blood quantumthats kind of funny since you can have 14 blood quantum and look completely white
860	1	no this is not about tribal membership its about restricted land owners to keep the land on restricted status the owner had to be at least 12 under the stigler act now there is no blood quantum minimum to own the land in restricted status when previously a less than 12 heir taking the property in probate would cause the land to fall out of restricted status into fee statusedit and creek nation recognizes membership based on lineal descendants from the dawes roll the only blood quantum requirement they have is a citizen must be 14 or more to run for tribal office
861	1	youre literally defending trolling wowill take your suggestion and participate elsewhere it is a shame to remove rindiancountry from my list but youre pretty messed up for defending overt trolling
862	1	theyre part of the southwestern culture group of american indians
863	1	damn im writing that down
864	1	wasnt necessarily the flair part many of our community members here who are native dont have their flairs set and stating your tribebq isnt necessary either though you can if you choose to it was mainly the wording of your question that stood out and was misinterpreted at least by me cant speak for others
865	1	okay mildly offended by that if i had to guess id say you were attempting to justify a particular kill on some grounds you didnt elaborate on which is not normal it is kinda bad actually
866	1	okay will do thank you

868	1	also would this law change anything for natives who live in urban settings over 75 of aian live in urban areas
869	1	your dad is recipe sounds like a fine crepe perfect
870	1	im glad you spoke up the way you did native people are far from being some kind a monolithic singular entity who are here to serve the interestspurposes of others  im more shy though about telling other folks what they should dowhat would be best for them to do a respected traditional spiritual leader who is choctaw amp chickasaw amp who is a friend of our family told me once that as near as he could tell there is not just one right way in life  but there are many right ways with regard to spirituality religion and in making one is path through life

881	1	you legit made gasp and hopetake your upvote and gosighs
882	1	no this prevents land from further being removed from restricted status due to transfer after probate to heirs with a lower blood quantumrestricted status means the property has significantly greater protections than fee land and is subject to regulation not only by the bia but the tribal jurisdiction as well
883	1	youre not the only nonnative here but youre the only one copping an attitude like that why do you need to correct people about fry bread why cant you just enjoy learning about it
884	1	here is my favorite fry bread one requires some cooling of the dough httpswwwallrecipescomrecipe7174navajofrybreadihttpswwwallrecipescomrecipe7174navajofrybreadi
885	1	you sound more and more foolish everytime you reply you should just stop by the way i saw this comment before you edited it or deleted it before posting this one who knows what was it you said no you diluted natives just piss me offyoure the only angry person on this thread and youre acting like a child
886	1	i have zero idea what jine is from but indian time is as widespread as frybread and indian tacos
887	1	that was my take as well albuquerque of all places that is why im leaning towards some kinda mental break  it is just so extreme otherwise i cant pretend to know what runs through the head of someone who hates other people just for who they are as opposed to things theyve done so i may be assigning too much logic to something that really defies it but it seems to me like if someone had some kinda bone to pick with native kids thered be other ways to make things hard for them without showing her ass i suppose im just baffled at what she thought she was gonna accomplishthe reaction of the school board chair isnt surprising  those folks are notoriously shortsighted when it comes to the human aspect of schools so that isnt really a commentary on some sort of innate bias against native kids so much as an innate bias against humanity as a whole but it is a little more salt on the wound for sureedit going outside must be some strange form of torture made me laugh really hard so thank you for that
888	1	yup this man sexually abused first nations women in the community i grew up in
889	1	recipes evolve
890	1	i agree watching it was hypnotic for me it was a film where i was so completely drawn in by the cinematographythose beautiful long takes for one and the actions happening on screen but when i recommend it to someone and they ask for the plot the best i come up with is uh its about this one woman its like about her life
891	1	good looking list thanks so much
892	1	was it too neutrali try to be matteroffact as possible when posing questions so i can avoid confusioni didnt want to speak as if i represented anyone but myself
893	1	i suppose i should clarify in that sense what i mean was that it was an official beginning for the government to take a stance on how to handle things   proselytization and missionaries were around long before that as well  if there is something that comes before it for the indigenous in the us im not sure what it would be  there might be up to this point i thought it was mostly treaties being brokered and reneged on
894	1	it would be great if the us wasnt saying it in their latest effort to further diminish tribal governments
895	1	the warrior nation and bear clan are some really really badass names my tribe is name agikuyukikuyu means people of the large sycamore tree which sounds a little less intimidating my kikuyu name can be translated as silent warrior which is quite badass though

905	1	hmm im not sure actually it wouldnt be his tribe though does that matter

910	1	theyre not theyre giving the tribes more freedom in deciding who is or isnt a member the blood quantum was the feds telling the tribes who they could or couldnt admit and that is done now

914	1	wow great post
915	1	my impression from your tone was more aggressivegtit makes no sense to me that any native who is proud of their heritage and culture would then go and prayworship such a foreign deity i could say the same of your self proclaimed nonspiritual beliefs that is  it makes no sense to me that any native who is proud of their heritage amp culture would then go and not pray every day and would describe themselves as an atheist  that would be respectful of me  i dont know you amp dont know what kind of person amp what kind of ndn you are  as ive gotten older ive found there are a lot of different kind of natives  whether you are ndn or nonnative it is not for me to convince you or anyone else    in my experience spirituality is very personal  there are also some things that shouldnt be talked about in public perhaps the most evil part of colonization is that you have been disconnected from any kind of spirituality  i have pity for you

930	1	a normal person could
931	1	for example my grandma was cherokee from three of her grandparents all mixed cherokee and choctaw mixed from her fourth grandparent but on the dawes rolls they didnt get into complicated fractions they just focused on one line of descent and said she was 18th but in fact she was 18th just from that line but they ignored the other lines and bypassed the choctaw altogether
932	1	i believe that dna tests are 999 reliable also that high amount 25 is something im doing to dismiss its who i am ill be doing a thorough investigation upon my findings im also doing a ancestry tree
933	1	im pretty sure its ojibwe for rabbit i dont have a clan animal as it isnt a m√©tis practice but all of my friends did since i was the shortest they started calling me wabooz and it stuckedit i should mention the animal nicknames were popular in our group still call one of the guys mooz
934	1	miigwech for sharing i work at a school for native children and we offer ojibwe oneida and menominee language classes every day to our students
935	1	i really wish they had malinda maynor lowry was mentioned a lot in the article and she is my aunt so any complaints or questions that i didnt know how to respond to i could relay directly to her
936	1	i kinda know this but i rarely take pictures right now mostly since my phones cam sucks and i dont carry a decent camera with me
937	1	sorry non native
938	1	interesting im really not that familiar with the history of the pacific northwest
939	1	do you find that you look more white than native were they understandingmy band is right on the canadian border and my father is about that age it is always freaked me out to think that that could have been him
940	1	thank you for this insight i did not even see it from this angle
941	1	the question posed was simply how did this happeni dont think it matters who is asking that questionbut whatever being a dick to other redditors on this sub is fine as long as it is perceived to be directed at da evil white manz outsider rules dont mean shit it seems
942	1	you didnt ask a question you stated your position and asked how anyone could disagree
943	1	michigander here the anishinaabe kill it at the three fires pow wow
944	1	fuck thats good
945	1	i want to give her the benefit of the doubt and say probably some type of mental illness but i do think the big orange baby getting elected has made racist people feel like they have a license to  express their bigotry
946	1	thanks im all for people being woke about native history and all but i dont like seeing our ancestors gruesome corpses thrown around the internet
947	1	had no idea she was part cherokee but to answer your question i dont think she was in the doc
948	1	it was a haka  many of the cast was maori and one was written by maori specifically for this
949	1	not exactly but still helpful and informative thank you
950	1	my recollection is that it was he that was a quarter because his grandma was full i might be mistaken but that is how i remember the movie it stuck out with me because while im an enrolled citizen of the cherokee nation im only technically 164th though that is baloney because the dawes roll seemed to call anyone who didnt appear full native as 18 and my brother is geneology work shows she was clearly about 80 or so cherokee i remember thinking damn hendrix is way more real cherokee than me
951	1	does it mention tori amos ive always wondered if she is popular among native americans considering the big influence her heritage eastern cherokee has on the content of her songsedit watched the trailer and it seems to be more about past influences
952	1	i think since columbus set foot on hispaniola natives have been mistreated and their culture has been wiped out the aztec and maya writing systems extremely intuitive creations knowledge was wiped off the face of the earth from the southern tip of south america to greenland natives have suffered i come here to learn about and interact with native americans because of my interest in them
953	1	wasnt me
954	1	sorry but your comment has been removed for violating rule 4httpswwwredditcomrindiancountryaboutrules please read the rules while youre here
955	1	in chile too there are many quechua words that have influenced chilean spanish as well as mapudungun
956	1	cool ill see if they have it near me
957	1	i dont think nagle was referring to cherokee nation since they dont have any minimum bq  by logic when a tribenation has no bq theres no way someone can have less than ¬Ω bq  so today the enrolled cherokee citizens who possess 18192th blood can have children who have 116384thousandths amp grandchildren with 132768thousands etc all of whom are eligible for cn enrollment   i thought ms nagle was referring to the other additional 100 tribes that were also subjected to allotment amp have decided it is in their best interests to maintain a minimum bq  with 100 tribes theres sure to be a bunch of differing membership requirements some wdiffering degrees of minimum tribal bq some who count other tribes ndn blood amp some wmandatory reservation residency requirements for enrollment etc  like i know ukb cherokee has a minimum bq but idk if they also suffer from allotment policy   honestly i dont think nagle was advocating for any kind of particular standard or way to determine tribal eligibility  my sense from her background familiarity wndn ways amp her other eloquent writing she is too ndn savvy to do that rather she was acknowledging the actual real situations that exist win tribes who still maintain a bq  the subsequent amp continued fractionalizationfractionation of tribal land has created a situation where nontribal members have inherited ownership control to sell to a nonnative  this is a problem
958	1	so you were born andor grew up on a reservation in my case i dont think our land is technically a reservation but either way you slice it i was only there once after being born and another time for my great grandmother is funeral i couldnt have been more than ten at the time either on one hand i wish id have had that experience on the other ive heard that fair skinned children have it rough on and off the rez
959	1	yeah thats my experience with indian time too we use it teasingly but in a goodnatured way one of my cousins found a tshirt that says appropriately she runs on indian time jine time has got to be regional or at least uncommon
960	1	yeah theyre replaced with tomatoes after being stupid enough to think that tomatoes were poisonous because they didnt listen when native americans told them how to grow and eat them talk about a superiority complex
961	1	dont panic weve got bannock
962	1	yeah they just electrocute poison them after decades of torture and abuse
963	1	that is unfortunate but interesting
964	1	you dont know what youre talking about do you
965	1	thank you im going to have to keep them in mind for the future
966	1	holy wow thats a lot of merch
967	1	ahh i open all new links in tabs i had a tab this morning showing a photo of a proud zucchini hunter i had no idea what id clicked on to get it
968	1	from what i read of the senate version the bill gives tribal cops access to the federal criminal databases a token gesture at increasing funding and encourages all states and local agencies to develop best practices guidelines to encourage interagency cooperation nothing about the guidelines is mandatory which is probably why it passed the republicancontrolled senate so easily however it is a start and most police officers dont like being thought of as easy on crime so cooperation will probably increase
969	1	cool bit too much og fry bread is flour and lard cant really go wrong
970	1	i love plains cree bannock done over a fire and wrapped around a stick but ive yet to have bad bannock
971	1	of course your questions are valid you received a number of other responses that were more tactful regardless youre free to feel how you want i was just explaining why some might react the way bob did
972	1	wow ive never thought to do that im going to try this next time i make some
973	1	are the navajo originally from a warmer region or do you think they had less admixture with europeans than the ojibwe
974	1	japanese people have been oppressed too america put them in interment camps during wwii they also have a bloody history mostly warring with each other every culture is different every culture was oppressed one way or another the jewish population is probably the biggest they have been beaten down for over 2000 years  i mean it was so bad even the bible says they wandered the desert for 40 years when they escaped slavory from the egyptions  im calling it as it is we put natives on a pedestal when honestly we all make our own destiny in this new world the drug problems the medical care the jobless its our personal problems if you dont want to live like that then go on to greener pastures becuase it is better when you acclimate outside of the rez im not saying forget your heritage im saying better yourself to continue your heritage
975	1	life isnt fair mate toughen up
976	1	people often under reported their children is blood quantums to give them more opportunities under racist laws
977	1	the article doesnt say that and even notes other actors involved in the resurgence
978	1	the more photos you take the more you realize how horribly wrong it can go lol
979	1	this is primarily focused on tribal lands  there are some truly galling loopholes that have led to major problems for prosecuting assault on the res and that is more of the dynamic this specific bill addresses
980	1	he is fine you came here asking questions even if someone got your position wrong you should be here to listen not argue
981	1	yes yes i am i forgot to set my flair doesnt mean i should be treated like a piece of shit my questions were valid
982	1	youve missed the point completely
983	1	but navajos use bluebird flour which is white flour
984	1	im curious where op got their conclusion from
985	1	excellentedit oops i did a goof
986	1	easy to say harder to do my mind goes back to highschool where we had two native teachers for all us rez kids to cycle through not only were these two bozos incompetent they would derail our learning and turn every lesson into rants about their home life   im all for native representation but i have yet to see it done competently it becomes a number they have to fill and anyone who actually had experience with these programs i guarantee you will say the same
987	1	thanks for the reply ive offered all that id like to share with you on a personal level ufunkinaround if youre interested in reading watching some articles videos on the topic that may offer more insight i have a few for you to peruse
988	1	im a pro photog and it is true for me
989	1	watch it in a theater the director plays around with cinematic devices that only make sense if youre in a movie theatre
990	1	thank youso the 14 portion of her piece was meant to address the issues of inheritance as related to bq without taking on the issue of bqinteresting dance very easy to step on the toes of sovereignty albeit its dark side
991	1	if you lived in vancouver i would say go to their physical store because they have a monthlong december sale going on right now
992	1	redheaded cherokee here too i work in tribal gov for another tribe and def feel the different treatment from not being native enough esp at my employer tribe where to hold elected office a citizen has to be of 14 or more blood quantum it results in an overt two tiered classification of citizens rather than some of the covert discrimination like accusations of not being culturally connected enough when being considered for certain positions it happened to shawna baker who is a very qualified attorney when she was being considered for the cherokee nation supreme courtshe was condemned for no cherokee background personally or professionally despite her incredible qualifications having two llms columbia and nyu in addition to her jd u of tulsa as well as experience as a law professor and a practicing attorney it sucks when your tribe says it wants to encourage its citizens to be educated and then come back and work for the tribe but then essentially tell you you arent cherokee enough building capacity is important and qualified candidates who are interested in service shouldnt be turned away
993	1	excellent my thanks
994	1	9999 reliable if you are completely white if you have non white they wont be im not saying to completely dismiss that 25 im saying it may not be native and it could be something else miscalculated european east asian west asian or central asian are all possibilities so dont in expecting a full blood grandparent dna test might be right or it might not be with native dna its often wrong or incorrect id say 75 of the time so you can never be sure until you have concrete paperwork backing it up
995	1	some quality rgatekeeping here
996	1	the tribe had a death penalty for tribal members who ceded tribal land to the us when the ridge signed the treat of new echota he reputedly said i have signed my death warrant the individuals who signed that treaty in accordance with the law morehttpsgeorgiainfogalileousgeduthisdaygahistory0622threeassasinatedfortreatyofnewechota
997	1	so then youre just full of shit understood by the way it looks like im winning in the vote arena
998	1	it shouldnt matter because those are intertribal spaces where anyone is welcome as long as they are respectful there is a lot of intertribal culture that has developed because so many of us are displaced from our tribal lands and nations
999	1	it depends on how different reindeer dna is compared to humans i know 100 people is not enough for long term genetic diversity will reindeer dna be effected the same i honestly dont know
1000	1	oh yeah that is tough like in general prejudice is the last thing you need up there
1001	1	i was actually surprised to see this article because it had been so hard to find reliable sources about that time period and the theft of that pole in particular thank you for sharing
1002	1	thanks for the heads up
1003	1	fuck that guy  everyone should be willing to sanction brasil if they dont step up their conservation game
1004	1	til canada is still in the dark ages
1005	1	thank you very much for the recommendations i think selfdetermination is a good word for it
1006	1	im deeply worried that were going to see mass deforestation and genocide in the near future and then the destruction of the rainforest leading to a lot of runaway ecological problems across and beyond the continent years later with a lot of people throwing up their hands and saying who could have seen this coming
1007	1	i changed it to public thanks for inquiring
1008	1	the downvote i just dropped you should suffice
1009	1	i listen to both soundtracks regularly so great
1010	1	raproprosofnothing or rnotrelatedbut would probably become one of the default subs
1011	1	because native americans had their families separated until the american indian welfare act was passed and a large majority of the immigrant children were placed in foster care
1012	1	youre funny
1013	1	seems like this gives tribes more not less autonomy am i wrong
1014	1	i wondered why you wanted to know tooin all due respect these 2 situations are not the same at allfor a fair comparison you would need to go back to whatever country of origin these immigrant children are coming from amp find out what their country is govt is doing wrt a systematic policy of separation of children from their parents amp tribe if they belong to one to destroy tribalindigenous cohesive unity by raising little ones outside of their cultural traditional tribal ways of lifethere is a huge difference between the voluntary individual personal choice made by the parents of immigrant children vs the assault onattempted destruction of the tribal sovereignty amp future survival of us federally recognized american indian tribes amp their enrolled members as derived by their legal amp political status which the icwa was enacted to combatcorrect

1016	1	gt wasicuwhat is the etymology of that like the two terms i know from puyallup past…ôd and yakama pasht…®n are derived from boston where white guys that originally visited said they were fromim pretty sure it went from yakama to puget sound tribes because ichishk√≠in s…®nwit the yakama language doesnt have a b so words in english with b is are instead pronounced with p isboston turns into pasht…®nthen yakama tribesmen visit their cousins in the sound and told them that the white guys that dropped by are from pasht…®nin x ∑…ôlsucid language of most puget sound tribes and does have b n and d are commonly switched around so pasht…®n would eventually evolve into past…ôd
1017	1	great informative post thanks for taking the time to do this
1018	1	gtit started here   gt  gthttpsenwikipediaorgwikiindian_removal_acti really dont think sowhat ill say is that efforts to christianize natives started a long time before that at least wmy tribe  according to catholic records the 1st jesuit mission they established in our parts was in 1673  the black robes as they were called in the old days didnt have many converts at firstor for a whileit just depends on the personal choices made by natives  also some of us stayed traditional at least in my tribe amp family  then in the late 1840 is50s i know the us govt asked both the hochunk amp the menominee to let volunteers who freely wanted to personally relocate their families from the oneida tribe of ny and to allow them be our neighbors amp cede them some of our land to live on  these christians that broke away became known as oneida tribe of wisconsin which is totally separate from ny oneidas  i mention this because history is a little more complicated than you summarized above
1019	1	care to voice or link to someof them
1020	1	yes i call it bannock all the time
1021	1	i have never heard of the pueblo before so thank you for the info i find it interesting that they have a spanish name people i think do they call themselves pueblo or do they use indigenous names and since they have spanish names is spanish a commonly spoken language amongst the pueblo in the us
1022	1	cool is she the main character i know nothing about this show
1023	1	rome fell not once but multiple timesthe roman catholic church is going through a severe crisis and is the religion experiencing the fastest decline
1024	1	thats really interesting i never really thought about that type of connection before but it does make sense
1025	1	maybe read the article instead of being pendantic
1026	1	in that case let me recommend that you speak humbly  with an attitude to learn your comments here came across as combative as if you knew the right answer and wanted to correct people if youre trying to learn about native peoples that is not a helpful attitude indigenous people have had their food systems violently ripped away from them in response weve taken the ingredients of colonizers and created our own techniques and dishes that use what we had fry bread is a staple throughout indian country and isnt a staple for any other culture it is definitely part of our food tradition for better or for worse
1027	1	youre right it could i have mixed feelings about this but the reality is more folks are mixed and the dawes rolls arent accurate about blood quantum
1028	1	i understand thank you so much
1029	1	you think the inuit hunt for profit lmaooooo
1030	1	boozhoo
1031	1	oh youre a troll it says it twice by the time you reach the second paragraph youre boring
1032	1	while i do enjoy both zucchini and cats i do believe you linked the wrong thing
1033	1	sure thing
1034	1	this is a great idea
1035	1	and be merry while surrounded by loved ones during a generally festive time of the year some that dont no exactly how bad this day was tough month
1036	1	maybe both they are typically in the south western region so it is possible that may be part of it but i also have a french last name even though my entire family comes from the reservation so it is possible way back when there was some mixing but id imagine that is also true with navajo
1037	1	read the rules please
1038	1	is their culture related to mesoamericans or are they more similar to the american native people in arizonanew mexico
1039	1	my grandmother used to make something like this as a treat for my brother and i when we were kids were not native though i do admire the culture amp plan to make some fry bread this weekend
1040	1	whose culture sorry i got confused
1041	1	thats horrid
1042	1	damn jimi was 5050 thats a damn shame really reminds me of the still pervasive racism against my black brothers and sisters out there with real native ancestry
1043	1	so i usually dont comment amp wade into the water rebq amp tribal enrollment because i honestly dont know what is the best way for my tribe to figure out membership never mind anyone else is tribe  i just try the best i can to be a good tribal memberperson    i understand your 1st amp 3rd points  i dont understand 2 from a traditional standpoint i think that is the dominant society imposing their ways on us amp making us conform  from another post re mashpee you talked about this being a new termination era i cant put a name to what is going onbut it seems to me it is more of an allpervasive legal combatassault on tribal sovereignty on all levels to further destroy us amp the native tribal spirit that lives within us mostly from the rightwing but also from both demrep governed us state govts amp from congress amp sadly in some cases were doing it to ourselveswith infighting amp by people who dont live by traditional culturalspiritual values  this manifests itself with legal assaults on icwa to hurtful culverts amp twisted interpretations of treaty words to what now means to determining tribal membership amp disenrollment  i could go on amp on    i can only speak for my tribe  traditionally tribal membership wasnt at all fair or equal it was subjective  the foreign legal construct of entitled individual rights doesnt apply to the kinship bonds of belonging amp tribal unity  an individual is behavior determined that  basically if folks in 1 of our bands thought you were good enough to be part of us you were  period  and then you were accepted as a sign of respect by the rest of the bandstribe as such  the blood that anyone happened to be born into this life has nothing to do with what i am talking about
1044	1	was born off the reserve grew up on the rezand i can attest to having it rough growing up on the rez with white skin as well as being exposed to more racism off the reserve racism on the reserve is a little more subtle whereas in the city its definitely more blatant i continue paying the price for being white skinned native but it is a lot easier to blend in off the reserve i almost feel like an anomaly
1045	1	makes sense anybody who loves fringe like jimi hendrix did has got to be native
1046	1	not bad it is been a pretty good year for me overall been working at a job making furniture writing a short story practicing my drawing skills more frequently working on my fitness a little bit overall feeling better about myself than i have for a whilehow about you man
1047	1	because southern italian cuisine replaced mushroom sauce with tomato sauce there is a difference between adding a few new things to a cuisine as opposed to having a distinctly native american dish with zero native ingredients
1048	1	lol what a big baby you shouldnt trust iffy sites with the word atlantis in it otherwise just link me some ancient aliens episodesso what was i supposed to be correcting you on anyway
1049	1	the samoan guy looked like a big south east asian guy with a shaved head dont know what hes doing now hawaiians tend to look either filipino or native chamorros are like smaller hawaiians with slightly more australoid admixture
1050	1	thank you  this seems to be the consensus  i can now go back to my fb friend and shame him publicly
1051	1	blood quantum is something that was established by the federal government tribes need to break away from that otherwise theyll blood quantum themselves into extinction
1052	1	i thought caral in peru was older than the ancient egyptian architecture
1053	1	so a white or black tribe can admit who they want
1054	1	ah youve noticed the pattern and are slowly waking up that is good yeah there is an actual site where they skinheaditup it is called stormfront here is one example that was made by kennewick man himself back in 2004 hehe you should read the entire thing httpswwwstormfrontorgforumt167376  apparently the first people anywhere is supposed to mean something that is why i cant believe the irony of their comments compared with the recent genetic reports over the past 4 or 5 years  i would make a longer post but i just got home and am pretty tired here is some links though compare their beliefs with what these links say and have a good laugh  httpwwwsciencedailycomreleases201401140126134643htm  httpwwwbbccomnewsscienceenvironment25885519  httpnewssciencemagorgarchaeology201411europeangeneticidentitymaystretchback36000years  httpwwwashgorg2014meetingabstractsfulltextf140121091htm  httpwwwjesusoxacuksitesdefaultfilesreichseminar2015pdf  httpwwwbbccomnewsscienceenvironment34175224  httpbiorxivorgcontentearly20150210013433  all this has important implications too for the whole antiimmigration nonsense  edit btw you should begin to take screenshots of the posts like that that you read over and over again theyll come in handy at some point in the future to take a screenshot press that print screen button bring up paint then paste the screenshot onto the blank page then crop out whatever you want
1055	1	youve missed the point but to address this question yes it is culturally inauthentic and the subjects just did as they were told he is looked at negatively by many natives
1056	1	another historically interesting quote is teddy roosevelt is 1886 comments about sand creeksand creek was no aberration it was us policy then to kill women and children to accept no survivors and to attack even if our families were unarmed and provided no resistance another battle tested intentional tactic by both the american and mexican armies was to hit the camps when the men were gone and slaughter their families this was considered a dishonorable way to fight but the us still uses this technique in places like japan and vietnam it is a standard way they fight where by fight i mean cowardly slaughter people a third proven effective tactic was to wait until we were moving camp the men would be at the front and back the americans would attack from the sides and start by killing the women and children the men would then run to protect their families dispersing them and making them less effective at defense
1057	1	i meant as they are indigenous americans not by their looks also we are all almond eyed brown peoples if that counts for anything plus im glad to say the chamorus are finally gaining their size back a bit back before the euros the chamorus were huge many of them were 6 before the 1700 is and massively built my younger bro is 61 and built like a brick house and i see more younger people getting taller as well
1058	1	sure no problem i saw a picture of someone in your posts and that person looked to have significant indian blood to me i wasnt totally sure if it was you or not either way i suspect you wouldnt be spending all this time in mexico and columbia if not and the situation with your grandfather pay attention to dreams if you are brown and thus look indian people are going to be more open dont forget to look around in mexico as well wherever your family lines are from sometimes things just happen
1059	1	well it sounds like youre at the beginning of a great adventure thanks for sharing
1060	1	looks to me like most of the comments were trash anyway racists all over the place they dont know shit about reservations either
1061	1	hey thanks for replying to my post sadly yes my parents are mexican but they are of mostly european decent   i always strongly felt there was some indigenous in me until i asked not too long ago perhaps in a past life my grandfather only stumbled upon them on a trek once decades ago when he was looking for work in the states however that doesnt stop my deep soulful connection with the indigenous people of our land one bit my dream is to be an artist and i feel that their influence on me will base the structure of it all i am heading to phoenix this saturday though i have no idea where to start other than the city of guadalupe which a kind redditor recommended to me hopefully it works out any other recommendations will help out too or even any advice on how to approach the situation in general i dont wish to come off wrong about what i am trying to accomplish and wish to do so in the most respectful manner possible thank you so much for looking out
1062	1	the indigenous experience between canus natives is like night and day im assuming youre from the us you guys are on your own down there the reason i keepkept bringing up demographics so much is because it reveals to you what can or cannot be done in a way it is like being able to see in the future  most of the bad comments up here come from older whites and the generations younger than them are actually quite sane in comparison were also dealing with a much smaller population too like literally only 10 the size of the us the white population is quite old and the fn population is very young eight of ten fns live in on mb sk and bc and will make up a larger percentage of the provinces population from here on there are already quite a few ridingselectoral districts where fns make up a large share of the areas population so basically what is going to happen is that all this colonialism that people currently dont know exists will be gradually abolished once people start to figure out that it actually exists the infighting among nonfn people is already starting it is fun to watch it is not as easy as people think though when you begin to get rid of some of these things you begin to affect the rights of all citizens which is interesting
1063	1	do you ever notice that when there are articles about native americans on reddit on one of the defaults that is there is always someone talking about how we replaced the actual first americans ive seen this a lot and i wonder where this shit comes from i know the solutrean hypothesis is out there but how could anyone who is read about it not also have read that it is thoroughly debunked or is there some white power resource online that collects all that kind of bs for activists to disseminate i wonder about it
1064	1	so an ounce of indigenous blood makes the whole person indigenous
1065	1	you know nothing about caral got it
1066	1	the samoan could be seen as a native american as well similar to hawaiians and chamorus
1067	1	your last paragraph nails it we are clueless
1068	1	so does that make the things shown inauthentic and fake
1069	1	correct you on what exactly the only caral thing ive seen is some hourlong video on youtube and a few pictures of it it is just a platform basically no massive walls made of chiseled stone no columns no pillars no statues etc same thing with that mohenjo daro place just a platform with some mud brick walls and houses built on it
1070	1	my experiences have been the same it is really disappointing to spend so much time educating people even after years of struggle if they eventually become convinced there really was a holocaust and we really arent savages the last maneuver is a familiar one they just smile and say well they never did any of those bad things and that was long ago never mind it was not long ago and is still going on and they are still benefiting from the crimes of their ancestorsi agree we need to look to solve our own problems the white man is not going to save our culture he transitions neatly from smothering our culture by taking our children away to coopting our culture with falsehoods to claims that our culture is his culture and he dictates its scope and determines to what extent we will be allowed to practice it and whether he will determine us to be authentic the problem is that there is no call for him to have any power in any of this at any point of this we must teach our children we must save our languages and cultures if we are unwilling to no one else will do it for us
1071	1	gt white europeans i am a descendent particularly the uk france germany and italy underwent a bloodthirsty continental genocide under the euphemism of colonialism it really is amazing the lies us white people use to gloss over terrible terrible atrocitiesare you familiar with john trudell  here is a video of him talking where he suggests everyone of european ancestry to study their tribal ancestry and learn how they became civilized   httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvghpyevzoz4
1072	1	i think it would be a great place to do it but reddit is filters will see that you votedcommented in a thread linked to from another subreddit and ban you for brigading even if youre just trying to educate
1073	1	take a look at ictm online version and you can readily see the white or black tribes i am not going to get specific for you due to the oversensitivity of this subjectit is obvious many members readers are mixed heavily or not indigenous at all the wannabe syndrome again and again
1074	1	that is what i thought but i didnt want to believe someone would be so ignorant
1075	1	i agree with what you have said here many good pointssometimes people make the argument that all the bad things are long in the past this is not true though reading the comments section on any english media in the us or canada about any indigenous issues usually contains mostly antiindigenous comments arguing against them with evidence and such seems fairly futile based on experience doing so as they outnumber indigenous 100 to 1 and can simple shut indigenous viewpoints down while chanting democracy
1076	1	huh not sure i understand what youre saying wouldnt this be the perfect thread for natives andor knowledgeable nonnatives to be posting on that is sort of why i wanted to share it here
1077	1	this one apparently would be my answer i think what can i do to help and will it really help to see change in my own life time i dont want to sit on ifs policy changes genetic ressurection that might change things down the line maybe but do something meaningful now the worst things ive witnessed is someone is misguided attempts to help someone else only to have an opposite effect or worse erase their individuality one on one helping another i can avoid such an outcome but i have no idea if thats enough to affect long term outcomes positively or even what to do in this case i wont resort to violent and extreme methods i just want to help heal others as i can and i had no idea untill yesterday that it was this badextensive here and this is an antiquated corrupt government i happened to have been born on the soil of and labled citzen forin a world that touts justice but does not contain any
1078	1	thanks i agree that picking a random indian to play dress up with another tribe is clothing is some serious fake stuff it is done in movies now of course where the native actors are seldom from the tribe depicted in the script but that is clearly presented as fictional representation and is differentthe cases i have seen with curtis is he would take the photo from an angle not showing the car sitting off to the side he would remove western technology like clocks from tipis or remove them from the photo afterwords however the photos from his encyclopedia are clearly portraits the people are often staring at the camera and not candid documentary snapshots even when we see candid documentary snapshots these days on national geographic and discovery shows about indigenous people these are also generally staged managed by or even reenacted for the photographer as well so it is a common practicei dont agree though that this by itself makes the things inauthentic or wrong details shown may be correct or incorrect separate from this issue of staging and posing it is interesting and instructive that that reasoning is only used to claim inauthenticity for nonwhites that argument is not used to argue against authenticity of similarly staged photos of white people like at sears studio or vacation snapshots where people are reenacting catching the fish or whatever just happened no one says oh that is not what that family really looks like the photographer is a joke and a con artist this photo does not document the way these people are assuming we can even trust they are really white people at all maybe they are chinese people dressed as white people no no one argues that for white peoplebut yes for any shots where the person is wearing stuff from another tribe pretending to be from another tribe or wearing things that the photographer put together based on his own ideas that would be fakefor a lot of us curtis took the best pictures we have of our people and weve heard the stories and the people were wearing their own clothes that they actually wore and doing things that they actually did now in some cases it was reenacted somewhat the person now wore western clothes but had his old clothes stored somewhere and got up so that there would be a photograph documenting what he actually used to look like before being forced to dress like a white man some of those not allowed to wear their traditional normal clothes saw this as a good opportunity for future generations to see the actual clothes and even paint put on properlycurtis big project of which these photos were a part is incredible work if your tribe has a section you know that he documented all sorts of things in amazing detail including things he should not have seen or documented he was pretty sneaky and was open about it in his writings and he was speaking from a white viewpoint but it is amazing material and the best stuff from that era he documents things in their actual words and when we know the language it is well done by a linguist and not the low quality indian agency phonetics found on rolls where you cant even tell what the words are supposed to be because it is so butchered this is preipa and so it is not perfect but he carefully lays out the orthography and pronunciation something rare to find then in a work it is amazing quality for the time and the best there is from that period sometimes his is the only documentation of lost words because he is the only person that ever bothered to ask about certain thingsdismissing his work as that of a crank or fake stuff is like saying that j p harrington is work is fakenobody is work is perfect but curtis and harrington both went deep and produced very high quality documentation people attack it and dismiss it like it is nothing and it is fake and that is not correctnow if there is some photos with people dressed in fake clothing that curtis made them wear and it is all wrong yeah let is refer to that by volume and page number and sort out those cases but it is certainly not the majority of the photographsalso there are some cases of photos around not necessarily curtis with the wrong dress because you had really weird stuff where tons of tribes like the cherokees were dressing in full plains get up in the style of a lakota because that is what tourists wanted to see and tourists didnt consider actual real traditional cherokee clothing as what the tourist thought of as authentic now that is a real problem and even today there is tons of nonplains tribes where some people put on plains clothing that is strange but it is something the native chooses for whatever reason and not something caused by the photographer consider also the really weird situation with mary fallin putting on what is called an authentic plains headdress that she found in the gift shop at the chickasaw casino and race track and indeed there is photos of chickasaw politicians wearing headdresses like that and they are selling them in their gift shop and guess what chickasaws are not plains indians they are village mound people from mississippi and tennessee that is not their actual dress at all it is not even close why are so many cherokees and chickasaws and other indians still pretending to be lakotas or comanches it makes no sense at all let is talk about the inauthenticity of this nonsense some time people blame that white girl for putting on a head dress why is it being sold in a gift shop by the wrong tribe who is claiming it is their dress that is the real question to ask rather than complain about the silly white girl putting it on well at least she has good taste it was a very nice head dresscurtis did good work all the anthro stuff from that period and most anthro stuff up to the present is biased inaccurate and has huge problems but curtis work is actually pretty damn good and it is scary how observant he was and much stuff he saw that he shouldnt have seen but it happened it is out there and it is not a terrible work it puts us in a good light most of the time unlike a lot of other western academics out trying to prove to themselves that we were inhuman savagesall documentation has errors and problems it makes sense to document specific errors and note problems especially with works from previous eras that always have bias but these errors do not mean the entire work is a joke or can be dismissed some works are totally fake nonsense like books white people like cooper and karl may would publish about indians and even several first hand accounts were written by white people pretending to be indians you can spot these if you are familiar with the culture because all the details are wrongcurtis work is not like this he doesnt always describe things right but it is absolutely the case he went and talked to people and photographed and listened and wrote down and he did a really good job of it the best in that time period
1079	1	to me there is no point in trying to convince them otherwise it is a waste of time most white people are so farin with these beliefs that even when you show them the recent genetic studies of the past 5 years or so they still dont understand and say the same things over and over that is how badly those 3 beliefs have warped them  personally i always wonder why nas just cant solve our own problems it always has to be someone other than nas that try to fix things for us i dont really understand what convincing them otherwise is supposed to accomplish anyway even if they do get to the point where they realize the irony of the things they say all our problems are still going to be around
1080	1	i think youre an idiot
1081	1	talking about it and learn as much as you can   start paying attention to the responses you will receive when you begin to talk about it you already have an example of one on this thread   many white americans including historians will admit to atrocities but will flatly deny the truth that what has happened was and is a state sanctioned holocaust
1082	1	this was a really good comment thank you for articulating so fully i agree and i think it makes a valid point  you shouldnt throw out the baby with the bathwater here and reject all of curtis work because he may have done some things that today we would view as wrong
1083	1	ill just leave thishttpstaticfjcdncomgifswhite_1d2eca_2077817gif right here if yall dont mind
1084	1	interesting thanks for letting me know
1085	1	k
1086	1	yeah he is the only candidate ive ever heard say anything on indian affairs what a guy
1087	1	i also dont mean to be adversarial but can i ask why you are in this subreddit
1088	1	he means that it is a mistake to saythink that there were not people already in what was to become known as the united states when the puritans his ancestors came
1089	1	im not sure theyre both from around the same time apparently i agree with the woman in that video though around the world there were just things like platforms made of dirt stone or mud bricks until the ancient nonwhite egyptians started chiseling stone to make the blocksshapes uniform level straight easily stackable etc for the old world all the fancy buildings like the castles and things like that which use chiseled stone columns pillars etc all require methods and techniques the ancient egyptians came up with first as the skinheads love to continually emphasize there were also 13 story houses too but other than the platforms and houses that was about it before the egyptians the best of the old world was just mud bricks platformsstructures at a place called mohenjo daro  that is a very easy way to dismiss things too just think in terms of the prerequisite technologies that go into the making of everything that is around today then realize that none of technologies come from europe and were most definitely not invented by the thenindigenous europeans as rude as it sounds im not sure if the actual indigenous europeans contributed anything at all to the world  for example blasting off into outer space requires writing metalmetallurgy and some sort of propellant to push the rocket upward forward etc writing metal and metallurgy clearly werent invented in europe and the propellant actually comes from china now are the me and china located within the makebelieve continent of europe no theyre not were any of those ancient me inventions actually invented by the thenindigenous europeans once again the answer is no  or the gun and the cannon the idea of the gun is actually chinese they had a long narrow tube of iron or steel and put some of their gunblack powder in one end then put rocks down the tube they then lit the fuse or whatever it is called and the rocks came blasting out the open end much faster than any arrow both ideas then made their way to europe where they became the musket now think of the technologies involved in the making of a gun the cannon invented by arabs or muslims or something they used it to blast down some big defensive walls and took over constantinople that is why the country of turkey exists today  and yet today skinheads like to boast of how everything youre using is western  one more example the capitol building in the us built like that because it is supposed to be imposing and represent western power western ideology and western culture now those columns and pillars egyptian notice how it is built with chiseled stone once again egyptian where is egypt located not within europe  cute eh
1090	1	here i thought indians were from india lolcbc is just upset how most people feel on this issue and if you do not support the agendaindustry you are called a racist and other shaming language even when comments or suggestions are not racist some just do not like the truth but playing victim is an industry in this nanny state of canada
1091	1	amazing response so erudite intellectual and well considered certainly you are not spouting out improvised nonsense as white folks are pronedid curtis visit your nation what do your elders say about his visitdo you feel his writings contribute nothing which resources from that era are better in your opinioni look forward to your educated response which shows you are actually knowledgable whatsoever with curtis workthanks
1092	1	firstly i study imperialism and my scholarly work purposefully attempts to reintegrate the histories of individual native americans into the larger historical account of colonialism my work is therefore an attempt at the decolonization of history and i thank you for the citations  im now interested in reading david stannard is book american holocaust ive now read several academic reviews of the book and find them very positive although they do state that stannard focuses much of his attention on latin americayou do indicate however that the estimates stannard provides are for the entire americas north and south so your statement that the us committed genocide on 118 million native americans already begins to include some rather squishy math by bumping the numbers through heroin dissemination you again are applying numbers without much indication of your methodology also the blurb for stannard is book states during that time 15001900 the native population of the western hemisphere declined by as many as 100 million people this statement is a long long way from the us committed genocide against 118 million native americans finally how do you tease apart the acts of genocide from the unintentional spread of european diseases that would definitely have a huge impact on your accounting for european genocideto be clear i dont doubt that genocide occurred  im just not convinced that your numbers are accurateps im aware of the recent discoveries of large civilizations in the amazon and elsewhere in south america but the research there is very new and ive not encountered any scholarly claim that the collapse of these civilizations was caused by the colonization of europeans any more citations would be appreciated
1093	1	well yes there is work being done right now in the deep forests of the western amazon there are many regions that were completely cleared in rectangular patterns of more than 1000 square miles preliminary excavations have found pottery and developed agricultural soil going back at least 10000 years and possibly 50000 years there is not even papers on this stuff this is cutting edge work being done as we speak there is absolutely nothing of this size or scope and development anywhere else in the world not even close the americas were very likely the earliest homes of civilization agriculture and vast organized societies immensely predating anything from asia the middle east africa and certainly europe
1094	1	it is up to tribes to decide what makes a person a member of the tribe
1095	1	hi matchaknight this is a very interesting conversation and im thankful that you continue engaging with me even if we miss each other is points occasionally you are right that i overlooked your question about a course of action and ill try to respond to it after continuing to address the question of usperpetrated genocidewe really are wrestling with the same problems and although our political interaction with history may serve similar ends the search for historical and contemporary justice our methodologies and conclusions are somewhat at odds that is to say while we agree on one point that europeans committed genocide in the colonization of the americas we do not agree on other points that the us was responsible for 118 million native american deaths that the spread of virulent disease was mostly intentional that the definition of genocide includes assimilationi felt compelled to respond because your initial claim appeared highly exaggerated this sense is reinforced by your statement its best to err on the side of caution and go with the largest number my addressing this is not nitpicking but rather an inquiry into your methods which i believe i have questioned respectfully the problems with laying the genocide of all native americans in the western hemisphere entirely at the feet of the us government are many there are three hundred years from when europeans first started colonizing the americas 1492 to when the us government gained independence 1783 the major centers of population in the americas at the time of european landfall were in mexico and peru outside of the boundaries of what would become the us territories such as california arizona and new mexico among others were depopulated not by the us military but by the spanish colonial governments the only recorded case of attempted intentional smallpox contamination was perpetrated by british soldiers outside the thirteen colonies etcin regards to the spread of virulent diseases such as smallpox despite the gruesome tragedy at fort pitthttpsenwikipediaorgwikipontiac27s_warsiege_of_fort_pitt of the attempted spread through contagious items such as blankets and handkerchiefs the vast vast majority of infection occurred unintentionally at the moment of colonization and well into the 19th century there was no germ theoryhttpswwwredditcomraskhistorianscomments1xqab9did_europeans_intentionally_spread_diseases_to and europeans just like native americans died in huge numbers before i continue fort pitt where amherst and bouquet plotted to use smallpox infected blankets was located within british territory outside the thirteen colonies ill return to this pointyour claim that settlers would enter an area see their presence was killing off the locals disease but remain instead of leave even though they know exactly what they were causing no humanity for fellow humans is an unfortunate case of presentismhttpsenwikipediaorgwikipresentism_literary_and_historical_analysis at least in regards to colonization prior to the late19th century while you and i understand how disease works the colonists did not in fact quite the opposite colonists often understood the spread of disease among antagonistic or ambivalent native american societies as proof of the christian gods condemnation of their cultures especially their religious practices that is to say the colonists saw the diseases as judgment from a third party the divine not the result of their the europeans contaminated breath skin clothes etc it is therefore unconvincing to claim that the one identifiable case of the intentional spread of smallpox is representative of the course of infection from europeans to native americans the europeans not only did not understand the spread of germs adequately they also understood the driving force of infection as moral judgment from the christian god as well as suffering from the same deadly diseases themselves being as they were entirely unable to control outbreaks this is true for europeans up until the later scientific discoveriesso my final point in the 118 million native americans claim is really two questions what happens to your numbers when you limit your description of us genocide of native americans to acts committed by the thirteen colonies and the later united states when the us expanded its territory to california the region was already mostly depopulated through the unintentional spread of virulent disease as well as spanish slavery and the oppressive mission system are you including in your numbers the demise of the native american nations in what were british and spanish and french russian and dutch controlled areas if so your numbers will be dishonest and your claims will not be taken seriously it does occur to me that you may simply change the wording to european genocide but you probably realize that this wording takes the us off the hook when what you are attempting to do is confront historical responsibility we also disagree about the definition in as much as forced assimilation is not considered by the un to be an act of genocidehttpwwwunorgenpreventgenocideadviserpdfosapg_analysis_frameworkpdf to argue such would be to argue that all modern assimilated native americans are not native american which seems wrongheaded and unfair this is not to say that the us didnt commit genocide  i cannot stress this point enough as im not an apologist for american imperialism  but that you are being  far too liberal in both your math and your wording as someone who has had many heated discussions about history it is my strong belief that being precise in your claims will result in a stronger argument that convinces more people for this reason i do not agree with your belief that over shooting the estimate will get one in a lot less trouble than grossly under representing it less trouble with whom in regards to this statement id like to return to what i initially overlooked which was your question about the ethics and politics of historical knowledgeyou say history is written by the victors and that historians have told you that the reason history is recorded is so we can learn from it first there are many many examples or histories written by conquered peoples for one example the annals of tlatelolcohttpsenwikipediaorgwikianales_de_tlatelolco were written by mexica aristocrats shortly after the spanish conquest more contemporary examples such as thomas king is the inconvenient indian are evidence of native american writers addressing the history of colonization likewise there are those histories written by colonists who sympathized and even identified with the colonized societies second the reason for history is a constantly evolving question in the early modern period the reason for history was the glorification of kings or alternatively the creation of a legal document that would secure for the author a stipend from the crown or compensation for the costs of conquest this is to say that the writing had highly political ends if one could learn something from these earlier histories it would not be a fair or accurate lesson the famous brief history of the conquest of the indies by bartolom√© de las casashttpsenwikipediaorgwikibartolomc3a9_de_las_casas also translated as tears of the indians had the political motive of changing the spanish crowns treatment of native americans and las casas achieved this by exaggerating the violence and power of the conquistadors in the americas  representing the native americans as good christians and the spaniards as their demonic torturers the reason i bring up las casas is this there is no history free of ideology  history is a political act the question remains what is being done politically with our current knowledge of the european or american genocide of native americans personally i have witnessed a lot of cultural and political activity that attempts to both revive native american cultures through the preservation of native american languages and the creation of educational materials in those languages to reacquire territories lost during colonization and to prevent further territorial loss and degradation from resource extraction much of this ive witnessed in both canada and latin america where ive resided for most of the last decade my own family history as it relates to colonization is not unusual while my ancestors were not conquistadors they were involved in the displacement of native americans not because they wanted to push other people off their lands but because they were that part of society expelled to the frontiers that is the poor the detritus of the empire i therefore do not identify with the economic system in which im forced to participate nor do i believe in the justice that it pretends to in my research ive attempted to address that weird question of what to do knowing that my presence although accidental is at the expense of other people i do not think the way forward is to muddy the waters with numbers that are exaggerated i believe that only through a critical confrontation with the past and the present will we arrive at a just way forward asking hard questions of people and discovering better ways to ask those hard questions can be a part of that search for justiceone final thing if you want to continue addressing this problem of history then there is desperate need for more native american and mixedrace historians likewise activism and cultural activity painting music poetry dancing are important expressions that can only benefit native american cultures and you know just being a good person to your family and friends which i think is something everyone should do
1096	1	because of my interest in native american art politics and history i just finished graduate studies in which i predominantly researched native americaneuropean relations in the 16th and 17th century and i enjoy staying current on native american culture

1098	1	fair points and thank you for clarifying them thoroughly i am not going to argue modern morality law in retrospect an aids carrier is not exempt from manslaughter just because they do not know how their aids is spread or religious values their christian bible specifically teaches them to withdraw themselves from all contact with their fellow man while ill and contagious and actually teaches them about disease transmission handling unsanitary food washing themselves and their clothes etc since they are self evident and i dont have an opinion therei am a heavy mixed ethnicity individual where some of my ethnicities played a role others were survivors and some uninvolved and some unknown so i have no tribeethnicity mindsetvalues nationality etc or group to identify with but i was born on the soil in the us and have a citzenship and after learning about all this i want to use any advantages to make a difference it affords me just as an individual i can help others on a one on one basis but want to do more but since i have no responsibility to guide my actions i must search for the most effective way to spend what resources i do have to make the most impact that would result inresults in my life time help people now rather than 90400 years from now since a single individual could simply undo anything long term i could put into motion once i am not around to prevent itmuddynumbers have grabbed my attention and enlightened me far more than the facts being presented without a potentially exagerated spin no way thats impossible right let me research what really happened so i firmly disagree with you there but acknowledge and understand that this method does not impact everyone the same way but it does draw in exactly the responses i need to hear so for me and my goals it acomplishes something extrodinary that a tamer post could never sorry that reply was kinda disjointed by paragraph just how i assemble text on the flyas for what i should do thanks to the replies here including all of yours coupled with some conversations with strangers about the mattersome artists and musicians i encountered i have a good idea of what i can and will do and it channels my creative juices too so i should be able to stay the course without giving up to despair
1099	1	american holocost by david stannard oxford 1992 has the biggest estimate at 95 million to 114 million actually it includes north and south americas and the carribean and hawaii but the us has territories in all those areas as well and the figures dont include recent times as a result of things like intentional heroin dissimination into native communities etc so i bumped the estimate apropriately since it still feels on going more sourcesmander jerry in the absence of the sacred the failure of technology and the survival of the indian nations sierra club books san francisco 1992 349mankiller wilma and wallis m a chief and her people st martins press new york 1993 8memi albert the colonizer and the colonized boston beacon press 1965 151olson james and wilson r native american in the twentieth century university press 1988 11the readers digest association inc through indian eyes pleasantville new yorkmontreal 1995 338susan brill bradley u brillbradleyedu discussion group regarding the genocide of native peoplesthere is also the articles of the recent discoveries in the past few years of el darado like cities consumed by the jungle where disease the spaniards brought over likely affected them all pointing to the population of the americas being much more vast that previously believed there are also curious accounts from viking explorers of their interaction but no major loss of life via disease occured in these encountershere is an example news report how trustworthy modern news is i leave to your own judgement httpwwwtheguardiancomworld2010jan05amazondoradosatellitediscoveryi got the worse than the others all combined part from tallying the current records on genocides perpatrated and adding them up and chairman mao  is 78million accounts for the majority of that
1100	1	quality is not objective you just have horrible taste
1101	1	okay will do
1102	1	i find these sorts of responses so frustrating
1103	1	he means no white people he doesnt think in terms of the native americans who were here before the white man as anybody further he is so clueless that he made a public statement to that effect that is why i am attempting to publicize it
1104	1	well in some cases he gave objects to his subjects to wear that were not theirs and had originally been worn by other tribesto be fair though i suppose that could be considered authenticity of a kind ¬†authentic romanticization
1105	1	whoah it has been quite some time since i have read about the accounts of the massacre and even though i always had a good grasp of what happenedholy shit that guy has a town named after him but then again it is not uncommon for towns and streets in colorado to be named after indian killers
1106	1	what are you on about mate
1107	1	both work perfectly thanks
1108	1	edit forgot to mention sorry but the definition of genocide is completely not open to interpitation of words or personal definitions in anyway its article ii  in the present convention genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group as sucha killing members of the group b causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group c deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part d imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group e forcibly transferring children of the group to another grouparticle iii  the following acts shall be punishablea genocide b conspiracy to commit genocide c direct and public incitement to commit genocided attempt to commit genocide e complicity in genocide  and the un has been asking many countries in the americas including the us to make serious efforts andor admit and take responsibility but have not gotten anywhere really showing justice doesnt exist still yet but life was never fair to begin with so its a nonsense concept anywayive noticed that already about most americans ive encountered not just from white americans either unless white is being used as an attitude rather than ethnic descriptor i am hoping as well for any adjustments to my post is claimsinformation from handed down history from the recieving endpersonal i cannot know without watching someone while they speak if what they are saying is really the truth or not and if they really believe it it may still appear to be true today i started talking to people in my town about it with all this new information i learned yesterday and the responses were very disheartening like myself i think most american citizens feel they have zero influence to change anything or take the former stance of not believing what i am discussing with them at all america being a good christian country they would never do that to paraphrase but i think i am getting angry especially after how taling about it with others went today and smearing others with too much generalisim what i want is to find out exactly all the ways i can make an impactful difference without resorting to what i percieve to be violent methods though yes i know sometimes the forest needs to burn a little for it to heal itselfgrow new and flourishfor whatever meaning it has i am a hefty mix of ethnicities so i dont identify with anyone or any country outside maybe earthhuman but i do have a us citzenship and if it offers some way to be of help in this area id like to know what all i can do
1109	1	what is a white or black tribe
1110	1	wow thank you for that correction i dearly appreciate it and thank you so much for the help i am heading there this saturday for an indefinite period of time i am more than excited for what is to come any idea on how i could find someone who could help me specifically in a respectful manner or someone i should look for or is just going with the flow of it my best approach seriously thanks a lot this is very important to me cheers
1111	1	this space intentionally left blank
1112	1	mvto
1113	1	you are correct that caral is the oldest very well developed city that has been found to date in the americas which has monumental architecture stone masonry and roads there are much older sites as well but not as developed much more notable and impressive i believe though is that this advanced civilization relied on highly developed agriculture of raising cotton and manufacturing products from iti believe the op is point was that european culture is based on the coopting and appropriation of all culture and technology globally along with misappropriation of credit everything is proclaimed to have been invented and discovered by their culture as an example he pointed out that their belief in invention of things that were known to be done earlier in africa this issue is separate from influence from the americas at that time period because contact during that era was extremely limited and confined to a small number of rare cases where the ocean was crossedregarding fine stone work in general the oldest dated site globally that has this level of stone work is g√∂bekli tepe in turkey which dates back to 10000 bce the oldest sites with modern like concrete used date to 5600 bce in yugoslaviai believe still older sites will be found in the future in the americas in africa in the mideast and in asia but probably not in europe as it was settled fairly late and their cultures have always been fairly backwards compared to others
1114	1	if you will pay attention to my wording in original post you will spot things like some estimates and other partially expressive but unsureundefined terms this kind of wording always implies a seeking of correction or clarificationverification by more hits home sources a hope that some in this community may have kept better track otherwise or can verify otherwise all one has to go on the word of whomever wrote about the matters history written by the victors etc but largely you have completely ignored my post is contents it looks like and are just nit picking select words without examining the whole post is intentquestionplea could take that some number of ways that blurb is taken a bit out of context and the book covers the numbers a bit more indepth generally imo its best to err on the side of caution and go with the largest number when dealing with the mass extiction of hundreds to thousands of indigenous culturesthis would qualify as genocide in modern english terms as that word didnt exist till recently though it is hard to describe with it events from before the word was coined but the general consenus seems to be holocaustgenocidenot every tribe minded being westernized i am told though also keep in mind genocide covers erasing a culture too such as converting their religion and changing them over to another culture is culture like westernization taking their children from them and having them raised by another culture etc  over shooting the estimate will get one in a lot less trouble than grossly under representing it and even the 90114 million range is still a safe middle road it could be quite a lot higher as this was some time ago we cant really verify yetedit since you edited yours with more questions start to read those sources i listed and you will notice a trend settlers would enter an area see their presence was killing off the locals disease but remain instead of leave even though they know exactly what they were causing no humanity for fellow humans many americas colonizers were notorious for having their small pox and other sickly infected roll around in the blankets they traded to locals in good will knowing the reprecussions of those acts i am going to avoid going into the details of what went on in spaniard landed parts as it was much more direct slaughter starvation tactics etc read about what christopher columbus did to the natives personally butchering their children for dog food etc it esclated more and more as time went on not everyone coming over was out to do this but the people inolved in the formation of the us government were heavily involved as well as their kin parentsgrandparentsetc in this as you will see from the sources if you know much about how the us government is actually set up who actually votes folk into offence determines seats policy etc who the founding fathers defined as human certainly not women or slaves or uncivilized savages etc it becomes a bit more clear why i chose to say us government but it was also because i am only a legal citzen of the usa so i have nonon malacious way of affecting in the neighboring governments on these two continents and surrounding isles and wanted to keep info centered to the northen continenthope this clarifys things for you more have you figured out what to do with all thisjust as a side note ive always been under the impression because historians always are telling me it is the reason that the reason history is recorded is so we can learn from it not repeat past mistakes acknowledge and hold accountable those who commit attrocities etc but i dont see anything major being done with recorded history especially with all the revisionist history taught in school and higher learning what is your opinion on all of this and how would you use this knowledge to make life better for those still hanging onto their culture now and thats probably the real question i was trying to ask on the what can i do front
1115	1	ok well the original and primary prayer camp for the water defenders is called sacred stone camp they have a web site with news about what is going on and also documents and pages explaining the various issues the following pages might be helpful as an introduction to understanding some of the concernshttpsacredstonecamporgliteraturehttpsacredstonecamporgresolutionhttpsacredstonecamporgfederalviolationshttpsacredstonecamporgdakotaaccesspipeline

1124	1	may i ask why germany
1125	1	ha give sacred items to the government has never been a good answer
1126	1	thank you so much for your response im really interested in learning about the culture and traditions of the wendatwyandotte
1127	1	id say it was more like a rapid effort at damage control on the part of the company a commenter algirlversion has provided further information at the rindiancountry subreddit where i also posted this news in any case the refusal has been rescinded what is happening now is a game of nerves where the government is attempting to wear down the defenders by a siege rather than an assault
1128	1	he is very culturally informed if you ever get to meet him
1129	1	she is kind of obnoxious there are some things that dont need to be said idk
1130	1	yes if they had been actual eagle feathers i really think you should have sent them back to the eagle repository because these are sacred and there are many indigenous people who are waiting for feathers it is kind of like if someone found a cache of sanctified roman catholic communion wafers these should be returned to a priest as they consider this a sacred item even if most people consider it just a crackeras the feathers you have were prepared in some way by indigenous people as prayer feathers in order to comport with the white man is law by not being actual eagle feathers they are still something more than random turkey feathers because of this intent but they are also tourist items for sure as they came with a label explaining themselves i think it would be nice if you kept them and contemplated the intent of the folks that prepared them for you or if you found someone who is into native stuff and passed it along to them
1131	1	that is what im hearing from folks over there my plans havent changed until the people on the ground say they dont need people
1132	1	tlazocamati for doing this
1133	1	it is back up
1134	1	oh thank youthat guide helps a lot looking at it it seems like what i have is dyed turkey feathers now this is remembering quite a few years back but i seem to recall them coming with a tag that declared them genuine prayer feathers made by local tribesetc etc typical touristy gift shop stuff so i assume they probably came from some sort of a store does this make much of a difference in how to dispose of them
1135	1	gt many of the cherokee were offered us citizenship if they left their land and denounced their culture before the trail of tearsany citations for that
1136	1	its possible the bia can help guide you through this process  httpswwwbiagovbiaoistgsgenealogy ancestrycom can be super helpful because most people have done the hard work for you as long as you know your parents information you should be able to go back a bit and find information about your grandparents at least and with 33 you probably qualify to be adopted into a tribe which means free healthcare for you and your children if you have any or plan to  it might be a difficult process to navigate but it would be worth the effort
1137	1	hehuhits was led by a group of indigenous women
1138	1	do you have any clue if this could be native american at all though thank you very much
1139	1	no problem
1140	1	would you explain more this isnt a perspective i ever hear why do you find him to be evil
1141	1	he played a good guy in edge of america  but yeah he is been a villain in all of the highbudget films he is done
1142	1	there are 1000s on native american art styles  i only know about west coast salish and chinookan styles this is neitheri suggest you figure out what the materials are and search for art made from those materials to begin to narrow it down
1143	1	thank you for all the information i greatly appreciate it i actually know the boarding schools bit but mostly around canada is history didnt know teddy roosevelt encouraged it too
1144	1	it is from 23andme
1145	1	those dialects are not always mutually intelligible  lushootseed is its the trade language that i spoke of  i would trust them when theyre describing their languages  most tribes lost their dialects as lushootseed became easier to save due to the number of speakers   thanks vi hilbert  im not fluent but i know that counting 1 to 10 sounds very different depending on where youre from
1146	1	why
1147	1	rsubtleracism
1148	1	wow thank you so much that is very interesting this is an even better and in depth answer than i could have wished for because i didnt think about the fact that it could be turned into such a learning experience too im excited to start researching thank you maybe i will draw a chief in a headdress and a woman with her spirit guide and frame them side by side for her
1149	1	hi thank you for response i do realize that i am asking for quite a bit and if i needed to boil it down a bit id say i just wish to be less ignorantthank you again have a wonderful nightedit sorry for such a strange response i was very tired when i wrote it just couldnt fall asleepi did realise as i was writing this blurb that i wouldnt receive everything i was asking for and im ok with that i knew i was asking for a lot but i have received such a welcoming response and given so many resources to look into that i truly felt overwhelmed by it after so many years of just feeling in the dark about my gramma marshalls heritage so many people in the family claming up when i would bring it up it feels great to be given some perspective and places to start thank you again for your input and just hearing about the culture of the haudenosaunee nation which i now learned is the correct name from some of the resources i was given it was so difficult to find information when i didnt know where to starti do hope you have a wonderful day and appreciate your input once again
1150	1	i get what youre saying and no im not one of those peoplethose 5 indians or people with very little native american ancestry that they want to claim but never truly care about the culture that want to claim native american ancestry for the sake of being trendy using it as an ammo for victimhoodi noticed how a lot of whitepassing folks of the leftleaning politics all of the suddenly are wanting a slice of the victim cake to get attention or more affirmative action or wanting free benefits i just want to figure out what exactly is my american indiannative american heritage or tribe from my native ancestry so i can get in touch with those roots so far my mom has told me that my native ancestry is most likely from the yaquis in sonora mexico but she still isnt 100 sure again i dont care about any native american benefits or tribal enrollments i just want closure on what tribe my native american ancestry isso i can get in touch with it on my own free time and am just being curious of what is considered native american and so far ive gathered from everyone hereincluding yourself that being native american isnt just only about having native ancestry it is also actually practicing one tribe is culture having at least one ancestor who is enrolled and giving back to their community as you said right now i am indeed on my journey of figuring out specifically what native american ancestryonce i travel to my parents town of origin in mexico on new years weekend my apologies for my poor wording of choice of this question i made here if it comes off to everyone here as me making a mockery of real native americans which i never intended to do

1159	1	thanks for keeping an eye on this those are reasonable concerns the post has been approved and the content does seem to be original but well keep an eye on it to make sure it stays legit
1160	1	nothing in that reply said your explanation or anyone else is for that matter was wrong they just said they werent a fan explained why and recommended further resources
1161	1	good point and reasonable to bring that up to himherhowever it seems the rising hearts coalition working group who spearheaded this great project consists of members of both genders both who contributed significantly rising hearts has been closely involved in water protection issues and protests related to those it is a great groupi agree with you it is pretty weird when we have to use gender in english and in the romance languages like spanish and portuguese im not aware of any turtle island native language that has mfn gendered pronouns and objects but maybe there are some my own language has nearly two dozen noun classes which some linguists incorrectly appellate gender but it is something of a misnomer to label noun classes as gender how does your language handle itthen let is put that distraction aside what do you think about the project should the team be renamed the term red skins is a valid and important concept in my language it means indian caddo has red man as meaning indian other languages have similar concepts but not all despite this i dont think it is appropriate for white run sports teams to use this term for naming their teams given that many natives have reasonable objections to it obviously though when native run sports teams use the term for their own teams no one has any right to criticize it i hope all agree with this

1165	1	i wouldnt know what nation im actually thinking aztec which i doubt is related
1166	1	do you think it could be from any other tribe or is it not native american at all thanks
1167	1	i think it is innocent this happens a lot someone finds something and wonders if it is an ancient man made artifact there was some cool wooden posts that had these markings that looked like hieroglyphics someone posted in one of these groups a while back wondering what language it was turns out they were termite trackswhat i do think is more of the subtleracism is when there is an archaeological site that shows evidence of human presence that would be considered conclusive anywhere outside the americas but in the americas if it predates 14kbce there is a loud cry that it is a natural phenomenon since they believe we all arrived via a land bridge at that cutoff
1168	1	nothing in your post i was mostly kidding but it did seem very odd that this was posted here
1169	1	gt6 languagesi just looked it up because a lot of the time trbes here in the sound will go it is our special language when the other 4 tribes next to them speak the same language with a twist on their dialect tx ∑…ôl≈°ucid instead of x ∑…ôl≈°ucid the tulalip are made up of six tribes with 5 speaking x ∑…ôl≈°ucid lushootseed and the samish speaking xws7√°meshqen cant find the anglicized pronunciation which is related to x ∑…ôl≈°ucid
1170	1	would you explain what you mean please i understand youre comparing him to hitler but i dont know enough about this to understand why
1171	1	in his original post he says that roosevelt was one of the best presidents and also that he knew that roosevelt said the only good indian is a dead indian so he is aware of roosevelt is position on natives he then comes to a native subreddit to ask our take someone who thinks roosevelt was one of the best presidents and is aware that he wanted to kill all indians appears to me to be a roosevelt defender that they would bring this perspective to a native subreddit appears to me to be trolling or stirring up troublekindly refrain from namecalling
1172	1	here we are again with the white people come to save us and explain how we are wrong
1173	1	google hochunk i love i found at least three sources that give it but i dont have them in front of me at the moment
1174	1	would 23andnative happen to be a reference to 23andme to be very forthright is this 30 odd percent native assertion stemming from a send away ancestry test
1175	1	thank you very much for this i will look into this book i did visit upstate new york with my grandmother and mother a very long time ago when i was a kid and we had a great timewe camped out in the woods and had a no electronics no premade food even no books or papers night just the fire songs and stories it was wonderfulthank you again for the book recommendation and reminding me of a good time with my family
1176	1	tulalip is a reservation in washington    most of the people in what is now snohomish county were forced there after the point elliott treaty   there is no tulalip tribe but there are tulalip tribes  people from 6 different nations including the snohomish nation were relocated to a place called tulalip  6 people with 6 languages and a common trade language  often youll hear people say she is from tulalip which could mean the place and the people or both  youll also hear people refer to the tulalip tribes  like the tulalip tribes built a new clinic   if you ask someone where are you from  theyd say tulalip  if you ask them what nation theyre from they might say snohomish  really confused newcomers
1177	1	i think he came to be educated i know why we would think roosevelt was bad but to white america he did a lot of good for them i think he was looking for context and it sounds like he changed his opinion on him with later posts we arent going to get anywhere with white america if we attack people for not understanding our plight and as you pointed out i did the same thing with you and i apologize we have to understand that the american education system is fucked when it comes to native history and people dont really understand how bad it was it is not their fault for being ignorant i think he posted in good faith and really wanted to learn more about his relationship with natives
1178	1	no one is defending roosevelt i think they are just ignorant and looking for information dont be a dick
1179	1	possibly he is referring to the civilization program the us government had back then george washington started it in 1789 if you were an indian and wanted to be a us citizen youd be given title to 640 acres of landin 1819 the cherokee council passed a law stripping citizenship from anyone who accepted the offer from the whites cherokees who accepted these offers were considered citizens of states in which they resided and were considered expatriates of the cherokee nation see chief hicks letter to meigs on march 20 1820 for a discussion of this
1180	1	where did u get it
1181	1	i need more of an explanation here gt its the trade language that i spoke of the one prior to chinook jargon or are you talking about lushootseedthe five tribes duwamish snoqualmie snohomish sauksuiattle skagit and stillaguamish all spoke lushootseed they had tribal dialects that might be influenced by other languages they interacted with but it is not nearly as different as samish which linguistically is closer to the skllalam languagegtmost tribes lost their dialects as lushootseed became easier to save due to the number of speakers thanks vi hilbert are we talking about lushootseed speaking tribes losing their own dialects or are we talking about other coast salish languages in the sound
1182	1	i didnt promote that roosevelt was a good guy i said ive only ever heard of him being conveyed as a good guy despite the dead indians quote and im in no way trolling or downplaying anything he did very clearly i said i didnt know much of anything about this i didnt know about the sand creek thing until you just now mentioned iti didnt intend to start defending myself in this but youre taking it there so i might as well mention ive been a hardcore advocate for native americans all my life i reblog donation links to the people who are fighting against the shitty pipeline in the middle of the us i study books about native american cultures i do my damnedest to listen to your plights and help and understand when i can in no way was this post intended to mock you again i very bluntly said i dont know much about this particular situation i came here looking for answers which youve thankfully given me a few which i appreciate id like to know more im sure there is more than just the sand creek thing and i want to know about it that is literally it if you have more information i want to know about it if youre willing to share it
1183	1	american indian boarding schoolsnative american boarding schools were established in the united states during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to educate and assimilate native american children and youths according to euroamerican standards these boarding schools were first established by christian missionaries of various denominations who often started schools on reservations and founded boarding schools in order to provide opportunities to children who did not live near colonial schools especially in the lightly populated areas of the west the government paid religious orders to provide education to native american children on reservations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the bureau of indian affairs bia founded additional boarding schools based on the assimilation model of the offreservation carlisle indian industrial school pmhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetokittens_from_space  exclude mehttpsredditcommessagecomposetowikitextbotampmessageexcludemeampsubjectexcludeme  exclude from subreddithttpsnpredditcomrnativeamericanaboutbanned  faq  informationhttpsnpredditcomrwikitextbotwikiindex  sourcehttpsgithubcomkittenswolfwikitextbot  donatehttpswwwredditcomrwikitextbotwikidonate   downvote to remove  v028

1188	1	nah not really we dont have many native producers and they definitely arent in the upper echelon of film i want a good movie that has native consultants to make sure they get it right and dont change shit rather than a crappy indie movie thats accurate but low quality
1189	1	idk sometimes i wondered if living on the res was actually even living
1190	1	i do not agree that the title of the article is a negative thing however i am already aware of the semantics of the cobell buyback program which is to place traditional lands of a tribe into federal ownership so that it falls under federal trust jurisdiction and title this benefits many tribes but also has many problematic issues since this system where tribal lands are held in title by the us government  rather than the tribes as legitimate sovereign nations capable of legally owning according to occupier reasoning their own lands held for thousands of years  is highly questionable and problematic
1191	1	thanks for the info i really appreciate it
1192	1	did you only read the beginning
1193	1	the native american  american indian paradigm also played out with negro  african american  black and come to think of it with  disabled  handicapped  special needs  insane  mentally ill  moron  retarded  intellectually disabledwords start out with a specific meaning and then we ascribe other meaning to it often negative eg retard and special are now insultsthat being said there is no excuse for using native to mean nativeborn like obama is hawaiian and a nativeborn hawaiian but he is not a native hawaiianin my opinion the washington examiner is thisclose to being a white supremacist publication and they are doing it on purpose for a political agenda according to wikipedia the examiner is known for its conservative political stance and features many prominent conservative writersi think it is important to know the political leanings of publications and this is important to also be able to see through the other choices made by a publicationfor example the guardian is a liberal publication it is not a farleft publication they choose feature stories based on what interests them as liberals such as climate change police shootings and metoo but they cover these stories fairly they dont pick and choose the police shooting stats to make it look like everyone shot by a cop is an innocent black child they gather the numbers on all of it and fairly describe trends they do not say as a reporter police are corrupt and they dont interview people who only give incendary quotes like that they give the evidence they get quotes of value that is it what makes it liberal is that then the editor is letter will be some black lives matter belief stuff  it wont be in the news it will be in opinionwhen opinion bleeds into news it is bias the washington examiner is more biased than other publications your utah pubs are also going to be biased to be promormon because utah is practically a closed society where nonmormons are considered weirdso my advice is to look very closely at where these articles are coming from and distrust bullshit publications hth
1194	1	thank you

1196	1	judaism had the seder to do just that  everyone gets in line or some such and simply apologizes to each person iirc
1197	1	gt but what is probably the most important is the op knows that they dont have to do anything with the information given to them that it is their decision because it is their identityagain i am confused why present apathy as an option i would advise op to research and learn as much as possible about the information he was given
1198	1	this isnt a positive example of using native garments from what i understand many native peoples have been forbidden and ridiculed for wearing traditional dress under the appropriate circumstances it is terribly offensive for someone else to be able to wear it as something exotic
1199	1	gtbe proud of who you are no matter the raceyou offer some great advice amp words of wisdom  we cant do anything about how we were born into this life what race to which parents and what our ancestors may have chosen to do in their livesbut the way to be proud of oneself is thru the choices each of us makes it our own lives

1204	1	i appreciate that
1205	1	what native cards do you speak of you dont decide blood quantum each individual tribe does colonization has been hard for every indigenous group in the americas saying southern natives had it harder or that northern tribes shouldnt get to be native because they dont speak their language lest we forget our elders were forced to stop speaking their language  many were sent away to boarding schools and forced then to assimilate or face punishment it shouldnt really be about who had it worse it should be about all of us collectively supporting one another and preserving our cultures

1214	1	am i chadwick boseman
1215	1	gt a first cousin would be a brother or a sisterthis is a really common perspective from many tribes as i understand it it follows from the practice in matrilineal nations where boys are trained as warriors priests hunters husbands etc by their maternal uncle rather than their father so your cousins are your siblings
1216	1	doesnt make it not lazy or not ignorant like when they do it for any language id say it is lazy and ignorant languages have names and if you refer to every language you dont know as foreign dont you think that is kind of lazy and ignorant

1218	1	no doubt its lazy i agree i was just saying what foreign means
1219	1	good and fair point the subtitles are for the vieweri just think its crazy that in a scene where a native american is talking to a european settler in s dakota they refer to him as foreign

1248	1	capitalism isnt bad its the politics that make it bad capitalism i agree is out of control with politicians being the mask to do their bad deeds we are letting the companies get free of doing anything because not that they didnt do anything wrong but because they have more money
1249	1	oh i didnt even notice that was just pointing out that navajo and apache people are athabascan
1250	1	atanarjuat the fast runner is one but more would be great
1251	1	nice  i think that means i live in the iroquois confederacy now
1252	1	i think you mean capitalism capitalism needs to stop and end we shouldnt be making money off of everything
1253	1	that is kind of along the same lines as my family oglala lakota sioux  i was taught that white animals were spirits sent to guide you or warn you so were not supposed to kill them my friend and i were on a 2 hour trip and we accidentally hit a white badger very rare and we both teared up
1254	1	im glad you liked it it made me happy to see too powwow isnt part of my tradition but im an urban ndn and there are gatherings in my community that i go to when i can it always makes me feel better to be with community
1255	1	check out snotty nose rez kids two rappers young d and yung trybez both haisla came together and created the duo in response to youth suicides along the western coast they strive to create music that would help people feel proud about where they come from their album average savage was shortlisted for the polaris prize a prize awarded to a canadian artist for an album of exceptional artistic meritmy favourites are clash of the clans northern lights indian car and black blood e also long hair dont care
1256	1	how are you conflating these issues youre not really native huh this bimbo chose to appropriate culture for an insta pic  no one said anything about ancestors
1257	1	thanks so much uhazelpie   you put a big smile on my face amp in my heart right nowthanks  were a smaller tribe only about 10000 of us who have menominee blood living in this whole world so it is always nice to see stories like this about tribal members in the news   im sure her family is beaming wpridethis was a good idea too for all the natives there in kuwait who participated in this  betcha most of the other service members at the camp probably had never been to a powwow before eithergtshe is known for her chili and maple pecan cakelove it  thanks again for sharing this  take care
1258	1	native and anthropologist here wish i could upvote this comment more
1259	1	i produced this httpsyoutubeqjf3fmicuiyt6httpsyoutubeqjf3fmicuiyt6
1260	1	they worked with the cree to try to be as accurate as possible  if tv or movies do this i dont see a problem with it but taking the concept of the wendigo and changing it to fit what they want it to be isnt cool
1261	1	my daughter calls me indian tech support  she understands exactly how irritating that is  lol
1262	1	love this one too
1263	1	oh wild i had no clue i always thought that athabaskanathabascan referred to the people native to the yukon
1264	1	i knew someone was going to say that its just that the collision of two completely different civilizations especially in the aztecs case was a really interesting moment in history
1265	1	good to hear thank you
1266	1	thank you so much that would be amazing
1267	1	try taking an ancestry dna test  youre probably less than that  in the end blood quantum is a bia creation to end tribal sovereignty
1268	1	it sucks that im learning this just now but i am grateful for the info i wish there were more resources online to learn about native history
1269	1	i didnt remove your post myself but i agree its removal was very reasonable you made a post that was questionable attacking a racial group as being genetically flawed your post history then showed that since your fairly new account was created you have been trolling other groups including telling people to go back to mexico this was evidence you were not sincerely participating here with the post
1270	1	the mods are at christmas parties for the next 24hr everything on this sub is legal
1271	1	yes there is many old laws that dont fit today and now understand what you were saying
1272	1	is op chadwick boseman
1273	1	replace rez with village  yup
1274	1	how else would they keep you brainwashed
1275	1	first cousins are siblings and are usually raised together the extended family not only trained but also disciplined and reinforced societal behaviors norms beliefs and ethics gender roles were malleable there are stories in my tribe of women who did ride into battle also our messiah figure is a woman men had societies just as women the societies all focused on aspects of life from hunting and scouting to going to war as well as crafts language sing and dance
1276	1	really good movie but hollywood as fuck  plus let is just get indigenous directors too
1277	1	because it is an option my opinion that op should like you said research and learn as much as possible about their ancestry does not matter if that is not what they want to do while i feel that you and i would do the same thing in op is shoes i am not here to convince anyone of anything not to say that you are just here to give information as a guide
1278	1	it is not that i dont want to hear about the issues i understand there are so problems i just dont understand what this white woman has to do with anything wouldnt it be more of a stance to go the opposite of hate and thank her for showing positive examples of using native garmentsshould we stop wearing sneakers and saying lit or stop dressing in urban black youth clothing if we are not black to me the issue is with the federal reserve the career politicians the drug war military industrial complex special interest groups human trafficking etc it isnt this white woman it just seems like low hanging fruit easy stuff to bitch about while on your phone there are problems everywhere not just on native lands there are children living rn in basements and with people who dont care about them im sorry but native or not this white girl should be the least of your worries like tupac said once you get the pride for your people damn near two seconds later comes the anger i feel natives hispanics blacks etc are stuck in the anger part of their trauma again like tupac said we need to find our way out of the anger there is a big difference between creating a plan and internet bitching httpsyoutube0yfmo1ndnnc
1279	1	okay im kind of glad to hear this because i thought it was a little much but then i wondered if it was because i was being insensitive to the racial plight of native americansdo you get many of the stereotypical comments mentioned if you talk about being native do white people often usually thinksay those things i am a little confused about the percentage thing i havent ever asked that of anyone but my main lineage is polish and i am proud of my polish side and people usually ask which side or what percent or whatever when i bring it up is it more offensive to native americans because of the blood quantum requirements or is it not really offensive to most natives either then again my birthday is completely not at all personal to me so im not sure these actors are being for real
1280	1	foreign means unfamiliar english is the most familiar language in na right now so technically is foreign
1281	1	okay you support racists cool
1282	1	there are many stories among the tribes my tribe has numerous stories focusing on how we came to be on this land there are 573 federally recognized tribes within the us american indiansalaska natives native americans comprise 2 of the population note first nation is the term for tribes and tribal people in canada native americans is the term for tribes and tribal people in the us your welcome thank you for asking please feel free to ask other questions
1283	1	you are correct but the media is repositioning seems intentional this isnt their only repositioning they have been doing this with other races too  eg they have also been repositioning indians from india as middleeast indians trying to bracket those indians with arabs in the middle east when india is actually in asia such things arent an accident given that the media seems to do this in collusion
1284	1	sorry didnt mean to offend
1285	1	alright then ill give another go if you feel so strongly about it im from the grandmaster flash and furious 5 school
1286	1	thank you for coming in here to learn and understand you are 100 correct even if she was firstnations it would still be disrespectful
1287	1	screw that send in littlefeather to reject it again
1288	1	i wonder if native people are more susceptible to inherit the gene mutation that causes red hair
1289	1	i keep saying this nobody listens they want to be outraged
1290	1	maybe take the test that shows close relatives
1291	1	give back the land and resources
1292	1	i thought the same thing
1293	1	hurrah

1295	1	the dead lands
1296	1	hitler killing jewseveryone else its cool just ignore it and let it slide we should say sorry for bothering hitler
1297	1	perhaps i suppose keep stressing the little things
1298	1	he has the rest of his life to learn about the culture of his tribes dissuading him from enrollment just because he was never told the truth is a dishonor to his ancestry edit i do agree that he needs to investigate the validity of what he was told
1299	1	gt my elders agree with you which is why they still insist upon american indian when speaking about american indigenous peoples and their ancestorsalmost every native american i know and i know several thousand  i used to work on a reservation  refers to themselves as indian
1300	1	yeah he enforced it but the systems main basis was set up in the obama era to be what it is now
1301	1	ive heard of climate change being a factor in the collapse of the maya in the classic period
1302	1	snrk is not so bad id like it better if the beat was traditional not cloned east coast crap
1303	1	its hyperbole the point is if we just always went along with our days ignoring everything it would just get worse

1310	1	i said right to you bro and asked the question for you me and others that still know who they are i support what you said sorry that wasnt clear
1311	1	it is the same as it ever was  the same thing that switched minority status to ethnic diversity because this effectively shifted the focus away from women as being a sociopolitical minority
1312	1	um i guess if youre part of colonialist  america you wouldnt recognize most languages  so everyone is speaking foreign languages technically  not spanish  or choctaw  german or mandarin its all foreign when youve got your head up your ass
1313	1	i think its satire at least i hope it is because its real petty
1314	1	something about headdresses being slightly exotic and interestingtheres not much of a way to make that sound not bad
1315	1	he does say they were starving and he tried to eat as little as he could since they were covered in the oil of the indian just for a little more context but still overall very fucked up in general
1316	1	i plan on doing anything i can to help nothing too crazy in my mind yet but anything i am able to do i would love to do so
1317	1	good and fair point the subtitles are for the vieweri just think its crazy that in a scene where a native american is talking to a european settler in s dakota they refer to him as foreign
1318	1	ill check those out thank you for the tip
1319	1	i agree with this your first post just sounded a bit negative to me but this clarifies why
1320	1	and scene great take guys were winning the oscar this year yo lou diamond let is get out of here hey adam you crying
1321	1	very nice im gonna hit this
1322	1	i dont believe the women i met in alaska were from tribes native to southern alaska but i could be wrong
1323	1	like i said let is preserve all our ways i come from a very traditional family we never lost our ways either but most did we want to reclaim that there is no shame in being survivers
1324	1	this was my first thought when i saw ithowever this was 20022003 and there have been some strides in awareness since as evidenced by the fact we even notice this sort of thing today
1325	1	im not native and neither are you if you need to find a convoluted way to call yourself native in order to locate some weird sense of self value then you need to reevaluate
1326	1	agreed thankyou she doesnt identify with firstnations she is australian
1327	1	only on ps4  i got one just to play this and spider man lol
1328	1	which group and which time the whole moundbuilder thing throws a lot who was here first into question according to native oral history that western science has tried to attribute to the toltecs our precolumbian and antedeluvian history is so fucked in the americas we dont have the slightest clue as to what actually happened the worst part is that nobody gives a shit stillif whoever built this and the shit that the incans took over just kept thriving id love to see what it would look like today
1329	1	yeah he completely lost me when he said he found a line to choctaw lmao like what
1330	1	whats it called id be interested to see it
1331	1	these connections and migrations are really interesting and often surprising i sometimes fancy myself knowledgable but was astonished recently when i found out the cheyenne and arapaho were east coast algonquian speakers just like the wampanoag despite now living in the foothills of the rockies as a great plains tribe well that is what it means to be indigenous living in harmonious ways with the land you live on
1332	1	im sorry im not a blood native i do follow the teachings of john trudell we are all natives we all have lineage to the earth and to indigenous peoples not you or any other blood native can erase that blunt fact i joined this group because im interested my opinions should matter just as much as yours my opinions dont come from a negative place im not here to start drama i left a comment because i care i care to wonder when will this virus of social media outrage end this bimbo has done less to affect the image of native peoples than the government httpsyoutube6qo4pik1bg
1333	1	journey towards white privilege
1334	1	from what i understand many of the maya citystates were already collapsing before the spanish came due to unknown reasons the maya obviously existed once the spanish came but they werent the thriving civilization they were before  teotihuacan which is in the picture also collapsed before the spanish the aztec empire probably would have lasted longer the inca might too and maybe even the mysterious amazonian civilization francesco de orellana claimed to have seen might also exist if it ever did exist i dont know much about the other civilizations and cultures of south and central america but it is an interesting subject
1335	1	inuit artthere is no shortage at all of that one cool source you might check out is the anchorage museum online store  httpsmuseumstoreanchoragemuseumorg
1336	1	im glad it helped  there are some very informative books and research papers out there about native blooddna politics and how that doesnt interact cohesively with native culture think nature vs nurture but what is probably the most important is the op knows that they dont have to do anything with the information given to them that it is their decision because it is their identity
1337	1	cmon people dont downvote ontopic discussion because you simply dislike the message just dont votedownvote things like offtopic bisonpucky or inflammatory trollingotherwise youre circlejerking
1338	1	huh i didnt know it was spelled a different way all of my tribal papers and everything my parents have told me always had it spelled athabaskan thank you for the links
1339	1	ill for sure do that thanks for the link
1340	1	mustve been uncanny seeing that suddenly one day at the beach
1341	1	my quarter is a mix of cheyenne cherokee and navajoim an 8th navajo alone i hope my kids look more like me but i have no idea my white side is almost all scottish and russian most people actually assume im asian mixed due to my eye shape plus im simply pale when i was a kid people thought i was latina tho due to how dark my skin was plus some extended family call my mija ive simply become a homebody i hope my kids are like yours and show their heritage but i also know that i have thin hair tho allot of it my face is the main factor that gives it away anyone who is native could tell with ease the cherokee shows strong cheekbones but soft jawline quite interesting when paired with a button nose my children is faces will likely give it away im glad they wont have to deal with kids and people who seem shocked or make a big deal of them not being white it is never hurt me when people assume but it hurts when they make a big deal out of it or when you are doing paperwork over the phone and you say your race and you can hear the shock in their voice it is like we dont exist when the most common mixed race is america is native and white but sadly with our history most of us just say we are white our whole lives back to looks i dont think my children will look very native if i end up with the guy i want to ive been crazy about him for five years but we have a deep soul connection so i havent lost hope but i also wont wait around for him he is completely white last i checked about 75 irish he has red hair he is tall and slim anyone can point him out as irish and red hair runs in my family my natural highlight is red and sometimes my body hair grows in red it is odd most dark haired people have odd blonde hairs that show up nope i have red id love red head kids but with native facial features they would be a sight to behold especially if they followed the oh so strong cherokee traits i wouldnt be surprised if they turned out darker than me even tho im darker than my mom amd my dad who are also both a fourth
1342	1	its somewhat based on algonquin mythology but most of the game doesnt deal with it  the cree are the tribe mentioned in the game but the creature is exactly how the ojibwe describe it
1343	1	are we all chadwick boseman
1344	1	anyone can appropiate culture see us natives  or erase it
1345	1	my elders agree with you which is why they still insist upon american indian when speaking about american indigenous peoples and their ancestors gen xers like me and younger folk often say native as shorthand because our generation and younger grew up around people from india we went to school with people who identify as indianamerican and so for some of us it feels silly to say indian ill say american indian in formal situations because i dont want to offend my elders
1346	1	thanks for the heads up  makes us menominee proud ennit
1347	1	i agree  even if a white person was walking around with a tattoo that read wah√°≈ãpihttpsglosbecomenlktsoup itd be more hilarious than anything else  but people dont generally get tattoos because they want to play it safe  theyre conversation starters and a visualization of a person is personal history  plus as another pointed out what he described isnt really a dream catcher anyway        ampnbsp        edit just as long as theyre not implying that theyre a native with the tattoo it is all good
1348	1	live in co  can confirm native american from ok and i thought when i first seen the native  car tags  wow hella natives nope lol
1349	1	not what youre talking about but i work in the beer industry and it is unsettling that the major appeal of beer  ethanol  is a known toxin
1350	1	i do feel that with the rash uptick of white nationalism and the power they think they need to exhibit is frightening  most tribal governments still are legal battles to make the us gov honor their treaties all this hate crime can easily shift to affect those of us who are not white looking groups of folks talking about not accepting this nationalism within our own community can strengthen our resolve as indigenous to overcome this education support solidarity it is part of what makes a tribe i would be happy if folks could post their personal views on they combat racism
1351	1	there are definitely indigenous peoples in australian  but i dont think she is one of them
1352	1	you do know mexicans are native american right
1353	1	pretty much lol
1354	1	i feel like there is a story behind the name so ive added it to my list of things to look up and research cause i genuinely find the diverse language and cultures of all the first nation peoples  absolutely fascinating so thank you for sharing
1355	1	why not just wear a really big wig
1356	1	exactly why we need to seize the means of production
1357	1	are you chadwick boseman
1358	1	ouhhh downvoted must be white indians here
1359	1	haha convoluted chal√©
1360	1	or instead of ignoring it and letting the issue persist we let people know this kind of behaviour is not okay because if one person gets away with it another 5 will copythis is also somewhere where i can talk about how this stuff bothers me so much because i dont have family in this country that understand how i feel id rather talk about it then let these issues bottle up inside
1361	1	he does a shitty job at it though
1362	1	the story is cool and their beer is really good
1363	1	thanksthis does appear to be a troll the poster doesnt seem to have any connection to this community and as you found participates in the fan group for the person in the video posted this video called for people here to be angry then went back to his fan club and posted that indians are getting restless with a link back here that looks like someone trying to stir up trouble he is probably an alias for the guy who made the video or one of his pr reps
1364	1	there are athabascan people in oregon and california too i dont really know anything about them but you could almost trace a migratory route
1365	1	it doesnt suck that you are learning this now most of the country doesnt know thanks for being curious and openminded and good luck finding the art hope you find something you like at the trickster store
1366	1	ohh well i am native american and i made it so i i think otherwisd but have yourself a great day
1367	1	right what about those of us that speak our ancient language and know our ancient tribal ways people always seem to think we dont still know our ancient ways and language
1368	1	op wants a authentic one tho not a diy and possibly isnt into diy themself
1369	1	if you dont understand you shouldnt be telling us how to feel
1370	1	were you adopted
1371	1	you gotta believe a guy who has you pinned and is threatening you with a hatchet
1372	1	that is a skookum word
1373	1	100 white dude herethe reason is because it looks cool and people are usually too indifferent to learn the cultural significance of it _„ÉÑ_ not saying its good but thats the reason
1374	1	hawkeye and scarlet witch solve a murder on the rez good times
1375	1	we couldnt see the ships remember our feeble savage minds couldnt comprehend the white mans mastery of the oceans
1376	1	you are trolling please leave this group your account is only a few minutes old and this thread is your only participation ever here most likely the racist post you showed is your own
1377	1	we just say osage  as that is our identity
1378	1	it was a killer move like a lot of stuff he does
1379	1	working with is good but hopefully only first step to say cree writers directors and producersit is good to see the culture spread but we definitely want to keep it accurate to its original sources
1380	1	comparing hitler to a costume classic
1381	1	i had no idea after reading this comment i went on to research the autobiography thank you for information its always a saddeningangry process to learn about new injustices done to the indigenous
1382	1	there is the movie mainahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvz0is9qe3308 which is about a meeting between innu and inuit people i havent seen it but ive heard good things about itone i have seen and really liked was atanarjuat the fast runnerhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvi69lbgclais which was produced entirely in the inuktitut language
1383	1	im not a fan exactly the opposite i want to expose him to a wider audience he really truly acts and thinks like this if you really looked at my history youd see i truly dislike this guy mod me if you want but it is what it is have a good one
1384	1	ive very curious about the arapaho because i believe they lived on the plains prior to the reintroduction to the horse but there is so little written about their lifeways prior to the 18th centurythe cheyenne migrated to the plains based on erect horns vision one person can shape destinies
1385	1	this system was implanted under the obama era and is only being brought up now
